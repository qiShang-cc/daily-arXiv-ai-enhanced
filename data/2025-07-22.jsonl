UAVs function as dual-purpose access points (APs), using their\nmaneuverability and line-of-sight (LoS) aerial-to-ground (A2G) links to\ntransmit combined communication and sensing signals. The scheme operates in two\ntime slots: in the first slot, UAVs transmit dedicated signals to communication\nusers (CUs) and potential targets. UAVs detect targets in specific ground\nlocations and, after signal transmission, receive reflected signals from\ntargets. In the second slot, UAVs relay these signals to HAPS, which performs\nbeamforming to align signals for each CU from various UAVs. UAVs decode\ninformation from HAPS and adjust transmissions to maximize the beam pattern\nefficiency toward the desired targets. We formulate a multi-objective\noptimization problem to maximize both the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for CUs and the echo signal\npower from the targets. This is achieved by finding the optimal power\nallocation for CUs in each UAV, subject to constraints on the maximum total\npower in each UAV and the transmitted beam pattern gain. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing network\nperformance, resource allocation, fairness, and system optimization. Using HAPS\nas the CPU, computational tasks are offloaded from UAVs, which conserves energy\nand improves network performance."}

How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best\nperformance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds\non the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is\nmeasured in terms of the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and\ncommunications performance is measured in terms of the\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires\nat most $K + \\sqrt{\\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the\nability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling\ninterference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes\n$\\sqrt{K^2 + \\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound\non the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task\nindividually. These results can be extended to sensing tasks for which the\nperformance is measured as a function of $d$ quadratic terms in the\nbeamformers.

While\nfrequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on\nFourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards\ndetrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency\nregularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional\nspatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL\nsubbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband\nin a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS\nconsistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric\nstrategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations."}

Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel\nand reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model\narchitecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to\ntransmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in\nevery global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial\nmodels for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage\nefficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an\nauxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a\nsingle model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients\nfrom the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server.\nAdditionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in\nselected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We\nprovide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its\nconvergence under non-convex loss functions. The extensive experimental results\nfurther indicate that CSE-FSL achieves a significant communication reduction\nover existing FSL solutions using real-world FL tasks."}

In Sem-TPIR, the message sizes are different, and message retrieval\nprobabilities by any user are not uniform. This is a generalization of the\nclassical PIR problem where the message sizes are equal and message retrieval\nprobabilities are identical. The earlier work on Sem-PIR considered the case of\nno collusions, i.e., the collusion parameter of $T=1$. In this paper, we\nconsider the general problem for arbitrary $T < N$. We find an upper bound on\nthe retrieval rate and design a scheme that achieves this rate, i.e., we derive\nthe exact capacity of Sem-TPIR."}
