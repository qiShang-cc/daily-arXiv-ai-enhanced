The core novelty of PCTF3D's approach (detailed in the part I article)\nrelies on the partial coupling which consists on the choice of 3D marginals to\nbe coupled. Tensor methods are ubiquitous in many applications of statistical\nlearning, with their biggest advantage of having strong uniqueness properties.\nIn this paper, the uniqueness properties of PCTF3D's constrained coupled\nlow-rank model is assessed. While probabilistic constraints of the coupled\nmodel are handled properly, it is shown that uniqueness highly depends on the\ncoupling used in PCTF3D. After proposing a Jacobian algorithm providing maximum\nrecoverable rank, different coupling strategies presented in the Part I article\nare examined with respect to their uniqueness properties. Finally, an\nidentifiability bound is given for a so-called Cartesian coupling which permits\nenhancing sufficient bounds of the literature."}

This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved\nthrough hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into\nstructured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly\nconstruct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a\nparadigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this\nhierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model\non the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,\ndense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional\nlearning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors\nwith far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,\nlanguage-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level\nreactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and\ngeneralizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents."}

However, testing\nearly prototypes directly with users can pose safety risks. To address this, we\nexplore the use of condition-specific simulation suits worn by healthy\nparticipants in controlled environments as a means to study gait changes\nassociated with various impairments and support rapid prototyping. This paper\npresents a study analyzing the impact of a hemiplegia simulation suit on gait.\nWe collected biomechanical data using a Vicon motion capture system and Delsys\nTrigno EMG and IMU sensors under four walking conditions: with and without a\nrollator, and with and without the simulation suit. The gait data was\nintegrated into a digital twin model, enabling machine learning analyses to\ndetect the use of the simulation suit and rollator, identify turning behavior,\nand evaluate how the suit affects gait over time. Our findings show that the\nsimulation suit significantly alters movement and muscle activation patterns,\nprompting users to compensate with more abrupt motions. We also identify key\nfeatures and sensor modalities that are most informative for accurately\ncapturing gait dynamics and modeling human-rollator interaction within the\ndigital twin framework."}

However, the commonly used\nModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D\ndata, size mismatches, and inadequate class differentiation, which hinder model\nperformance. This paper introduces ModelNet-R, a meticulously refined version\nof ModelNet40 designed to address these issues and serve as a more reliable\nbenchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight\ngraph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood\ngrouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with\nreduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models\ntrained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably,\nPoint-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a\nsubstantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models. This\nresearch highlights the crucial role of dataset quality in optimizing model\nefficiency for 3D point cloud classification.
