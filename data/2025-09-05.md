### [1] [Multi-Sensor Fusion for Extended Object Tracking Exploiting Active and Passive Radio Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03686)
*Hong Zhu,Alexander Venus,Erik Leitinger,Klaus Witrisal*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种贝叶斯方法，结合主动和被动的雷达测量，以解决用户遮挡导致的LOS阻塞问题，并通过PDA算法提升了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线电设备定位中，用户自身（如携带设备的用户）可能遮挡LOS链路，导致定位不准确。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出贝叶斯方法，融合主动测量和被动多基地雷达测量，引入多传感器PDA算法处理测量不确定性，并开发了针对用户的扩展对象模型。

Result: 在合成和真实无线电测量中的评估表明，该算法在OLOS条件下优于传统的基于点目标的PDA方法。

Conclusion: 论文的方法显著提高了遮挡情况下的定位精度，为复杂环境下的设备定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable and robust positioning of radio devices remains a challenging task
due to multipath propagation, hardware impairments, and interference from other
radio transmitters. A frequently overlooked but critical factor is the agent
itself, e.g., the user carrying the device, which potentially obstructs
line-of-sight (LOS) links to the base stations (anchors). This paper addresses
the problem of accurate positioning in scenarios where LOS links are partially
blocked by the agent. The agent is modeled as an extended object (EO) that
scatters, attenuates, and blocks radio signals. We propose a Bayesian method
that fuses ``active'' measurements (between device and anchors) with
``passive'' multistatic radar-type measurements (between anchors, reflected by
the EO). To handle measurement origin uncertainty, we introduce an multi-sensor
and multiple-measurement probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm that
jointly fuses all EO-related measurements. Furthermore, we develop an EO model
tailored to agents such as human users, accounting for multiple reflections
scattered off the body surface, and propose a simplified variant for
low-complexity implementation. Evaluation on both synthetic and real radio
measurements demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional
PDA methods based on point target assumptions, particularly during and after
obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) conditions.

### [2] [Sensor placement for sparse force reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03825)
*Jeunghoon Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于Gram矩阵的传感器布置策略，用于频域中的稀疏力重建，通过优化传感器位置以提高力重建的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的传感器布置方法在力重建中往往依赖启发式布局，未能充分利用频响函数矩阵的结构特性，限制了重建精度。

Method: 通过对Gram矩阵进行模态分解，发现其结构主要由目标频率附近的少数模态主导，并提出了贪婪算法优化传感器位置以减少矩阵的非对角能量。

Result: 数值模拟和实验验证表明，该方法在力估计中表现优于传统启发式布局，具有更高的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为传感器布置提供了一种基于物理洞察的实用框架，显著提升了稀疏力重建的性能。

Abstract: The present study proposes a Gram-matrix-based sensor placement strategy for
sparse force reconstruction in the frequency domain. A modal decomposition of
the Gram matrix reveals that its structure is dominated by a few modes near the
target frequency, and that each modal contribution reflects the spatial
correlation of the corresponding mode shape. This suggests that placing sensors
near nodal regions where spatial correlation is low can reduce coherence in the
frequency response function (FRF) matrix and improve force reconstruction
accuracy. To translate the physical insight into a practical design framework,
a greedy algorithm is proposed to select sensor locations that minimize the
off-diagonal energy of the Gram matrix. Numerical simulations and experimental
validations demonstrate that the proposed method yields robust and accurate
force estimation, outperforming heuristic sensor layouts.

### [3] [A Low-Cost Open-Source BLE-Based Asian Hornet Tracking System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03979)
*Gilles Callebaut,Jan Van Moer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于蓝牙低功耗（BLE）的低成本开源系统，用于定位亚洲大黄蜂巢穴，通过自定义伪噪声序列和数字波束扫描实现高精度的方向检测。

Method: 系统由轻量级BLE标签和基于GNU Radio的软件定义无线电接收器组成，通过嵌入自定义伪噪声序列实现相关检测，利用Yagi天线和PlutoSDR进行数字波束扫描以确定方向。

Result: 现场测试显示系统在50米距离内具有可靠的角分辨率，通信范围可达360米。

Conclusion: 系统为环境监测中的大黄蜂追踪提供了可扩展的开源框架，尽管调制方式增加了接收器复杂度，但支持未来的多通道扩展和标签识别功能。

Abstract: The Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) poses a serious threat to ecosystems and
beekeeping. Locating nests is essential, but usually involves time-consuming
manual triangulation. We present a low-cost, open-source tracking system based
on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The system consists of a lightweight BLE tag and
a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented in GNU Radio. By bypassing
the BLE stack, we embed a custom pseudo-noise (PN) sequence in the uncoded PHY
for correlation-based detection. Using a Yagi antenna and PlutoSDR, the
receiver performs digital beam sweeping to determine the tag's direction. Field
tests show reliable angular resolution at 50m and a communication range up to
360m. While our modulation increases receiver complexity, it enables future
improvements such as multichannel spreading and tag identification. The design
is fully open-source and provides a scalable framework for hornet tracking and
related applications in environmental monitoring.

### [4] [Approximate Message Passing for Multi-Preamble Detection in OTFS Random Access](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03980)
*Alessandro Mirri,Vishnu Teja Kunde,Enrico Paolini,Jean-Francois Chamberland*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于OTFS信号系统中前导检测的改进AMP算法，通过双重稀疏性解决了复杂域的结构化稀疏恢复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于OTFS信号的随机接入系统中多前导检测的问题，尤其关注复杂域的结构化稀疏恢复挑战。

Method: 提出了一种新的AMP算法，强制双重稀疏性：前导的稀疏选择和OTFS信号在延迟-多普勒域中的固有稀疏性，设计了新型AMP去噪器。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法实现了鲁棒的检测性能，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的AMP算法在OTFS信号的前导检测中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This article addresses the problem of multiple preamble detection in random
access systems based on orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signaling. This
challenge is formulated as a structured sparse recovery problem in the complex
domain. To tackle it, the authors propose a new approximate message passing
(AMP) algorithm that enforces double sparsity: the sparse selection of
preambles and the inherent sparsity of OTFS signals in the delay-Doppler
domain. From an algorithmic standpoint, the non-separable complex sparsity
constraint necessitates a careful derivation and leads to the design of a novel
AMP denoiser. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
robust detection performance and delivers significant gains over
state-of-the-art techniques.

### [5] [Joint Frequency-Space Sparse Reconstruction for DOA Estimation under Coherent Sources and Amplitude-Phase Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03983)
*Yutong Chen,Cong Zhou,Changsheng You,Shuo Shi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合频域和空间稀疏重建的波达方向（DOA）估计方法，解决了相干源和阵列幅相误差问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法对相干源的估计精度高于多种基准方案。

Conclusion: 该方法计算复杂度低且无需迭代优化，适用于相干源的DOA估计。

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a joint frequency-space sparse reconstruction
method for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, which effectively addresses
the issues arising from the existence of coherent sources and array
amplitude-phase errors. Specifically, by using an auxiliary source with known
angles, we first construct the real steering vectors (RSVs) based on the
spectral peaks of received signals in the frequency domain, which serve as a
complete basis matrix for compensation for amplitude-phase errors. Then, we
leverage the spectral sparsity of snapshot data in the frequency domain and the
spatial sparsity of incident directions to perform the DOA estimation according
to the sparse reconstruction method. The proposed method does not require
iterative optimization, hence exhibiting low computational complexity.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DOA estimation method achieves
higher estimation accuracy for coherent sources as compared to various
benchmark schemes.

### [6] [Robust MIMO Semantic Communication with Imperfect CSI via Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04005)

Conclusion: 该系统有效解决了信道估计误差问题，提升了语义通信的性能。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemComm) has emerged as a new communication paradigm.
To enhance efficiency, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology has
been further integrated into SemComm systems. However, existing MIMO SemComm
systems assume perfect channel matrix estimation for channel-adaptive joint
source-channel coding, which is impractical due to hardware and pilot overhead
constraints. In this paper, we propose a semantic image transmission system
with channel matrix and channel noise adaptation, named HANA-JSCC, to cope with
channel estimation errors in MIMO systems. We propose a channel matrix adaptor
that collaborates with the channel codec to adapt to misaligned channel state
information, thereby mitigating the impact of estimation errors. Since the
relationship between the estimated channel matrix and true channel matrix is
ill-posed (one-to-many), we further introduce a two-stage training strategy
with knowledge distillation to overcome the convergence difficulties caused by
the ill-posed problem. Comparing with the state-of-the-art benchmarks,
HANA-JSCC achieves $0.40\sim0.54$dB higher average performance across various
noise and estimation error levels in various datasets.

### [7] [Constellation Shaping for OFDM-ISAC Systems: From Theoretical Bounds to Practical Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04055)
*Benedikt Geiger,Fan Liu,Shihang Lu,Andrej Rode,Daniel Gil Gaviria,Charlotte Muth,Laurent Schmalen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 集成传感与通信（ISAC）通过重用通信信号进行雷达式传感，但调制格式的冲突要求导致性能权衡。本文通过星座整形（包括几何、概率和联合整形）优化正交频分复用（OFDM）系统的S&C性能，提出了一种低复杂度的广义概率幅度整形（PAS）方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在正交频分复用（OFDM）系统中通过星座整形同时优化传感和通信性能，解决其调制格式的冲突要求。

Method: 采用自编码器优化几何、概率和联合星座整形，提出了一种广义概率幅度整形（PAS）方法，并设计了低复杂度的对数似然比计算。

Result: 星座整形实现了S&C性能的灵活权衡，接近理论上限，显著优于传统调制格式。广义PAS方法具有低复杂度和高效性。

Conclusion: 星座整形和广义PAS为ISAC系统提供了灵活且低复杂度的性能优化方案，接近联合整形的性能。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) promises new use cases for
mobile communication systems by reusing the communication signal for radar-like
sensing. However, sensing and communications (S&C) impose conflicting
requirements on the modulation format, resulting in a tradeoff between their
corresponding performance. This paper investigates constellation shaping as a
means to simultaneously improve S&C performance in orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC systems. We begin by deriving how the
transmit symbols affect detection performance and derive theoretical lower and
upper bounds on the maximum achievable information rate under a given sensing
constraint. Using an autoencoder-based optimization, we investigate geometric,
probabilistic, and joint constellation shaping, where joint shaping combines
both approaches, employing both optimal maximum a-posteriori decoding and
practical bit-metric decoding. Our results show that constellation shaping
enables a flexible trade-off between S&C, can approach the derived upper bound,
and significantly outperforms conventional modulation formats. Motivated by its
practical implementation feasibility, we review probabilistic amplitude shaping
(PAS) and propose a generalization tailored to ISAC. For this generalization,
we propose a low-complexity log-likelihood ratio computation with negligible
rate loss. We demonstrate that combining conventional and generalized PAS
enables a flexible and low-complexity tradeoff between S&C, closely approaching
the performance of joint constellation shaping.

### [8] [Reliable Clutter Suppression for Slow-Moving Weak Target Radar Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04309)
*R. Zhang,J. Xue,T. Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Go分解（Godec）的杂波抑制方案，用于复杂环境中可靠检测慢速弱目标。相比传统MTI方法，Godec方案能更可靠地检测目标，但牺牲了时间复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂环境中慢速弱目标检测的挑战，避免传统MTI方法对目标信号的抑制。

Method: 利用距离-速度映射的低秩和稀疏特性，基于Godec框架设计新型杂波抑制方案。

Result: 仿真和实验验证表明，Godec方案在存在掩蔽效应时能可靠检测目标，但时间消耗较高。

Conclusion: Godec方案在可靠性和时间复杂性之间做出权衡，适用于特定场景，并提供了参数设置的指导。

Abstract: Reliable slow-moving weak target detection in complicated environments is
challenging due to the masking effects from the surrounding strong reflectors.
The traditional Moving Target Indication (MTI) may suppress the echoes from not
only the static interference objects (IOs), but also the desired slow-moving
weak target. According to the low-rank and sparse properties of the
range-velocity maps across different radar scans, a novel clutter suppression
scheme based on the Go decomposition (Godec) framework is proposed in this
paper. The simulation results show that with the existence of masking effects,
the target detection scheme based on Godec clutter suppression can reliably
detect the slow-moving weak target, compared to the traditional MTI-based
scheme. Besides, the time consumption comparison is conducted, demonstrating
that the proposed solution is one that sacrifices time complexity in exchange
for enhanced reliability. Additionally, the tradeoffs among the number of false
alarm cells, the detection probability and the iteration times for convergence
have been revealed, guiding parameter settings of the proposed solution in
practical applications. Experiment validation is also conducted to verify the
proposed solution, providing further insight into the scenarios where the
solution is most applicable.

Abstract: Relative localization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in global
navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied environments is essential for
emergency rescue and battlefield reconnaissance. Existing methods suffer from
significant localization errors among UAVs due to packet loss and high
computational complexity in large swarms. This paper proposes a
clustering-based framework where the UAVs simultaneously use communication
signals for channel estimation and ranging. Firstly, the spectral clustering is
utilized to divide the UAV swarm into different sub-clusters, where matrix
completion and multidimensional scaling yield high-precision relative
coordinates. Subsequently, a global map is created by the inter-cluster anchor
fusion. A case study of UAV integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) system
is presented, where the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is adopted for
ranging and communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method
reduces localization errors in large swarms and loss of range information. It
also explores the impact of signal parameters on communication and
localization, highlighting the interplay between communication and localization
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可扩展性、通信依赖性和动态故障鲁棒性方面存在不足，而飞机器人群协同运输在物流和灾害响应中具有变革潜力。

Conclusion: 该物理启发方法结合了群体智能和机械稳定性原则，为通信受限环境中的复杂运输任务提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: In comparison with existing approaches, which struggle with scalability,
communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures, cooperative
aerial transportation via robot swarms holds transformative potential for
logistics and disaster response. Here, we present a physics-inspired
cooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the
dissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a
decentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous
formation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of
explicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended
payload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to
energy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control
system is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors
of the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches
under the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and
payload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying
robots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success
rate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,
and 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor
winds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges
swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable
framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex
transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Result: 仿真和物理实验证明，该模型能可靠地识别可行抓取配置，具有实际适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为双机器人协作运输任务提供了一种有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decision-making in cooperative grasping for
two-robot object transport in constrained environments. The core of the
framework is a Conditional Embedding (CE) model consisting of two neural
networks that map grasp configuration information into an embedding space. The
resulting embedding vectors are then used to identify feasible grasp
configurations that allow two robots to collaboratively transport an object. To
ensure generalizability across diverse environments and object geometries, the
neural networks are trained on a dataset comprising a range of environment maps
and object shapes. We employ a supervised learning approach with negative
sampling to ensure that the learned embeddings effectively distinguish between
feasible and infeasible grasp configurations. Evaluation results across a wide
range of environments and objects in simulations demonstrate the model's
ability to reliably identify feasible grasp configurations. We further validate
the framework through experiments on a physical robotic platform, confirming
its practical applicability.

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion数据集上达到minADE 0.25的最佳性能，并通过消融实验验证多步骤稀疏路线的重要性。

Conclusion: 单端点目标可解决战略模糊性，但多步骤稀疏路线是实现高保真战术执行的关键。

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

Abstract: Accurate real-time buoyancy modeling is essential for high-fidelity
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) simulations, yet NVIDIA Isaac Sim lacks a
native buoyancy system, requiring external solutions for precise underwater

compute the submerged volume of an AUV in real time. By extracting mesh
geometry from the simulation environment and calculating the hull portion
intersecting the water level along the z-axis, our method enhances accuracy
over traditional geometric approximations. A cross-sectional area extension
reduces computational overhead, enabling efficient buoyant force updates that
adapt to orientation, depth, and sinusoidal wave fluctuations (+-0.3 m). Tested
on a custom AUV design for SAUVC 2025, this approach delivers real-time
performance and scalability, improving simulation fidelity for underwater

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Quadruped-based mobile manipulation presents significant challenges in
robotics due to the diversity of required skills, the extended task horizon,
and partial observability. After presenting a multi-stage pick-and-place task
as a succinct yet sufficiently rich setup that captures key desiderata for
quadruped-based mobile manipulation, we propose an approach that can train a
visuo-motor policy entirely in simulation, and achieve nearly 80\% success in
the real world. The policy efficiently performs search, approach, grasp,
transport, and drop into actions, with emerged behaviors such as re-grasping
and task chaining. We conduct an extensive set of real-world experiments with
ablation studies highlighting key techniques for efficient training and
effective sim-to-real transfer. Additional experiments demonstrate deployment
across a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. Demo videos and additional

*Neha Sunil,Megha Tippur,Arnau Saumell,Edward Adelson,Alberto Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双臂视觉触觉框架，用于处理复杂配置的衣物操作问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 衣物操作困难在于其复杂的配置、动态的材料特性及频繁的自遮挡。现有的系统通常需要平整衣物或假设关键特征可见。

Method: 提出了一种结合置信度感知的密集视觉对应和触觉监督抓取感知的方法，利用模拟数据集训练模型，并通过反应状态机调整策略。

Result: 系统能够处理高度遮挡的桌面和空中配置，并在折叠和悬挂任务中展示了效果。

Conclusion: 密集描述符为其他规划模式提供了可重复使用的中间表示，推动了衣物操作的普适性和扩展性。

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模态测量融合（车轮里程计、视觉里程计和IMU数据）的四轮独立转向和驱动的爬墙机器人位姿估计器设计，采用了扩展卡尔曼滤波（EKF）和无迹卡尔曼滤波（UKF）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 爬墙机器人在建筑环境中需要携带精确测量设备和维护工具，因此其位姿信息对操作至关重要。传统定位传感器（如激光、超声波或雷达）因建筑复杂几何和材料特性而不可行，GPS也因信号衰减不可靠。

Method: 采用EKF和UKF融合多传感器数据，并分别使用非线性优化、Levenberg-Marquardt方法及遗传算法、粒子群优化进行系统参数和运动学参数校准。

Result: 通过实验验证了校准方法和位姿估计器的性能与结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，该方法能有效解决爬墙机器人在复杂环境中的位姿估计问题。

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a pose estimator for a four wheel
independent steer four wheel independent drive (4WIS4WID) wall climbing mobile
robot, based on the fusion of multimodal measurements, including wheel
odometry, visual odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The pose
estimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their
operational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and
maintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the
building at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material
properties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors
such as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing
robots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these
environments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and
electromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary
source of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift
caused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the
robot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and
Levenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting
methods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as
stochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and
results of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail
with experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot.

TL;DR: FPC-VLA是一个结合视觉语言动作（VLA）和监督器的双模型框架，用于预测和纠正失败，提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感知规划在开放式任务中灵活性不足，VLA缺乏失败预测和恢复机制。

Method: 通过视觉语言查询评估动作可行性，生成纠正策略，无人工标注高效训练，相似性引导融合模块优化动作。

Result: 在SIMPLER、LIBERO等模拟平台和多种机器人上表现优于现有模型，任务成功率高且执行时间影响小。

Conclusion: FPC-VLA具有强泛化能力和实用性，适用于构建更可靠的自主系统。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However,
traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks
due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial
mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these
challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with
a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates
action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective
strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A
similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past
predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and
LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly
increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful
real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong
generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous
systems.

Abstract: While current onboard state estimation methods are adequate for most driving

interaction between tires and road surfaces. This paper explores a novel
communication concept for efficiently transmitting integrated wheel sensor data
from an ESP32 microcontroller. Our proposed approach utilizes a
publish-subscribe system, surpassing comparable solutions in the literature
regarding data transmission volume. We tested this approach on a drum tire test
rig with our prototype sensors system utilizing a diverse selection of sample
frequencies between 1 Hz and 32 000 Hz to demonstrate the efficacy of our
communication concept. The implemented prototype sensor showcases minimal data
loss, approximately 0.1 % of the sampled data, validating the reliability of
our developed communication system. This work contributes to advancing
real-time data acquisition, providing insights into optimizing integrated wheel
sensor communication.

TL;DR: 提出了自適應強化流匹配（ARFM）方法，通過結合離線強化學習進行微調，提升VLA模型在複雜任務中的動作準確性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 當前基於流匹配的VLA模型在複雜任務中動作準確性不足，因其僅依賴模仿學習，缺乏對數據分佈的深入理解。

Method: 提出離線強化學習微調目標，引入自適應調整的縮放因子，構建偏置-方差權衡的目標函數，實現穩定高效的微調。

Result: 實驗顯示ARFM在泛化性、魯棒性、少樣本學習和持續學習方面表現優異。

Conclusion: ARFM結合強化學習顯著提升了VLA模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

Motivation: 研究目标是通过结合示范数据改进深度强化学习的探索效率，特别是在机器人任务中，以减少引导误差和过拟合问题。

Result: 在模拟任务（装桶和开抽屉）中验证了方法的有效性，并在实际轮式装载机上成功部署装桶任务。

Conclusion: DRLR框架在处理低维和高维状态-动作空间任务中表现出鲁棒性，能有效减少引导误差并实现sim2real迁移。

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在机器人运动规划中高效且性能优越。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

Abstract: Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various
robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of
the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects
efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.
Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating
potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,
these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several
candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally
efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most
informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the
camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the
whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint
without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and
realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying
sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning
strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world
experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed
method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no
significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method
is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in
terms of the average time the robot spends between views.

Abstract: Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics
applications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive
tasks, facilitating data sharing, and enhancing robot coordination. However,
integrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to
network latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource
management. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for
testing cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main
components enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud
cluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system
incorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling
bidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot
simulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To
achieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for
aerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce
artificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions
encountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.

Motivation: 连续体机器人因其灵活性在非结构化和受限环境中具有优势，但其连续变形特性给运动规划和控制带来了挑战，需要准确且轻量化的模型。

Method: 提出LASEM框架，通过Hamilton原理从几何非线性梁和杆理论推导出解析前向模型，避免了显式接触建模，支持力和位移输入，适用于非均匀几何和分布式加载。

Conclusion: LASEM为连续体机器人提供了一种高效且通用的建模和控制框架，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Continuum robots, inspired by octopus arms and elephant trunks, combine
dexterity with intrinsic compliance, making them well suited for unstructured
and confined environments. Yet their continuously deformable morphology poses
challenges for motion planning and control, calling for accurate but
lightweight models. We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling
(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation
potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical
forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via
Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone
contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying
kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the
framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,
distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally
efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a
semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To
address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the
functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally
incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants
demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that

of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision

environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

critical challenge for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), due to overlapping
neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions. We introduce BiND
(Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first
classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then
uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time
index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six
state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a
publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient.
BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69
($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model
(GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session
variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up
to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the
effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing
bimanual decoding.

*Dieter Schwarzmann,Simon Käser*

TL;DR: 本文分析了采样时间抖动的影响，提出了将抖动影响的线性时不变系统重新解释为等效的无抖动系统的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在分析采样时间抖动对系统的影响，为实践者提供解决方案。

Method: 通过构建一个感知系统，将时间扰动的影响纳入其动态中，提出了等效的无抖动系统模型。

Result: 研究发现抖动可以视为系统矩阵的缩放，并在拉普拉斯域中表现为频率缩放。

Conclusion: 抖动对系统的影响可以通过等效模型进行量化，为系统分析和设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: This brief, aimed at practitioners, offers an analysis of the effect of
sampling-time jitter, i. e., the error produced by execution-time inaccuracies.
We propose reinterpreting jitter-afflicted linear time-invariant systems
through equivalent jitter-free analogs. By constructing a perceived system that
absorbs the effects of timing perturbations into its dynamics, we find an
affine scaling of jitter. We examine both measurement and implementation
scenarios, demonstrating that the presence of jitter effectively scales the
system matrices. Moreover, we observe that, in the Laplace domain, jitter can
be interpreted as a frequency scaling.

*Cédric Join,Michel Fliess*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于平坦性控制和模型自由预测控制的方法，用于解决与意外障碍物的碰撞避免问题，替代了需要大量试验的强化学习方法。实验结果显示，该方法计算负担低且具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对强化学习需要大量试验的批评，本文旨在探索替代方法，以更高效地解决碰撞避免问题。

Method: 结合平坦性控制和HEOL反馈设置，以及最新的模型自由预测控制方法，使用Dubins' car模型进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，模型自由预测控制方法在鲁棒性方面优于模型方法，且两种方法均计算负担低。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在碰撞避免中表现出色，且计算效率高，优于当前流行的机器学习技术。

Abstract: This communication on collision avoidance with unexpected obstacles is
motivated by some critical appraisals on reinforcement learning (RL) which
"requires ridiculously large numbers of trials to learn any new task" (Yann
LeCun). We use the classic Dubins' car in order to replace RL with
flatness-based control, combined with the HEOL feedback setting, and the latest
model-free predictive control approach. The two approaches lead to convincing
computer experiments where the results with the model-based one are only
slightly better. They exhibit a satisfactory robustness with respect to
randomly generated mismatches/disturbances, which become excellent in the
model-free case. Those properties would have been perhaps difficult to obtain
with today's popular machine learning techniques in AI. Finally, we should
emphasize that our two methods require a low computational burden.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多控制屏障函数（CBFs）的非线性系统约束控制框架，用于处理向量值输出的箱型约束，证明了其局部Lipschitz连续性和闭式表达可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献大多聚焦于单一CBF约束，难以合成多状态约束的可证明安全控制器。

Method: 采用多CBFs处理向量值输出的箱型约束，要求输出具有向量相对度。

Result: 优化控制器具有局部Lipschitz连续性并支持闭式表达，同时分析了安全约束对名义跟踪目标的性能影响。

Conclusion: 通过平面四旋翼飞行器的仿真验证，所提框架在多约束条件下效果显著。

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for the constrained
control of nonlinear systems; however, the majority of results in the
literature focus on systems subject to a single CBF constraint, making it
challenging to synthesize provably safe controllers that handle multiple state
constraints. This paper presents a framework for constrained control of
nonlinear systems subject to box constraints on the systems' vector-valued
outputs using multiple CBFs. Our results illustrate that when the output has a
vector relative degree, the CBF constraints encoding these box constraints are
compatible, and the resulting optimization-based controller is locally
Lipschitz continuous and admits a closed-form expression. Additional results
are presented to characterize the degradation of nominal tracking objectives in
the presence of safety constraints. Simulations of a planar quadrotor are
presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何利用动态系统中的对称性（或称为等变性）来简化控制屏障函数（CBF）的合成过程。虽然CBF本身通常不具备对称性，但作者证明了动态系统的等变性和约束的对称性会通过可达性分析在CBF中诱导出对称性，从而大幅减少计算量。此外，研究还展示了如何利用部分已知的CBF和非对称约束来合成新的CBF，并通过数值研究验证了计算效率的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBF合成通常需要大量计算或复杂构造，而动态系统的结构特性和约束的对称性可能简化这一过程。本文希望通过探索动态系统的等变性及其与约束对称性的关联，为CBF合成提供更高效的方法。

Method: 作者利用动态系统的等变性和约束的对称性，通过可达性分析在CBF中诱导出对称性，从而将其值从子集推断到整个域。此外，还研究了如何结合部分已知的CBF和非对称约束来合成新的CBF。

Result: 理论分析和数值研究表明，利用动态系统的等变性可以显著减少CBF合成的计算量，并且能够扩展到非对称约束的CBF合成。

Conclusion: 动态系统的等变性和约束对称性可以高效地用于CBF合成，不仅提高了计算效率，还拓展了其在非对称约束中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The synthesis of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) often involves demanding
computations or a meticulous construction. However, structural properties of
the system dynamics and constraints have the potential to mitigate these
challenges. In this paper, we explore how equivariances in the dynamics,
loosely speaking a form of symmetry, can be leveraged in the CBF synthesis.
Although CBFs are generally not inherently symmetric, we show how equivariances
in the dynamics and symmetries in the constraints induce symmetries in CBFs
derived through reachability analysis. This insight allows us to infer their
CBF values across the entire domain from their values on a subset, leading to
significant computational savings. Interestingly, equivariances can be even
leveraged to the CBF synthesis for non-symmetric constraints. Specifically, we
show how a partially known CBF can be leveraged together with equivariances to
construct a CBF for various new constraints. Throughout the paper, we provide
examples illustrating the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a numerical study
investigates the computational gains from invoking equivariances into the CBF
synthesis.

*Babak Esmaeili,Hamidreza Modares*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全数据驱动的运动规划框架，用于多智能体系统，基于局部不变量椭球和反馈增益构建安全区域，并通过时空预留表协调避障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体在共享且充满障碍的工作空间中运动规划的问题，且无需显式系统模型。

Method: 通过凸半定规划从数据中学习局部不变量椭球和对应反馈增益，采样规划器构建路径树，并通过时空预留表协调避障。

Result: 仿真结果表明，框架能生成动态可行且安全的多智能体轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架仅依赖数据和凸优化工具，实现了多智能体的同步与安全运动规划。

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机配备先进传感器为风电场监测提供了新机会，但可靠缺陷检测需要高分辨率数据和高效处理方法。

Method: 提出一种集成方法，结合通用YOLOv8模型和专用热模型，通过边界框融合算法整合预测。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法的mAP@.5达到0.93，F1分数为0.90，优于单独的YOLOv8模型。

Conclusion: 多YOLO架构与多光谱数据融合提供了更可靠的解决方案，提升了视觉和热缺陷的检测能力。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Conclusion: 该研究为SNN在手指力解码中的集成提供了实用方案，输入模态的选择可根据应用需求优化准确性、稳健性和内存效率。

Abstract: Restoring naturalistic finger control in assistive technologies requires the
continuous decoding of motor intent with high accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness. Here, we present a spike-based decoding framework that integrates
spiking neural networks (SNNs) with motor unit activity extracted from
high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays. We demonstrate simultaneous
and proportional decoding of individual finger forces from motor unit spike
trains during isometric contractions at 15% of maximum voluntary contraction
using SNNs. We systematically evaluated alternative SNN decoder configurations
and compared two possible input modalities: physiologically grounded motor unit
spike trains and spike-encoded intramuscular EMG signals. Through this
comparison, we quantified trade-offs between decoding accuracy, memory
footprint, and robustness to input errors. The results showed that shallow SNNs
can reliably decode finger-level motor intent with competitive accuracy and
minimal latency, while operating with reduced memory requirements and without
the need for external preprocessing buffers. This work provides a practical
blueprint for integrating SNNs into finger-level force decoding systems,
demonstrating how the choice of input representation can be strategically
tailored to meet application-specific requirements for accuracy, robustness,
and memory efficiency.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 社会机器人在幸福辅导中被认为是重要支持者，但用户隐私感知的关键因素包括信息使用的透明度、用户控制水平和机器人行为方式。研究表明用户控制对隐私感知影响最大，透明度和主动性影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨影响用户在使用社会机器人进行幸福辅导时隐私感知的三个关键因素，以填补当前对隐私认知理解的空白。

Method: 通过在线研究（N=200）系统地考察透明度、用户控制和机器人行为方式对隐私感知的影响。

Result: 用户即使授予机器人对个人数据的访问权限，仍期望能够明确控制信息的解释和共享方式。用户控制显著提高了隐私适当性和信任评分，透明度和主动性的影响较小且不显著。

Conclusion: 仅提供信息或主动共享不足以满足用户隐私需求，未来研究需关注允许用户管理机器人信息处理的机制，尤其是在机器人承担更主动角色的情况下。

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly recognized as valuable supporters in the field
of well-being coaching. They can function as independent coaches or provide
support alongside human coaches, and healthcare professionals. In coaching
interactions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,
making privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the
factors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine
three key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,
(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their
information, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts
proactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =
200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,
they additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information
is interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that
provided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived
privacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of
transparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,
and we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing
users or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.
These insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that
allow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially
when social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans.
