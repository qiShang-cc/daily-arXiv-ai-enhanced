One of the main challenges in diagnosing and treating sleep\napnea is identifying individuals at risk. The current gold standard for\ndiagnosis, Polysomnography (PSG), is costly, labor intensive, and inconvenient,\noften resulting in poor quality sleep data. This paper presents a novel\napproach to the detection of sleep apnea using a Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) trained on single channel EEG data. The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy\nof 85.1% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.22, demonstrating a\nsignificant potential for home based applications by addressing the limitations\nof PSG in automated sleep apnea detection. Key contributions of this work also\ninclude the development of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with an\nInfinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth filter, a dataset construction\nmethod providing broader temporal context, and the application of SMOTETomek to\naddress class imbalance. This research underscores the feasibility of\ntransitioning from traditional laboratory based diagnostics to more accessible,\nautomated home based solutions, improving patient outcomes and broadening the\naccessibility of sleep disorder diagnostics."}

Project website: https://machines-in-motion.github.io/DMO/", "summary": "There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that\nleverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While\nearly gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared\nto derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical\ndue to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can\napproximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver\nefficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,\nwhich can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples\ntrajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled\nusing a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a\nlearned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables\nefficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator\ngradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation\nrollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and\nspeed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality\nof standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other\nfirst-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark\ncontrol tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,\nacross both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks."}

In this work, we propose to\nachieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient\nFine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small\namount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong\nperformance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored\nfor geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of\nbalancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.\nTo this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,\nwhich structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds\nof effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we\nadaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular\ndirections for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned\nweight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction\nregularization based on the stable--rank.

However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory\nPrediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g.,\ntrajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs\n(multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary\ndifficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future\ntrajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This\nresearch presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic\nmethodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem\nthrough metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic\nnature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both\nhistorical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an\nenvironmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric\ntransformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and\nmap inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2)\nMap-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing\nobstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions.
