However, conventional methods relying on Time-Frequency Analysis (TFA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face two fundamental limitations: severe performance degradation in low Jamming-to-Signal Ratio (JSR) regimes due to noise obscuration, and ``feature degeneracy'' caused by the loss of phase information in magnitude-only spectrograms. Consequently, spectrally similar signals -- such as high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation versus Band-Limited Gaussian Noise -- become indistinguishable. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes the \\textbf{JSR-Guided Fusion Network (JSR-GFNet)}. This multi-modal architecture combines phase-sensitive complex In-Phase/Quadrature (IQ) samples with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms. Central to this framework is a physics-inspired dynamic gating mechanism driven by statistical signal descriptors. Acting as a conditional controller, it autonomously estimates signal reliability to dynamically reweight the contributions of a Complex-Valued ResNet (IQ stream) and an EfficientNet backbone (STFT stream). To validate the model, we introduce the Comprehensive GNSS Interference (CGI-21) dataset, simulating 21 jamming categories including software-defined waveforms from aerial platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JSR-GFNet achieves higher accuracy across the full 10--50 dB JSR spectrum. Notably, interpretability analysis confirms that the model learns a physically intuitive strategy: prioritizing spectral energy integration in noise-limited regimes while shifting focus to phase precision in high-SNR scenarios to resolve modulation ambiguities. This framework provides a robust solution for next-generation aerospace navigation security."}

This paper presents a sub-band full-duplex (SBFD) ISAC system that assigns non-overlapping OFDM subbands to sensing and communication, enabling simultaneous operation with minimal interference. A distributed testbed with three SIMO nodes is implemented using USRP X410 devices operating at 6.8 GHz with 20 MHz bandwidth per channel. A total of 2048 OFDM subcarriers are partitioned into three subbands: two for sensing using Zadoff-Chu sequences and one for communication using QPSK. Each USRP transmits one subband while receiving signals across all three, forming a 1 x 3 SIMO node. Time synchronization is achieved through host-server coordination without external clock distribution. Indoor measurements, validated against MOCAP ground truth, confirm the feasibility of the SBFD ISAC system. The results demonstrate monostatic sensing with a velocity resolution of 0.145 m/s, and communication under NLoS conditions with a BER of 3.63e-3. Compared with a multiband benchmark requiring three times more spectrum, the SBFD configuration achieves comparable velocity estimation accuracy while conserving resources. The sensing and communication performance trade-off is determined by subcarrier allocation strategy rather than mutual interference."}

The framework jointly learns map generation and action prediction, distilling environmental context into a compact three-channel BEV map that preserves only navigation-critical affordances.

However, forwarding raw CSI from multiple BSs to a central unit (CU) incurs prohibitive fronthaul overhead, which limits scalable cooperative positioning in practice. This paper proposes a learning-based edge-cloud cooperative positioning framework under limited-capacity fronthaul constraints. In the proposed architecture, a neural network is deployed at each BS to compress the locally estimated CSI into a quantized representation subject to a fixed fronthaul payload. The quantized CSI is transmitted to the CU, which performs cooperative 3D positioning by jointly processing the compressed CSI received from multiple BSs. The proposed framework adopts a two-stage training strategy consisting of self-supervised local training at the BSs and end-to-end joint training for positioning at the CU. Simulation results based on a 3.5~GHz 5G NR compliant urban ray-tracing scenario with six BSs and 20~MHz bandwidth show that the proposed method achieves a mean 3D positioning error of 0.48~m and a 90th-percentile error of 0.83~m, while reducing the fronthaul payload to 6.25% of lossless CSI forwarding. The achieved performance is close to that of cooperative positioning with full CSI exchange."}

We introduce ZEST (Zero-shot Embodied Skill Transfer), a streamlined motion-imitation framework that trains policies via reinforcement learning from diverse sources -- high-fidelity motion capture, noisy monocular video, and non-physics-constrained animation -- and deploys them to hardware zero-shot. ZEST generalizes across behaviors and platforms while avoiding contact labels, reference or observation windows, state estimators, and extensive reward shaping. Its training pipeline combines adaptive sampling, which focuses training on difficult motion segments, and an automatic curriculum using a model-based assistive wrench, together enabling dynamic, long-horizon maneuvers. We further provide a procedure for selecting joint-level gains from approximate analytical armature values for closed-chain actuators, along with a refined model of actuators. Trained entirely in simulation with moderate domain randomization, ZEST demonstrates remarkable generality. On Boston Dynamics' Atlas humanoid, ZEST learns dynamic, multi-contact skills (e.g., army crawl, breakdancing) from motion capture. It transfers expressive dance and scene-interaction skills, such as box-climbing, directly from videos to Atlas and the Unitree G1.

The CMA encoder injects a physically grounded prior--per-BS channel gain--into the attention weights, thus emphasizing reliable links and suppressing spurious multipath. A lightweight LSTM decoder then treats subcarriers as a sequence to accumulate frequency-domain evidence into a final 3D position estimate.

To address this gap, a decentralized approach for outer-loop control of large multi-agent systems based on the paradigm of how a fluid moves through a volume is proposed and evaluated. A relationship between fundamental fluidic element properties and individual robotic agent states is developed such that the corresponding swarm \"flows\" through a space, akin to a fluid when forced via a pressure boundary condition. By ascribing fluid-like properties to subsets of agents, the swarm evolves collectively while maintaining desirable structure and coherence without explicit communication of agent states within or outside of the swarm. The approach is evaluated using simulations involving $O(10^3)$ quadcopter agents and compared against Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions for a converging-diverging domain. Quantitative agreement between swarm-derived and CFD fields is assessed using Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), yielding normalized errors of 0.15-0.9 for velocity, 0.61-0.98 for density, 0-0.937 for pressure. These results demonstrate the feasibility of treating large robotic swarms as continuum systems that retain the macroscopic structure derived from first principles, providing a basis for scalable and decentralized control."}

Using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to statistically model the HQN, we construct as well as visualize the corresponding pointwise entropic functions in a given 3D probabilistic landscape. When integrated over the relevant state space, these entropic surfaces yield values of the respective global entropy. Through analytical and numerical evaluation, it is demonstrated that the differential entropy approaches the quantum collision entropy under certain mixing conditions, which aligns with the Renyi entropy for order $α= 2$. Within the HQC framework, the results establish a theoretical and computational equivalence between these measures. This provides a unified perspective on quantifying uncertainty in hybrid quantum communication systems. Extending the analysis to the operational domain of finite key QKD, we demonstrated that the same $10\\%$ approximation threshold corresponds to an order-of-magnitude change in Eves success probability and a measurable reduction in the secure key rate."}

By integrating visual perception, language understanding, and action planning, they enable general-purpose task execution across diverse environments. Despite their importance, the security of VLA models remains underexplored -- particularly in the context of backdoor attacks, which pose realistic threats in physical-world deployments. While recent methods attempt to inject backdoors into VLA models, these backdoors are easily erased during downstream adaptation, as user-side fine-tuning with clean data significantly alters model parameters, rendering them impractical for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose INFUSE (INjection into Fine-tUne-inSensitive modulEs), the first backdoor attack framework for VLA base models that remains effective even with arbitrary user fine-tuning. INFUSE begins by analyzing parameter sensitivity across diverse fine-tuning scenarios to identify modules that remain largely unchanged -- the fine-tune-insensitive modules. It then injects backdoors into these stable modules while freezing the rest, ensuring malicious behavior persists after extensive user fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VLA architectures demonstrate INFUSE's effectiveness. After user-side fine-tuning, INFUSE maintains mean attack success rates of 91.0% on simulation environments and 79.8% on real-world robot tasks, substantially surpassing BadVLA (38.8% and 36.6%, respectively), while preserving clean-task performance comparable to standard models. These results uncover a critical threat: backdoors implanted before distribution can persist through fine-tuning and remain effective at deployment."}

The denoising ability of the method is achieved via the application of a sparsification operation to both the real and frequency domain representations of the adjacency matrix with algorithm convergence achieved when the real domain sparsity pattern stabilizes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we apply it to noisy versions of several deterministic models including Kautz, lattice, tree and bipartite networks. For contrast, we also evaluate preferential attachment networks to illustrate the behavior on stochastic graphs. We compare the performance of IterativeFT against simple real domain and frequency domain thresholding, reduced rank reconstruction and locally adaptive network sparsification. Relative to the comparison network denoising approaches, the proposed IterativeFT method provides the best overall performance for lattice and Kuatz networks with competitive performance on tree and bipartite networks.

Unlike existing visuo-tactile sensors, LVTG enables more effective and stable grasping of larger and heavier everyday objects, thanks to its enhanced tactile sensing area and greater opening angle. Its surface skin is made of highly wear-resistant material, significantly improving durability and extending operational lifespan. The integration of vision and tactile feedback allows LVTG to provide rich, high-fidelity sensory data, facilitating reliable perception during complex manipulation tasks. Furthermore, LVTG features a modular design that supports rapid maintenance and replacement. To effectively fuse vision and touch, We adopt a CLIP-inspired contrastive learning objective to align tactile embeddings with their corresponding visual observations, enabling a shared cross-modal representation space for visuo-tactile perception. This alignment improves the performance of an Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) policy in contact-rich manipulation, leading to more efficient data collection and more effective policy learning.

This paper presents a data-driven IMF localization framework that directly maps induced magnetic field measurements to spatial coordinates using supervised learning, eliminating explicit environment-specific calibration. By replacing explicit field modeling with learning-based inference, the proposed approach captures nonlinear field interactions and environmental effects. An orientation-invariant feature representation enables rotation-independent deployment. The system is evaluated across multiple indoor environments and an outdoor deployment. Benchmarking against classical and deep learning baselines shows that a Random Forest regressor achieves sub-20 cm accuracy in 2D and sub-30 cm in 3D localization. Cross-environment validation demonstrates that models trained indoors generalize to outdoor environments without retraining. We further analyze scalability by varying transmitter spacing, showing that coverage and accuracy can be balanced through deployment density. Overall, this work demonstrates that data-driven IMF localization is a scalable and transferable solution for real-world positioning."}

This study explores the use of low-power, non-ionizing millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing for through-mask motion detection. We characterize the RF properties of thermoplastic mask material in the 28-38 GHz range and perform motion detection using a 1 GHz bandwidth centered at 28 GHz. We use a frequency-domain system with horn antennas in a custom-built anechoic chamber to capture changes in the amplitude and phase of transmitted RF waves in response to subtle head and facial movements.

Prior work leverages VQ-VAE based frameworks to learn latent actions from human videos in an unsupervised manner. Nevertheless, since the training objective primarily focuses on reconstructing visual appearances rather than capturing inter-frame dynamics, the learned representations tend to rely on spurious visual cues, leading to shortcut learning and entangled latent representations that hinder transferability. To address this, we propose ConLA, an unsupervised pretraining framework for learning robotic policies from human videos. ConLA introduces a contrastive disentanglement mechanism that leverages action category priors and temporal cues to isolate motion dynamics from visual content, effectively mitigating shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that ConLA achieves strong performance across diverse benchmarks. Notably, by pretraining solely on human videos, our method for the first time surpasses the performance obtained with real robot trajectory pretraining, highlighting its ability to extract pure and semantically consistent latent action representations for scalable robot learning."}

Despite this underlying commonality, existing approaches typically adopt specialized model designs, which hinders cross-task generalization and system scalability. More critically, this separation overlooks the potential mutual benefits among tasks. Motivated by these observations, we propose UniMotion, a unified motion framework that captures shared structures across motion tasks while accommodating their individual requirements. Built on a decoder-only Transformer architecture, UniMotion employs dedicated interaction modes and tailored training strategies to simultaneously support these motion tasks. This unified design not only enables joint optimization and representation sharing but also allows for targeted fine-tuning to specialize in individual tasks when needed.

While most existing works focus on improving MIMO-OFDM ISAC performance, the impact of transmit power and radio-frequency (RF) circuit power consumption on energy efficiency (EE) remains relatively underexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates joint precoding and RF chain selection for multi-user MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems, and develops energy-efficient designs for both fully digital and hybrid precoding architectures through the joint optimization of precoding and RF-chain activation. Specifically, we first formulate a novel EE maximization problem subject to sensing performance constraints. Then, efficient optimization algorithms are proposed for both architectures, together with analyses of their computational complexity and convergence behavior. Building on the proposed approaches, spectral efficiency-power consumption tradeoff designs are also provided. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with existing schemes, the proposed approaches achieve significant improvements in the EE-sensing tradeoff for ISAC systems."}

To this aim, Janus (i) decomposes the overall behavior into specialized modules, related to scope detection, intent recognition, memory, inner speech, query generation, and outer speech, and (ii) exposes explicit policies for information sufficiency, execution readiness, and tool grounding. A dedicated memory agent maintains a bounded recent-history buffer, a compact core memory, and an archival store with semantic retrieval, coupled through controlled consolidation and revision policies.

However, the sensing performance is often degraded by model mismatches caused by geometric errors (e.g., position and orientation) and hardware impairments (e.g., mutual coupling and amplifier non-linearity). This paper focuses on the angle estimation performance with antenna arrays and tackles the critical challenge of array beam pattern calibration for ISAC systems. To assess calibration quality from a sensing perspective, a novel performance metric that accounts for angle estimation error, rather than beam pattern similarity, is proposed and incorporated into a differentiable loss function. Additionally, a cooperative calibration framework is introduced, allowing multiple user equipments to iteratively optimize the beam pattern based on the proposed loss functions and local data, and collaboratively update global calibration parameters. The proposed models and algorithms are validated using real-world beam pattern measurements collected in an anechoic chamber. Experimental results show that the angle estimation error can be reduced from {$\\textbf{1.01}^\\circ$} to $\\textbf{0.11}^\\circ$ in 2D calibration scenarios, and from $\\textbf{5.19}^\\circ$ to $\\textbf{0.86}^\\circ$ in 3D calibration ones."}

To address these challenges, we introduce a unified framework encompassing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) locomotion policy for robust multi-terrain representation with RoboGauge, a predictive assessment suite that quantifies sim-to-real transferability. The MoE policy employs a gated set of specialist experts to decompose latent terrain and command modeling, achieving superior deployment robustness and generalization via proprioception alone. RoboGauge further provides multi-dimensional proprioception-based metrics via sim-to-sim tests over terrains, difficulty levels, and domain randomizations, enabling reliable MoE policy selection without extensive physical trials. Experiments on a Unitree Go2 demonstrate robust locomotion on unseen challenging terrains, including snow, sand, stairs, slopes, and 30 cm obstacles. In dedicated high-speed tests, the robot reaches 4 m/s and exhibits an emergent narrow-width gait associated with improved stability at high velocity."}

Although the product of GMMs is still a GMM, as the number of factors increases, the number of components in the resulting product GMM grows exponentially. To obtain a tractable approximation for a univariate factored probability density function (PDF), such as a product of GMMs, we investigate iterative message-passing algorithms. Based on Belief Propagation (BP), we propose a Variable Duplication and Gaussian Belief Propagation (VDBP)-based algorithm. The key idea of VDBP is to construct a multivariate measurement model whose marginal posterior is equal to the given univariate factored PDF. We then apply Gaussian BP (GaBP) to transform the global inference problem into local ones. Expectation propagation (EP) is another branch of message passing algorithms. In addition to converting the global approximation problem into local ones, it features a projection operation that ensures the intermediate functions (messages) belong to a desired family. Due to this projection, EP can be used to approximate the factored PDF directly. However, even if every factor is integrable, the division operation in EP may still cause the algorithm to fail when the mean and variance of a non-integrable belief are required. Therefore, this paper proposes two methods that combine EP with our previously proposed techniques for handling non-integrable beliefs to approximate univariate factored distributions."}

Improving inference efficiency is therefore essential for practical robotic applications. Existing acceleration methods often rely on heuristic or static strategies--such as rule-based token caching or pruning--that are decoupled from task objectives and fail to adapt to dynamic scene changes. In this work, we reformulate inference acceleration as a learnable policy optimization problem and propose a novel framework that integrates a dynamic, task-aware decision-making process directly into the VLA model. At its core are two lightweight, cooperative modules: a Cached Token Selector, which determines which tokens should be reused, and a Cache Ratio Predictor, which controls how many tokens to reuse. Training these modules is non-trivial due to their discrete decisions. We address this by adopting a differentiable relaxation that allows gradient-based end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO and SIMPLER benchmarks, as well as real-robot evaluations, show that our method achieves a 1.76x wall-clock inference speedup while simultaneously improving the average success rate by 1.9 percentage points (from 75.0% to 76.9%) on LIBERO and by 5.0 percentage points on real-world tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

To address this challenge, this paper investigates Lamé curves as a unified representation of common LED shapes and proposes a generic VLP algorithm using Lamé curve-shaped LEDs, termed LC-VLP. In the considered system, multiple ceiling-mounted Lamé curve-shaped LEDs periodically broadcast their curve parameters via visible light communication, which are captured by a camera-equipped receiver. Based on the received LED images and curve parameters, the receiver can estimate the camera pose using LC-VLP. Specifically, an LED database is constructed offline to store the curve parameters, while online positioning is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem and solved iteratively. To provide a reliable initialization, a correspondence-free perspective-\\textit{n}-points (FreeP\\textit{n}P) algorithm is further developed, enabling approximate CPE without any pre-calibrated reference points. The performance of LC-VLP is verified by both simulations and experiments. Simulations show that LC-VLP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both circular- and rectangular-LED scenarios, achieving reductions of over 40% in position error and 25% in rotation error.

In this paper, we establish a unified theoretical performance analysis framework for different RFF feature extraction methods using the silhouette score as an evaluation metric, and propose a precoding-based channel-robust RFF feature extraction method that enhances the silhouette score without requiring channel estimation. First, we employ the silhouette score as an evaluation metric and obtain the theoretical performance of various RFF feature extraction methods using the Taylor series expansion. Next, we mitigate channel effects by computing the reciprocal of the received signal in the frequency domain at the device under authentication. We then compare these methods across three different scenarios: the deterministic channel scenario, the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) stochastic channel scenario, and the non-i.i.d. stochastic channel scenario. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the silhouette score is an efficient metric to evaluate classification accuracy.

Results show modality-specific engagement profiles: display-based interpretive video induced high arousal and fast-band activity, immersive projections promoted calm, presence-oriented absorption, and original artworks reflected internally regulated engagement. These findings, relying on lightweight EEG sensing in an operational cultural environment, suggest that digital interpretive content affects engagement style rather than quantity. This paves the way for new multimodal sensing approaches and enables museums to optimize the modalities and content of their interpretive media."}

For instance, crossing a ditch may be risky at a low speed due to the risk of getting stuck, yet safe at a higher speed with a controlled, accelerated jump. Achieving such behavior requires path planning that explicitly models complex motion dynamics, whereas existing methods often neglect this aspect and plan solely based on positions or a fixed velocity. To address this gap, we introduce Motion-aware Traversability (MAT) representation to explicitly model terrain cost conditioned on actual robot motion. Instead of assigning a single scalar score for traversability, MAT models each terrain region as a Gaussian function of velocity. During online planning, we decompose the terrain cost computation into two stages: (1) predict terrain-dependent Gaussian parameters from perception in a single forward pass, (2) efficiently update terrain costs for new velocities inferred from current dynamics by evaluating these functions without repeated inference. We develop a system that integrates MAT to enable agile off-road navigation and evaluate it in both simulated and real-world environments with various obstacles. Results show that MAT achieves real-time efficiency and enhances the performance of off-road navigation, reducing path detours by 75% while maintaining safety across challenging terrains."}

Among various amodal sensing paradigms, wireless amodal sensing is a potential solution due to its advantages of environmental robustness, privacy preservation, and low cost. However, the sensing data obtained by wireless system is sparse for shape reconstruction because of the low spatial resolution, and this issue is further intensified in complex environments with occlusion. To address this issue, we propose a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless amodal sensing scheme that leverages a large-scale RIS to enhance the spatial resolution and create reflection paths that can bypass the obstacles. A generative learning model is also employed to reconstruct the complete shape based on the sensing data captured from the viewpoint of the RIS. In such a system, it is challenging to optimize the RIS phase shifts because the relationship between RIS phase shifts and amodal sensing accuracy is complex and the closed-form expression is unknown. To tackle this challenge, we develop an error prediction model that learns the mapping from RIS phase shifts to amodal sensing accuracy, and optimizes RIS phase shifts based on this mapping. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset show that our method achieves at least a 56.73% reduction in reconstruction error compared to conventional schemes under the same number of RIS configurations."}

Building on this formulation, we propose RoDiF (Robust Direct Fine-Tuning), a method that explicitly addresses corrupted human preferences. RoDiF reinterprets the DPO objective through a geometric hypothesis-cutting perspective and employs a conservative cutting strategy to achieve robustness without assuming any specific noise distribution. Extensive experiments on long-horizon manipulation tasks show that RoDiF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively steering pretrained diffusion policies of diverse architectures to human-preferred modes, while maintaining strong performance even under 30% corrupted preference labels."}

Specifically, we first propose a discrete mass-distribution function defined over a set of sample points to model swarm formation. In contrast to the continuous density-distribution method, our model eliminates the requirement for defining continuous density functions-a task that is difficult for complex shapes. Second, we design a decentralized meanshift control law to coordinate the swarm's global distribution to fit the sample-point distribution by feeding back mass estimates. The mass estimates for all sample points are achieved by the robots in a decentralized manner via the designed mass estimator. It is shown that the mass estimates of the sample points can asymptotically converge to the true global values. To validate the proposed strategy, we conduct comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments to evaluate the efficiency of complex shape formation and adaptability to swarm-size variations."}

Conventional numerical methods for computing such paths do not scale well to high-dimensional systems, while sampling-based planners trade scalability for geometric fidelity. To bridge this gap, we propose a sampling-based motion planning framework that operates directly on Riemannian manifolds. We introduce a computationally efficient midpoint-based approximation of the Riemannian geodesic distance and prove that it matches the true Riemannian distance with third-order accuracy. Building on this approximation, we design a local planner that traces the manifold using first-order retractions guided by Riemannian natural gradients. Experiments on a two-link planar arm and a 7-DoF Franka manipulator under a kinetic-energy metric, as well as on rigid-body planning in $\\mathrm{SE}(2)$ with non-holonomic motion constraints, demonstrate that our approach consistently produces lower-cost trajectories than Euclidean-based planners and classical numerical geodesic-solver baselines."}

Using computer graphics rendering software to synthesize the often-complicated dependence among parameter(s) of interest and observations, i.e. the forward model, the proposed framework evaluates the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound to establish lower bounds on the variance of any unbiased estimator of the unknown parameters. The effects of inexact rendering of the true forward model on the computed lower bounds are also analyzed, both theoretically and via simulations. Experimental evaluations compare the computed lower bounds with the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator on a canonical object localization problem, showing that the lower bounds computed via the framework proposed here are indicative of the true underlying fundamental limits in several nominally representative scenarios."}

The framework commences with a two-stage, weakly supervised skill discovery process: Stage one performs coarse, task-aware macro-segmentation by employing an alignment-enforced Vector Quantized VAE guided by weak task labels. Stage two then refines these segments at a micro-level using a self-supervised sequential model, followed by an iterative clustering process to consolidate skill boundaries. The third stage then leverages these precise boundaries to construct a hierarchical policy within an option-based framework-complete with a learned termination condition beta for explicit skill switching. LOKI achieves high success rates on the challenging D4RL Kitchen benchmark and outperforms standard HIL baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the discovered skills are semantically meaningful, aligning with human intuition, and exhibit compositionality by successfully sequencing them to solve a novel, unseen task."}

This review article provides a concise mathematical reference for researchers seeking an explicit, equation-level description of LLM training, alignment, and generation. We formulate LLMs as high-dimensional nonlinear autoregressive models with attention-based dependencies. The framework encompasses pretraining via next-token prediction, alignment methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), direct preference optimization (DPO), rejection sampling fine-tuning (RSFT), and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), as well as autoregressive generation during inference. Self-attention emerges naturally as a repeated bilinear--softmax--linear composition, yielding highly expressive sequence models. This formulation enables principled analysis of alignment-induced behaviors (including sycophancy), inference-time phenomena (such as hallucination, in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation), and extensions like continual learning, while serving as a concise reference for interpretation and further theoretical development."}

Conventional learning approaches often struggle to separate task-relevant features from domain-specific variations (e.g., lighting, field-of-view, and rotation), leading to poor sample efficiency and catastrophic failure in unseen environments. To bridge this gap, we propose ContrAstive Prompt Orchestration (CAPO), a novel approach for learning visuomotor policies that integrates contrastive prompt learning and adaptive prompt orchestration. For prompt learning, we devise a hybrid contrastive learning strategy that integrates visual, temporal action, and text objectives to establish a pool of learnable prompts, where each prompt induces a visual representation encapsulating fine-grained domain factors. Based on these learned prompts, we introduce an adaptive prompt orchestration mechanism that dynamically aggregates these prompts conditioned on current observations. This enables the agent to adaptively construct optimal state representations by identifying dominant domain factors instantaneously. Consequently, the policy optimization is effectively shielded from irrelevant interference, preventing the common issue of overfitting to source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Crucially, it exhibits superior zero-shot adaptation across unseen target domains characterized by drastic environmental (e.g., illumination) and physical shifts (e.g., field-of-view and rotation), validating its effectiveness as a viable solution for cross-embodiment visuomotor policy adaptation."}

It also presents the complete workflow, including data preprocessing and comparison of ML models. To understand which ML classification model works best for this kind of problem, we train and test the following three commonly used models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). The performance of each is evaluated with respect to accuracy and F1-score. The results indicate that ML models can be effectively utilized for three-way emotion classification of EEG signals. Among the three ML models trained on the available dataset, the RF model gave the best results. Its higher accuracy and F1-score suggest that it is able to capture the emotional patterns more accurately and effectively than the other two models. The RF model also outperformed the existing state-of-the-art classification models in terms of the accuracy parameter."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for task planning and BT generation. However, most existing approaches remain confined to simulations or simple manipulators, with relatively few applications demonstrated in real-world contexts, such as complex construction sites involving multiple machines.

Packet-based networking enabled the reliable transport of bits; cloud-native systems enabled the orchestration of distributed computation. Today, the emergence of autonomous, learning-based systems introduces a new architectural challenge: intelligence is increasingly embedded directly into network control, computation, and decision-making, yet the Internet lacks a structural foundation for representing and exchanging meaning. In this paper, we argue that cognition alone: pattern recognition, prediction, and optimization, is insufficient for the next generation of networked systems. As autonomous agents act across safety-critical and socio-technical domains, systems must not only compute and communicate, but also comprehend intent, context, and consequence. We introduce the concept of a Semantic Layer: a new architectural stratum that treats meaning as a first-class construct, enabling interpretive alignment, semantic accountability, and intelligible autonomous behavior. We show that this evolution leads naturally to a Syntactic-Semantic Internet. The syntactic stack continues to transport bits, packets, and workloads with speed and reliability, while a parallel semantic stack transports meaning, grounding, and consequence. We describe the structure of this semantic stack-semantic communication, a semantic substrate, and an emerging Agentic Web, and draw explicit architectural parallels to TCP/IP and the World Wide Web. Finally, we examine current industry efforts, identify critical architectural gaps, and outline the engineering challenges required to make semantic interoperability a global, interoperable infrastructure."}

To expand this coverage without costly additional data collection, recent work relies on co-training: jointly learning from target robot data and heterogeneous data modalities. However, how different co-training data modalities and strategies affect policy performance remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale empirical study examining five co-training data modalities: standard vision-language data, dense language annotations for robot trajectories, cross-embodiment robot data, human videos, and discrete robot action tokens across single- and multi-phase training strategies. Our study leverages 4,000 hours of robot and human manipulation data and 50M vision-language samples to train vision-language-action policies. We evaluate 89 policies over 58,000 simulation rollouts and 2,835 real-world rollouts. Our results show that co-training with forms of vision-language and cross-embodiment robot data substantially improves generalization to distribution shifts, unseen tasks, and language following, while discrete action token variants yield no significant benefits. Combining effective modalities produces cumulative gains and enables rapid adaptation to unseen long-horizon dexterous tasks via fine-tuning. Training exclusively on robot data degrades the visiolinguistic understanding of the vision-language model backbone, while co-training with effective modalities restores these capabilities. Explicitly conditioning action generation on chain-of-thought traces learned from co-training data does not improve performance in our simulation benchmark. Together, these results provide practical guidance for building scalable generalist robot policies."}

A novel system architecture is proposed, wherein each base station (BS) antenna transmits a dedicated single-user stream, while a multi-layer SIM executes wave-based beamforming in the electromagnetic domain, thereby avoiding the need for complex baseband digital precoding and significantly reducing hardware overhead. To maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR), we formulate a joint precoding optimization problem over BS power allocation and SIM phase shifts, which is high-dimensional and non-convex due to the complexity of the objective function and the coupling among optimization variables. To address this, we propose a manifold-enhanced heterogeneous multi-agent continual learning (MHACL) framework that incorporates gradient representation and dual-scale policy optimization to achieve robust performance in dynamic environments with high demands for secure communication. Furthermore, we develop SIM-MHACL (SIMHACL), a low-complexity learning template that embeds phase coordination into a product manifold structure, reducing the exponential search space to linear complexity while maintaining physical feasibility.

In many robot-wire interaction tasks, contact occurs not at the end-effector but at other points along the robot's body. Such scenarios arise when robots manipulate wires indirectly (e.g., by nudging) or when wires act as passive obstacles in the environment. Accurately identifying these interactions is crucial for safe and efficient trajectory planning, helping to prevent wire damage, avoid restricted robot motions, and mitigate potential hazards. Existing approaches often rely on expensive external force-torque sensor or that contacts occur at the end-effector for accurate force estimation. Using wire shape information acquired from a depth camera and under the assumption that the wire is in or near its static equilibrium, our method estimates both the location and magnitude of external forces without additional prior knowledge. This is achieved by exploiting derived consistency conditions and solving a system of linear equations based on force-torque balance along the wire. The approach was validated through simulation, where it achieved high accuracy, and through real-world experiments, where accurate estimation was demonstrated in selected interaction scenarios."}

The framework is trained entirely from heterogeneous offline teleoperation data containing both successful and failed executions. Task feasibility is mod-eled as a conservative success score learned via Conservative Value Learning, yielding a risk-sensitive estimate that remains reliable under distribution shift. During online operation, the learned success score regulates the level of assistance, while a learned actor provides a corrective motion direction. Both are integrated through a joint-space impedance interface on the master side, yielding continuous guidance that steers the operator away from failure-prone actions without overriding intent. Experimental results on contact-rich manipulation tasks demonstrate improved task success rates and reduced operator workload compared to conventional teleoperation and shared-autonomy baselines, indicating that conservative value learning provides an effective mechanism for embedding failure awareness into bilateral teleoperation.

To address this, we present StreamVLA, a dual-system architecture that unifies textual task decomposition, visual goal imagination, and continuous action generation within a single parameter-efficient backbone. We introduce a \"Lock-and-Gated\" mechanism to intelligently modulate computation: only when a sub-task transition is detected, the model triggers slow thinking to generate a textual instruction and imagines the specific visual completion state, rather than generic future frames. Crucially, this completion state serves as a time-invariant goal anchor, making the policy robust to execution speed variations. During steady execution, these high-level intents are locked to condition a Flow Matching action head, allowing the model to bypass expensive autoregressive decoding for 72% of timesteps. This hierarchical abstraction ensures sub-goal focus while significantly reducing inference latency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that StreamVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 98.5% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark and robust recovery in real-world interference scenarios, achieving a 48% reduction in latency compared to full-reasoning baselines."}

A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \\emph{AgeTop-\\(k\\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \\(k\\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected. This ensures that all selected parameters fit into a single OFDM symbol, reducing latency.

Revisiting the foundational principles of active perception, we introduce an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework in which a robot must not only reach a goal while avoiding obstacles, but also actively control its onboard camera to enhance situational awareness. The policy receives observations comprising the robot state, the current depth frame, and a particularly local geometry representation built from a short history of depth readings. To couple collision-free motion planning with information-driven active camera control, we augment the navigation reward with a voxel-based information metric. This enables an aerial robot to learn a robust policy that balances goal-directed motion with exploratory sensing. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our strategy achieves safer flight compared to using fixed, non-actuated camera baselines while also inducing intrinsic exploratory behaviors."}

However, existing designs primarily focus on dual-mode platforms, and some designs suffer from high mechanical complexity or low propulsion efficiency, which limits their application. In this paper, we propose a novel triphibious robot capable of aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic motion, by a minimalist design combining a quadcopter structure with two passive wheels, without extra actuators. To address inefficiency of ground-support motion (moving on land/seabed) for quadcopter based designs, we introduce an eccentric Center of Gravity (CoG) design that inherently aligns thrust with motion, enhancing efficiency without specialized mechanical transformation designs. Furthermore, to address the drastic differences in motion control caused by different fluids (air and water), we develop a unified propulsion system based on Field-Oriented Control (FOC). This method resolves torque matching issues and enables precise, rapid bidirectional thrust across different mediums. Grounded in the perspective of living condition and ground support, we analyse the robot's dynamics and propose a Hybrid Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (HNMPC)-PID control system to ensure stable multi-domain motion and seamless transitions. Experimental results validate the robot's multi-domain motion and cross-mode transition capability, along with the efficiency and adaptability of the proposed propulsion system."}

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge by adapting the network to the robot's target environment without external supervision, leveraging the large amounts of data a robot might naturally collect during long-term operation. In such settings, UDA methods can exploit multi-view consistency across the environment's map to fine-tune the model in an unsupervised fashion and mitigate domain shift. However, these approaches remain sensitive to cross-view instance-level inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a method that starts from a volumetric 3D map to generate multi-view consistent pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels using the zero-shot instance segmentation capabilities of a foundation model, enforcing instance-level coherence. The refined annotations serve as supervision for self-supervised fine-tuning, enabling the robot to adapt its perception system at deployment time. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance over state-of-the-art UDA baselines based on multi-view consistency, without requiring any ground-truth labels in the target domain."}

We developed various arms for this ring mechanism with varying flexibilities to improve adaptability when applied to non-extremities of the body (abdomen, back, neck, etc.). To apply equal and constant pressure across the wound, we developed an inflatable ring and airbag balloon that are compatible with this shape-changing ring mechanism. A series of experiments focused on evaluating various ring arm configurations to characterize their bending stiffness. Subsequent experiments measured the force exerted by the airbag balloon system using a digital scale. Despite its promising performance, certain limitations related to coverage area are identified. The shape-changing effect of the device is limited to scenarios involving partially inflated or deflated airbag balloons, and cannot fully conform to complex anatomical regions. Finally, the device was tested on casualty simulation kits, where it successfully demonstrated its ability to control simulated bleeding."}

To address these challenges, we propose TreeLoc, a LiDAR-based global localization framework for forests that handles place recognition and 6-DoF pose estimation. We represent scenes using tree stems and their Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), which are aligned to a common reference frame via their axes and summarized using the tree distribution histogram (TDH) for coarse matching, followed by fine matching with a 2D triangle descriptor. Finally, pose estimation is achieved through a two-step geometric verification. On diverse forest benchmarks, TreeLoc outperforms baselines, achieving precise localization. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. We also propose applications for long-term forest management using descriptors from a compact global tree database.

Although anomaly detection can mitigate these failures, prior methods are often incompatible with high-rate control, poorly calibrated at the extremely low false-positive rates required for practical deployment, or operate as black boxes that provide a binary stop signal without explaining why the robot drifted from nominal behavior. We present RAPT, a lightweight, self-supervised deployment-time monitor for 50Hz humanoid control. RAPT learns a probabilistic spatio-temporal manifold of nominal execution from simulation and evaluates execution-time predictive deviation as a calibrated, per-dimension signal. This yields (i) reliable online OOD detection under strict false-positive constraints and (ii) a continuous, interpretable measure of Sim-to-Real mismatch that can be tracked over time to quantify how far deployment has drifted from training. Beyond detection, we introduce an automated post-hoc root-cause analysis pipeline that combines gradient-based temporal saliency derived from RAPT's reconstruction objective with LLM-based reasoning conditioned on saliency and joint kinematics to produce semantic failure diagnoses in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate RAPT on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four complex tasks in simulation and on physical hardware. In large-scale simulation, RAPT improves True Positive Rate (TPR) by 37% over the strongest baseline at a fixed episode-level false positive rate of 0.5%. On real-world deployments, RAPT achieves a 12.5% TPR improvement and provides actionable interpretability, reaching 75% root-cause classification accuracy across 16 real-world failures using only proprioceptive data."}

For example, Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations are often confined to single-wheel tests, which obscures coupled wheel-vehicle-controller interactions and prevents joint optimization of mechanical design and control. This paper presents a Bayesian optimization framework that co-designs rover wheel geometry and steering controller parameters using high-fidelity, full-vehicle closed-loop simulations on deformable terrain. Using the efficiency and scalability of a continuum-representation model (CRM) for terramechanics, we evaluate candidate designs on trajectories of varying complexity while towing a fixed load. The optimizer tunes wheel parameters (radius, width, and grouser features) and steering PID gains under a multi-objective formulation that balances traversal speed, tracking error, and energy consumption. We compare two strategies: simultaneous co-optimization of wheel and controller parameters versus a sequential approach that decouples mechanical and control design. We analyze trade-offs in performance and computational cost. Across 3,000 full-vehicle simulations, campaigns finish in five to nine days, versus months with the group's earlier DEM-based workflow. Finally, a preliminary hardware study suggests the simulation-optimized wheel designs preserve relative performance trends on the physical rover. Together, these results show that scalable, high-fidelity simulation can enable practical co-optimization of wheel design and control for off-road vehicles on deformable terrain without relying on prohibitively expensive DEM studies.

This is due to optimizing to match robot end-effector to human hand position and orientation, which can also limit the robot's workspace to that of the human. Instead, this paper reframes retargeting as an orientation alignment problem, enabling a closed-form, geometric solution algorithm with an optimality guarantee. The key idea is to align a robot arm to a human's upper and lower arm orientations, as identified from shoulder, elbow, and wrist (SEW) keypoints; hence, the method is called SEW-Mimic. The method has fast inference (3 kHz) on standard commercial CPUs, leaving computational overhead for downstream applications; an example in this paper is a safety filter to avoid bimanual self-collision. The method suits most 7-degree-of-freedom robot arms and humanoids, and is agnostic to input keypoint source. Experiments show that SEW-Mimic outperforms other retargeting methods in computation time and accuracy. A pilot user study suggests that the method improves teleoperation task success. Preliminary analysis indicates that data collected with SEW-Mimic improves policy learning due to being smoother. SEW-Mimic is also shown to be a drop-in way to accelerate full-body humanoid retargeting. Finally, hardware demonstrations illustrate SEW-Mimic's practicality. The results emphasize the utility of SEW-Mimic as a fundamental building block for bimanual robot manipulation and humanoid robot teleoperation."}

A custom dataset comprising 31 surgical instruments and 6,975 annotated images was collected to train a hybrid perception pipeline using YOLO12 for detection and a cascaded ResNet-based model for fine-grained classification.

A key limitation of existing approaches is that task reasoning is implicitly embedded in high-dimensional latent representations, making it challenging to separate task structure from perceptual variability. We introduce Grounded Scene-graph Reasoning (GSR), a structured reasoning paradigm that explicitly models world-state evolution as transitions over semantically grounded scene graphs. By reasoning step-wise over object states and spatial relations, rather than directly mapping perception to actions, GSR enables explicit reasoning about action preconditions, consequences, and goal satisfaction in a physically grounded space. To support learning such reasoning, we construct Manip-Cognition-1.6M, a large-scale dataset that jointly supervises world understanding, action planning, and goal interpretation. Extensive evaluations across RLBench, LIBERO, GSR-benchmark, and real-world robotic tasks show that GSR significantly improves zero-shot generalization and long-horizon task completion over prompting-based baselines.

Instead of enforcing a fixed reference at either the front or rear axle, the proposed method continuously interpolates between both, enabling smooth adaptation across driving contexts, including low-speed maneuvers and reverse motion. The lateral steering command is obtained by barycentric blending of two complementary controllers: a front-axle Stanley formulation and a rear-axle curvature-based geometric controller, yielding continuous transitions in steering behavior and improved tracking stability. In addition, we introduce a curvature-aware longitudinal control strategy based on virtual track borders and ray-tracing, which converts upcoming geometric constraints into a virtual obstacle distance and regulates speed accordingly. The complete approach is implemented in a unified control stack and validated in simulation and on a real autonomous vehicle equipped with GPS-RTK, radar, odometry, and IMU. The results in closed-loop tracking and backward maneuvers show improved trajectory accuracy, smoother steering profiles, and increased adaptability compared to fixed control-point baselines."}

Although recent frameworks such as RIFT have partially addressed these issues through group-relative optimization, their forward simulation procedures remain largely non-reactive, leading to unrealistic agent interactions within the virtual domain and ultimately limiting simulation fidelity. To address these issues, we propose ForSim, a stepwise closed-loop forward simulation paradigm. At each virtual timestep, the traffic agent propagates the virtual candidate trajectory that best spatiotemporally matches the reference trajectory through physically grounded motion dynamics, thereby preserving multimodal behavioral diversity while ensuring intra-modality consistency. Other agents are updated with stepwise predictions, yielding coherent and interaction-aware evolution. When incorporated into the RIFT traffic simulation framework, ForSim operates in conjunction with group-relative optimization to fine-tune traffic policy. Extensive experiments confirm that this integration consistently improves safety while maintaining efficiency, realism, and comfort. These results underscore the importance of modeling closed-loop multimodal interactions within forward simulation and enhance the fidelity and reliability of traffic simulation for autonomous driving.

The proposed problem is about actively collecting information to complete challenging manipulation tasks that require exploration or focus. As an initial attempt to address this problem, we establish the EFM-10 benchmark that consists of 4 categories of tasks that align with our definition (10 tasks in total). We further come up with a Bimanual Active Perception (BAP) strategy, which leverages one arm to provide active vision and another arm to provide force sensing while manipulating.

To solve this, we propose a novel control architecture that incorporates the macro manipulator into the active interaction control. This leads to a increase in control bandwidth by a factor of 2.1 compared to the state of the art architecture, based on the leader-follower approach and factor 12.5 compared to traditional robot-based force control.

With the rise of edge devices capable of deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) for real-time inference, it stands to reason to use artificial intelligence (AI) for the extraction of object-specific, semantic information from raw image data, such as the object class and the relative six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) pose. However, fusing such AI-based measurements in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) requires quantifying the DNNs' uncertainty and outlier rejection capabilities.\n  This paper presents the benefits of reformulating the measurement equation in AI-based, object-relative state estimation. By deriving an EKF using the direct object-relative pose measurement, we can decouple the position and rotation measurements, thus limiting the influence of erroneous rotation measurements and allowing partial measurement rejection.

During the collision detection phase, contact points are localized with particle-centric geometric primitives; during the contact resolution phase, we cast frictional contact as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP) over contact impulses and solve it with an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) scheme. Crucially, the formulation reuses the same implicit MPM linearization, yielding efficiency and numerical stability. The method integrates seamlessly into the implicit MPM loop and is agnostic to modeling choices, including material laws, interpolation functions, and transfer schemes. We evaluate it across seven representative scenes that span elastic and elasto-plastic responses, simple and complex deformable geometries, and a wide range of contact conditions. Overall, the proposed method enables accurate contact localization, reliable frictional handling, and broad generality, making it a practical solution for MPM-based simulations in robotics and related domains."}

We present Force-Distilled VLA (FD-VLA), a novel framework that integrates force awareness into contact-rich manipulation without relying on physical force sensors. The core of our approach is a Force Distillation Module (FDM), which distills force by mapping a learnable query token, conditioned on visual observations and robot states, into a predicted force token aligned with the latent representation of actual force signals. During inference, this distilled force token is injected into the pretrained VLM, enabling force-aware reasoning while preserving the integrity of its vision-language semantics. This design provides two key benefits: first, it allows practical deployment across a wide range of robots that lack expensive or fragile force-torque sensors, thereby reducing hardware cost and complexity; second, the FDM introduces an additional force-vision-state fusion prior to the VLM, which improves cross-modal alignment and enhances perception-action robustness in contact-rich scenarios. Surprisingly, our physical experiments show that the distilled force token outperforms direct sensor force measurements as well as other baselines, which highlights the effectiveness of this force-distilled VLA approach."}

However, reducing amputee metabolic cost of walking remains an open problem. The Law of Intersegmental Coordination (ISC) has been observed across gaits and has been previously implicated in energy expenditure of walking, yet it has rarely been analyzed or applied within the context of lower-limb amputee gait. This law states that the elevation angles of the thigh, shank and foot over the gait cycle are not independent. In this work, we developed a method to analyze intersegmental coordination for lower-limb 3D kinematic data, to simplify ISC analysis. Moreover, inspired by motor control, biomechanics and robotics literature, we used our method to broaden ISC toward a new law of coordination of moments. We find these Elevation Space Moments (ESM), and present results showing a moment-based coordination for able bodied gait. We also analyzed ISC for amputee gait walking with powered and passive prosthesis, and found that while elevation angles remained planar, the ESM showed less coordination. We use ISC as a constraint to predict the shank angles/moments that would compensate for alterations due to a passive foot so as to mimic a healthy thigh angle/moment profile. This may have implications for improving powered prosthetic control. We developed the ISC3d toolbox that is freely available online, which may be used to compute kinematic and kinetic ISC in 3D. This provides a means to further study the role of coordination in gait and may help address fundamental questions of the neural control of human movement."}

To address this, we introduce PRISM, a single-pass policy based on a batch-global rejection-sampling variant of IMLE. PRISM couples a temporal multisensory encoder (integrating RGB, depth, tactile, audio, and proprioception) with a linear-attention generator using a Performer architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of PRISM on a diverse real-world hardware suite, including loco-manipulation using a Unitree Go2 with a 7-DoF arm D1 and tabletop manipulation with a UR5 manipulator. Across challenging physical tasks such as pre-manipulation parking, high-precision insertion, and multi-object pick-and-place, PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies by 10-25% in success rate while maintaining high-frequency (30-50 Hz) closed-loop control. We further validate our approach on large-scale simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, MetaWorld, and Robomimic. In CALVIN (10% data split), PRISM improves success rates by approximately 25% over diffusion and approximately 20% over flow matching, while simultaneously reducing trajectory jerk by 20x-50x. These results position PRISM as a fast, accurate, and multisensory imitation policy that retains multimodal action coverage without the latency of iterative sampling."}

This paper introduces Centralized, Asynchronous, Multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (CAM-MCTS), a novel framework for general-purpose makespan-efficient object rearrangement planning in challenging environments. CAM-MCTS combines centralized task assignment-where agents remain aware of each other's intended actions to facilitate globally optimized planning-with an asynchronous task execution strategy that enables agents to take on new tasks at appropriate time steps, rather than waiting for others, guided by a one-step look-ahead cost estimate. This design minimizes idle time, prevents unnecessary synchronization delays, and enhances overall system efficiency. We evaluate CAM-MCTS across a diverse set of monotone and non-monotone tasks in cluttered environments, demonstrating consistent reductions in makespan compared to strong baselines.

The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household."}

A deep fusion network for multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction, termed the Multi-Modal Deep Fusion Framework, is designed. The overall architecture consists of two modality-specific feature extraction networks and a bidirectional cross-attention fusion module, aiming to fully exploit the complementary information of LiDAR and radar point clouds in spatial geometric structure and dynamic reflection characteristics. In the feature extraction stage, the model employs independent but structurally identical feature encoders for LiDAR and radar.

To address these issues, a framework named SDCM is proposed, which contains Simulated Densifying and Compensatory Modeling Fusion for radar-vision 3-D object detection in IoV. Firstly, considering point generation based on Gaussian simulation of key points obtained from 3-D Kernel Density Estimation (3-D KDE), and outline generation based on curvature simulation, Simulated Densifying (SimDen) module is designed to generate dense radar point clouds. Secondly, considering that radar data could provide more real time information than vision data, due to the all-weather property of 4-D radar. Radar Compensatory Mapping (RCM) module is designed to reduce the affects of vision datas' representation degradation.

Despite the increase in firmware size, many embedded devices, such as robotic vehicles (RVs), operate in distinct modes, each requiring only a small subset of the firmware code at runtime. We refer to such devices as mode-based embedded devices. Debloating is an approach to reduce attack surfaces by removing or restricting unneeded code, but existing techniques suffer from significant limitations, such as coarse granularity and irreversible code removal, limiting their applicability.\n  To address these limitations, we propose RVDebloater, a novel adaptive debloating technique for mode-based embedded devices that automatically identifies unneeded firmware code for each mode using either static or dynamic analysis, and dynamically debloats the firmware for each mode at the function level at runtime. RVDebloater introduces a new software-based enforcement approach that supports diverse mode-based embedded devices. We implemented RVDebloater using the LLVM compiler and evaluated its efficiency and effectiveness on six different RVs, including both simulated and real ones, with different real-world missions. We find that device requirements change throughout its lifetime for each mode, and that many critical firmware functions can be restricted in other modes, with an average of 85% of functions not being required. The results showed that none of the missions failed after debloating with RVDebloater, indicating that it neither incurred false positives nor false negatives. Further, RVDebloater prunes the firmware call graph by an average of 45% across different firmware. Finally, RVDebloater incurred an average performance overhead of 3.9% and memory overhead of 4% (approximately 0.25 MB) on real RVs."}

We approach this issue by leveraging human flexible reasoning and situational recognition capabilities. Specifically, we design a semi-autonomous system that leaves identification of regions that need more images and navigation of the drones to such regions to a human operator. To this end, we first present a way to reflect the human intention in autonomous coverage control. Subsequently, in order to avoid operational conflicts between manual control and autonomous coverage control, we develop the stealthy coverage control that decouples the drone motion for efficient image sampling from navigation by the human.

Standard PPO relies on surrogate objectives defined via importance ratios, which require evaluating policy likelihood that is typically straightforward when the policy is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. However, extending PPO to more expressive, high-capacity policy models such as continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), also known as flow-matching models, is challenging because likelihood evaluation along the full flow trajectory is computationally expensive and often numerically unstable. To resolve this issue, we propose PolicyFlow, a novel on-policy CNF-based reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates expressive CNF policies with PPO-style objectives without requiring likelihood evaluation along the full flow path. PolicyFlow approximates importance ratios using velocity field variations along a simple interpolation path, reducing computational overhead without compromising training stability. To further prevent mode collapse and further encourage diverse behaviors, we propose the Brownian Regularizer, an implicit policy entropy regularizer inspired by Brownian motion, which is conceptually elegant and computationally lightweight. Experiments on diverse tasks across various environments including MultiGoal, PointMaze, IsaacLab and MuJoCo Playground show that PolicyFlow achieves competitive or superior performance compared to PPO using Gaussian policies and flow-based baselines including FPO and DPPO.

While existing literature extensively addresses physical occlusions caused by scene geometry, a critical mode remains largely unexplored: image corruptions. These sensor-level artifacts, ranging from electronic noise and dead pixels to lens contaminants, directly compromise the integrity of the visual signal prior to interpretation. In this work, we quantify this vulnerability, demonstrating that state-of-the-art VLAs such as $π_{0.5}$ and SmolVLA, suffer catastrophic performance degradation, dropping from 90\\% success rates to as low as 2\\%, under common signal artifacts. To mitigate this, we introduce the Corruption Restoration Transformer (CRT), a plug-and-play and model-agnostic vision transformer designed to immunize VLA models against sensor disturbances. Leveraging an adversarial training objective, CRT restores clean observations from corrupted inputs without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning of the underlying model. Extensive experiments across the LIBERO and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that CRT effectively recovers lost performance, enabling VLAs to maintain near-baseline success rates, even under severe visual corruption."}

We leverage the fact that relative depth preserves global layout and boundaries: by calibrating it with sparse range measurements, we transform it into a pseudo metric depth prior. Building on this prior, we design a refinement network that follows the prior where reliable and deviates where necessary, enabling accurate metric predictions from very few labeled samples. The resulting system is particularly effective when curated validation data are unavailable, sustaining stable scale and sharp edges across few-shot regimes. These findings suggest that coupling foundation priors with sparse anchors is a practical route to robust, deployment-ready depth completion under real-world label scarcity."}

While game theory provides a principled framework for such interactions, existing solvers struggle to handle mixed information structures that combine simultaneous (Nash) and hierarchical (Stackelberg) decision-making. We study N-robot forest-structured mixed-hierarchy games, in which each robot acts as a Stackelberg leader over its subtree while robots in different branches interact via Nash equilibria. We derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) first-order optimality conditions for this class of games and show that they involve increasingly high-order derivatives of robots' best-response policies as the hierarchy depth grows, rendering a direct solution intractable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a quasi-policy approximation that removes higher-order policy derivatives and develop an inexact Newton method for efficiently solving the resulting approximated KKT systems. We prove local exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm for games with non-quadratic objectives and nonlinear constraints. The approach is implemented in a highly optimized Julia library (MixedHierarchyGames.jl) and evaluated in simulated experiments, demonstrating real-time convergence for complex mixed-hierarchy information structures."}

Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a distribution-free framework for this task, yet its standard formulations rely on exchangeability assumptions that are violated by the distribution shifts inherent in real-world robotics. Existing online CP methods maintain target coverage by adaptively scaling the conformal threshold, but typically employ a static nonconformity score function. We show that this fixed geometry leads to highly conservative, volume-inefficient prediction regions when environments undergo structural shifts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{AdaptNC}, a framework for the joint online adaptation of both the nonconformity score parameters and the conformal threshold. AdaptNC leverages an adaptive reweighting scheme to optimize score functions, and introduces a replay buffer mechanism to mitigate the coverage instability that occurs during score transitions. We evaluate AdaptNC on diverse robotic benchmarks involving multi-agent policy changes, environmental changes and sensor degradation. Our results demonstrate that AdaptNC significantly reduces prediction region volume compared to state-of-the-art threshold-only baselines while maintaining target coverage levels."}

Survey paper on spatial AI agents, embodied AI, graph neural networks, and world models", "summary": "While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence."}

Classic bag-of-words approaches such as DBoW are efficient but often degrade under appearance change and perceptual aliasing. In parallel, deep learning-based visual place recognition (VPR) descriptors (e.g., NetVLAD and Transformer-based models) offer stronger robustness, but their computational cost is often viewed as a barrier to real-time SLAM. In this paper, we empirically evaluate NetVLAD as an LCD module and compare it against DBoW on the KITTI dataset. We introduce a Fine-Grained Top-K precision-recall curve that better reflects LCD settings where a query may have zero or multiple valid matches. With Faiss-accelerated nearestneighbor search, NetVLAD achieves real-time query speed while improving accuracy and robustness over DBoW, making it a practical drop-in alternative for LCD in SLAM."}

However, the substantial computational overhead of existing dense Transformerbased models significantly hinders real-time deployment. To address this efficiency-performance bottleneck, we introduce DDP-WM, a novel world model centered on the principle of Disentangled Dynamics Prediction (DDP). We hypothesize that latent state evolution in observed scenes is heterogeneous and can be decomposed into sparse primary dynamics driven by physical interactions and secondary context-driven background updates. DDP-WM realizes this decomposition through an architecture that integrates efficient historical processing with dynamic localization to isolate primary dynamics. By employing a crossattention mechanism for background updates, the framework optimizes resource allocation and provides a smooth optimization landscape for planners. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDP-WM achieves significant efficiency and performance across diverse tasks, including navigation, precise tabletop manipulation, and complex deformable or multi-body interactions. Specifically, on the challenging Push-T task, DDP-WM achieves an approximately 9 times inference speedup and improves the MPC success rate from 90% to98% compared to state-of-the-art dense models. The results establish a promising path for developing efficient, high-fidelity world models. Codes will be available at https://github.com/HCPLabSYSU/DDP-WM."}

We present a camera-free 2D LiDAR object detection pipeline that encodes short-term temporal context by stacking three consecutive scans as RGB channels, yielding a compact YOLOv8n input without occupancy-grid construction while preserving angular structure and motion cues. Evaluated in Webots across 160 randomized indoor scenarios with strict scenario-level holdout, the method achieves 98.4% mAP@0.5 (0.778 mAP@0.5:0.95) with 94.9% precision and 94.7% recall on four object classes. On a Raspberry Pi 5, it runs in real time with a mean post-warm-up end-to-end latency of 47.8ms per frame, including scan encoding and postprocessing. Relative to a closely related occupancy-grid LiDAR-YOLO pipeline reported on the same platform, the proposed representation is associated with substantially lower reported end-to-end latency. Although results are simulation-based, they suggest that lightweight temporal encoding can enable accurate and real-time LiDAR-only detection for embedded indoor robotics without capturing RGB appearance."}

We introduce HieraNav, a multi-granularity, open-vocabulary goal navigation task where agents interpret natural language instructions to reach targets at four semantic levels: scene, room, region, and instance. To this end, we present Language as a Map (LangMap), a large-scale benchmark built on real-world 3D indoor scans with comprehensive human-verified annotations and tasks spanning these levels. LangMap provides region labels, discriminative region descriptions, discriminative instance descriptions covering 414 object categories, and over 18K navigation tasks. Each target features both concise and detailed descriptions, enabling evaluation across different instruction styles. LangMap achieves superior annotation quality, outperforming GOAT-Bench by 23.8% in discriminative accuracy using four times fewer words. Comprehensive evaluations of zero-shot and supervised models on LangMap reveal that richer context and memory improve success, while long-tailed, small, context-dependent, and distant goals, as well as multi-goal completion, remain challenging.

As such, they need to be tested thoroughly. Unfortunately, robot software is intrinsically hard to test compared to traditional software, mainly since the software needs to closely interact with hardware, account for uncertainty in its operational environment, handle disturbances, and act highly autonomously. However, given the large space in which robots operate, anticipating possible failures when designing tests is challenging. This paper presents a mapping study by considering robotics testing papers and relating them to the software testing theory. We consider 247 robotics testing papers and map them to software testing, discussing the state-of-the-art software testing in robotics with an illustrated example, and discuss current challenges. Forming the basis to introduce both the robotics and software engineering communities to software testing challenges. Finally, we identify open questions and lessons learned."}
