### [1] [Quantifying Data Requirements for EEG Independent Component Analysis Using AMICA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10156)
*Gwenevere Frank,Seyed Yahya Shirazi,Jason Palmer,Gert Cauwenberghs,Scott Makeig,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了EEG处理中数据量与通道数对ICA分解质量的影响，发现增加数据量可持续提升分解质量，未观察到明确的平台期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在了解数据量与通道数的比例对ICA分解质量的影响，超越常见启发式阈值，优化EEG数据收集实践。

Method: 使用AMICA算法对71通道数据集进行分解，随机子采样以模拟不同数据量与通道数比例，并通过互信息减少（MIR）和近偶极性评估质量。

Result: 数据量增加时，MIR呈渐近增长趋势，近偶极性普遍提升，但未发现明确的平台期，表明增加数据可能持续改善分解质量。

Conclusion: EEG数据收集的效益可能超出常见启发式阈值，建议在实践中考虑数据量的持续增加以提升ICA分解质量。

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an important step in EEG processing
for a wide-ranging set of applications. However, ICA requires well-designed
studies and data collection practices to yield optimal results. Past studies
have focused on quantitative evaluation of the differences in quality produced
by different ICA algorithms as well as different configurations of parameters
for AMICA, a multimodal ICA algorithm that is considered the benchmark against
which other algorithms are measured. Here, the effect of the data quantity
versus the number of channels on decomposition quality is explored. AMICA
decompositions were run on a 71 channel dataset with 13 subjects while randomly
subsampling data to correspond to specific ratios of the number of frames in a
dataset to the channel count. Decomposition quality was evaluated for the
varying quantities of data using measures of mutual information reduction (MIR)
and the near dipolarity of components. We also note that an asymptotic trend
can be seen in the increase of MIR and a general increasing trend in near
dipolarity with increasing data, but no definitive plateau in these metrics was
observed, suggesting that the benefits of collecting additional EEG data may
extend beyond common heuristic thresholds and continue to enhance decomposition
quality.

### [2] [Intelligent Travel Activity Monitoring: Generalized Distributed Acoustic Sensing Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10237)
*Ruikang Zhong,Chia-Yen Chiang,Mona Jaber,Rupert De Wilde,Peter Hayward*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的分布式声学传感系统，用于监测主动出行活动，具备高精度、经济性和隐私保护，并通过实验验证了其通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是提供一种通用的传感解决方案，以准确、经济且保护隐私的方式监测主动出行活动，并适应不同的气候环境和部署条件。

Method: 利用分布式声学传感捕捉环境振动，通过深度学习推断运动模式；提出两种方案应对异构部署环境：基于联邦学习的物联网方案和基于元学习的离线初始化方法。

Result: 实验结果展示了系统在行走和骑行分类问题中的性能和通用性，为大规模DAS监测主动出行奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该深度学习增强的DAS系统为可持续交通系统的监测提供了一种实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Obtaining data on active travel activities such as walking, jogging, and
cycling is important for refining sustainable transportation systems (STS).
Effectively monitoring these activities not only requires sensing solutions to
have a joint feature of being accurate, economical, and privacy-preserving, but
also enough generalizability to adapt to different climate environments and
deployment conditions. In order to provide a generalized sensing solution, a
deep learning (DL)-enhanced distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system for
monitoring active travel activities is proposed. By leveraging the ambient
vibrations captured by DAS, this scheme infers motion patterns without relying
on image-based or wearable devices, thereby addressing privacy concerns. We
conduct real-world experiments in two geographically distinct locations and
collect comprehensive datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed
system. To address the generalization challenges posed by heterogeneous
deployment environments, we propose two solutions according to network
availability: 1) an Internet-of-Things (IoT) scheme based on federated learning
(FL) is proposed, and it enables geographically different DAS nodes to be
trained collaboratively to improve generalizability; 2) an off-line
initialization approach enabled by meta-learning is proposed to develop
high-generality initialization for DL models and to enable rapid model
fine-tuning with limited data samples, facilitating generalization at newly
established or isolated DAS nodes. Experimental results of the walking and
cycling classification problem demonstrate the performance and generalizability
of the proposed DL-enhanced DAS system, paving the way for practical,
large-scale DAS monitoring of active travel.

### [3] [Ground Reaction Force Estimation via Time-aware Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10265)
*Eun Som Jeon,Sinjini Mitra,Jisoo Lee,Omik M. Save,Ankita Shukla,Hyunglae Lee,Pavan Turaga*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间感知知识蒸馏的框架，用于从鞋垫传感器数据中估计地面反作用力（GRF），显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的GRF测量方法（如跑步机）成本高且不便携，而低成本鞋垫传感器数据易受噪声干扰且精度较低。为解决这些问题，提出了一种新框架。

Method: 采用时间感知知识蒸馏框架，利用小批量数据中的相似性和时序特征，捕获特征间的互补关系和数据的序列特性。

Result: 实验证明，该框架的轻量级模型在GRF估计上的表现优于现有方法，与跑步机测量结果更接近。

Conclusion: 时间感知知识蒸馏框架显著提升了从鞋垫传感器数据中估计GRF的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

### [4] [Heterogeneous-IRS-Assisted MIMO Systems: Channel Estimation and Beamforming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10350)
*Weibiao Zhao,Qiucen Wu,Yuanqi Tang,Yu Zhu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: HE-IRS结构结合动态和静态可调元件，提出了一种新的信道估计和波束成形方法，降低了功耗和导频开销，同时保持了高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IRS功耗高，HE-IRS通过整合动态和静态元件，平衡性能和功耗，但带来了信道估计和波束成形的新挑战。

Method: 分解HE-IRS信道为动态和静态部分，利用稀疏性和流形优化提出高效信道估计方案，并开发鲁棒秩选择规则和波束成形算法。

Result: HE-IRS减少了导频开销和功耗，同时保持了与传统IRS竞争的和速率性能。

Conclusion: HE-IRS是一种绿色解决方案，通过新方法在性能和功耗之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has gained great attention for its
ability to create favorable propagation environments. However, the power
consumption of conventional IRSs cannot be ignored due to the large number of
reflecting elements and control circuits. To balance performance and power
consumption, we previously proposed a heterogeneous-IRS (HE-IRS), a green IRS
structure integrating dynamically tunable elements (DTEs) and statically
tunable elements (STEs). Compared to conventional IRSs with only DTEs, the
unique DTE-STE integrated structure introduces new challenges in both channel
estimation and beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the channel
estimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel
estimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated
is decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent
channel. Leveraging it along with the inherent sparsity of DTE- and STE-based
channels and manifold optimization, we propose an efficient channel estimation
scheme. To address the rank mismatch problem in the imperfect channel sparsity
information, a robust rank selection rule is developed. For beamforming, we
propose an offline algorithm to optimize the STE phase shifts for wide beam
coverage, and an online algorithm to optimize the BS precoder and the DTE phase
shifts using the estimated HE-IRS channel. Simulation results show that the
HE-IRS requires less pilot overhead than conventional IRSs with the same number
of elements. With the proposed channel estimation and beamforming schemes, the
green HE-IRS achieves competitive sum rate performance with significantly
reduced power consumption.

### [5] [Relaxation-Free Min-k-Partition for PCI Assignment in 5G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10362)
*Yeqing Qiu,Chengpiao Huang,Ye Xue,Zhipeng Jiang,Qingjiang Shi,Dong Zhang,Zhi-Quan Luo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新颖的PCI分配框架，通过分解问题并结合CRT，开发了一种无松弛的Min-$k$-Partition方法，显著提高了计算效率和可扩展性，减少了5G网络中的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCI是5G网络中的关键参数，其高效准确分配对减少干扰、提升网络可靠性和用户体验至关重要。

Method: 将PCI分配问题分解为Min-3-Partition、Min-10-Partition和图着色问题，利用CRT，提出无松弛的Min-$k$-Partition方法，并通过惩罚镜像下降算法求解。

Result: 在大规模5G网络中，该方法显著降低了干扰，消除了碰撞和混淆，计算时间比现有方法快20倍。

Conclusion: 该方法具有潜力提升5G网络性能并降低部署成本。

Abstract: Physical Cell Identity (PCI) is a critical parameter in 5G networks.
Efficient and accurate PCI assignment is essential for mitigating mod-3
interference, mod-30 interference, collisions, and confusions among cells,
which directly affect network reliability and user experience. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework for PCI assignment by decomposing the problem into
Min-3-Partition, Min-10-Partition, and a graph coloring problem, leveraging the
Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Furthermore, we develop a relaxation-free
approach to the general Min-$k$-Partition problem by reformulating it as a
quadratic program with a norm-equality constraint and solving it using a
penalized mirror descent (PMD) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates
superior computational efficiency and scalability, significantly reducing
interference while eliminating collisions and confusions in large-scale 5G
networks. Numerical evaluations on real-world datasets show that our approach
reduces computational time by up to 20 times compared to state-of-the-art
methods, making it highly practical for real-time PCI optimization in
large-scale networks. These results highlight the potential of our method to
improve network performance and reduce deployment costs in modern 5G systems.

### [6] [A Neural Network-aided Low Complexity Chase Decoder for URLLC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10513)
*Enrico Testi,Enrico Paolini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络的增强型Chase-II解码算法，以在URLLC中实现高性能低复杂度的解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: URLLC需要高性能低复杂度的解码算法，现有方法在短码长下无法接近理论性能极限或计算复杂度过高。

Method: 结合神经网络预测扰动模式，减少解码尝试次数，提升效率。

Result: 算法在保持准ML解码可靠性的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该算法适合时间敏感和资源受限的应用，为URLLC提供了可行的解码方案。

Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand decoding algorithms
that simultaneously offer high reliability and low complexity under stringent
latency constraints. While iterative decoding schemes for LDPC and Polar codes
offer a good compromise between performance and complexity, they fall short in
approaching the theoretical performance limits in the typical URLLC short block
length regime. Conversely, quasi-ML decoding schemes for algebraic codes, like
Chase-II decoding, exhibit a smaller gap to optimum decoding but are
computationally prohibitive for practical deployment in URLLC systems. To
bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced Chase-II decoding algorithm that
leverages a neural network (NN) to predict promising perturbation patterns,
drastically reducing the number of required decoding trials. The proposed
approach combines the reliability of quasi-ML decoding with the efficiency of
NN inference, making it well-suited for time-sensitive and resource-constrained
applications.

Abstract: In this letter, a pinching antennas (PAs) assisted rate splitting multiple
access (RSMA) system with multiple waveguides is investigated to maximize sum
rate. A two-step algorithm is proposed to determine PA activation scheme and
optimize the waveguide beamforming. Specifically, a low complexity spatial
correlation and distance based method is proposed for PA activation selection.
After determining the PA activation status, a semi-definite programming (SDP)
based successive convex approximation (SCA) is leveraged to obtain the optimal
waveguide beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed multiple
waveguides based PAs assisted RSMA method achieves better performance than
various benchmarking schemes.

### [8] [Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10662)
*George C. Alexandropoulos,Konstantinos D. Katsanos,Evangelos Vlachos*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种半无源可重构智能表面（RIS）硬件架构，旨在提升多输入多输出（MIMO）通信系统的性能，并基于ADMM提出了一种新型信道估计算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究半无源RIS架构以解决MIMO系统中信道估计和反射系数优化的性能瓶颈。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提算法在多种系统和硬件配置下优于基准方案，并能有效优化RIS的反射系数。

Conclusion: 该方案在FR3及以上频段的通信系统中具有显著优势，为RIS技术的实际应用提供了有效支持。

Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration
for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple
radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase
profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller
encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and
consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel
channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal
training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable
absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its
signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly
used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase
configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation
algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the
entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank
properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for
communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical
investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation
technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware
configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel
estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized
reflection coefficients of its unit elements.

Result: 实验表明，该流水线在先进硬件支持下实现了鲁棒且低噪声的测量，最小测量距离可达1厘米。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为紧凑型传感器在动态环境中的高精度测量提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wearable technologies, such as AR glasses, demands
compact, energy-efficient sensors capable of high-precision measurements in
dynamic environments. Traditional Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW)
Laser Feedback Interferometry (LFI) sensors, while promising, falter in
applications that feature small distances, high velocities, shallow modulation,
and low-power constraints. We propose a novel sensor-processing pipeline that
reliably extracts distance and velocity measurements at distances as low as 1
cm. As a core contribution, we introduce a four-ramp modulation scheme that
resolves persistent ambiguities in beat frequency signs and overcomes spectral
blind regions caused by hardware limitations. Based on measurements of the
implemented pipeline, a noise model is defined to evaluate its performance and
sensitivity to several algorithmic and working point parameters. We show that
the pipeline generally achieves robust and low-noise measurements using
state-of-the-art hardware.

### [10] [Automotive Radar Online Channel Imbalance Estimation via NLMS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10841)
*Esmaeil Kavousi Ghafi,Oliver Lang,Matthias Wagner,Alexander Melzer,Mario Huemer*

Conclusion: 新方法适合在线实时应用，相比现有技术有显著改进，尤其适用于多目标场景。

Abstract: Automotive radars are one of the essential enablers of advanced driver
assistance systems (ADASs). Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and
reliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents
and increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this
context is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the
reliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter
variations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may
affect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In
this work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel
imbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean
squares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to
estimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected
targets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior
knowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in
combination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed
method suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the
normal operation of the radar. Furthermore, it features reduced dependency on
specific targets of interest and faster update rates of the channel imbalance
estimation compared to the majority of state-of-the-art methods. This
improvement is achieved by allowing for multiple targets in the angular
spectrum, whereas most other methods are restricted to only single targets in
the angular spectrum. The performance of the proposed method is validated using
various simulation scenarios and is supported by measurement results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SmoothProper模块，解决稀疏特征图像变形的平滑性和大位移问题，实现高效精准的无监督图像配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏特征图像（如视网膜血管）在无监督图像配准中面临平滑性和大位移问题，现有方法难以解决。

Method: 提出SmoothProper模块，通过双重优化层和定制交互项，在网络前向传播中强制平滑性和消息传递。

Result: 在视网膜血管数据集上，配准误差降至1.88像素，解决了两大挑战。

Conclusion: SmoothPrope是一种模型无关的插件模块，无需调参，可无缝集成现有框架，显著提升配准效果。

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at
https://github.com/tinymilky/SmoothProper.

*Sajjad Karimi,Amit J. Shah,Gari D. Clifford,Reza Sameni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究通过ECG和PCG信号互相重建，发现非线性模型（如非因果LSTM）表现更优，且从PCG重建ECG更容易。基于包络的建模提升了跨主体泛化能力，并能从PCG估计临床ECG标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG和PCG信号分别捕捉心脏的电活动和机械活动，但它们的重叠与独特性信息及互相重建能力尚不完全清楚，尤其是不同生理条件和个体间的差异。

Method: 使用EPHNOGRAM数据集，基于线性和非线性机器学习模型（包括非因果LSTM）进行ECG与PCG的互相重建，分析因果关系、生理状态和跨主体变异性。特别采用了瞬时振幅特征的包络建模。

Result: 非线性模型（尤其是非因果LSTM）重建效果更好，从PCG重建ECG更可行。运动状态和跨主体场景下挑战较大，但包络建模显著提升泛化能力。PCG可估计ECG的临床标志物（如QT间期）。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对ECG与PCG关系的理解，为新型多模态心脏监测技术提供了基础。

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出一种利用低秩因式分解学习无向图的方法，解决了大数据维度下的图学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模数据下，传统的图学习方法因计算复杂度高而难以应用，需要一种高效的方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据上均能高效实现维度与性能的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的低秩约束图学习方法在大规模数据中表现优异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of wireless networks has resulted in numerous
challenges stemming from their extensive demands for quality of service towards
innovative quality of experience metrics (e.g., user-defined metrics in terms
of sense of physical experience for haptics applications). In the meantime,
large language models (LLMs) emerged as promising solutions for many difficult
and complex applications/tasks. These lead to a notion of the integration of
LLMs and wireless networks. However, this integration is challenging and needs
careful attention in design. Therefore, in this article, we present a notion of
rational wireless networks powered by \emph{telecom LLMs}, namely,
\emph{LLM-native wireless systems}. We provide fundamentals, vision, and a case
study of the distributed implementation of LLM-native wireless systems. In the
case study, we propose a solution based on double deep Q-learning (DDQN) that
outperforms existing DDQN solutions. Finally, we provide open challenges.

Abstract: The increasing demand for reliable, high-capacity communication during
large-scale outdoor events poses significant challenges for traditional
Terrestrial Networks (TNs), which often struggle to provide consistent coverage
in high-density environments. This paper presents a novel 6G radio network
planning framework that integrates Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to deliver ubiquitous coverage and
enhanced network capacity. Our framework overcomes the limitations of
conventional deployable base stations by leveraging NTN architectures,
including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and passive RIS platforms seamlessly
integrated with Beyond 5G (B5G) TNs. By incorporating advanced B5G technologies
such as Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and beamforming, and by
optimizing spectrum utilization across the C, S, and Ka bands, we implement a
rigorous interference management strategy based on a dynamic SINR model.
Comprehensive calculations and simulations validate the proposed framework,
demonstrating significant improvements in connectivity, reliability, and
cost-efficiency in crowded scenarios. This integration strategy represents a
promising solution for meeting the evolving demands of future 6G networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 DeepPolar 码在 BER 表现优异但 BLER 不佳，限制了其在实际通信系统中的部署，亟需解决这一性能权衡问题。

Method: 1. 引入注意力增强的解码器架构；2. 设计结构化损失函数；3. 提出自适应 SNR 匹配冗余技术（SMART）。

Result: 在 (256,37) 码配置下，DeepPolar+ 在 BER 和 BLER 上均优于传统方法和 DeepPolar，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: DeepPolar+ 填补了神经极化码理论与实践的差距，为下一代纠错系统提供了可行的方案。

Abstract: DeepPolar codes have recently emerged as a promising approach for channel
coding, demonstrating superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to
conventional polar codes. Despite their excellent BER characteristics, these
codes exhibit suboptimal block error rate (BLER) performance, creating a
fundamental BER-BLER trade-off that severely limits their practical deployment
in communication systems. This paper introduces DeepPolar+, an enhanced neural
polar coding framework that systematically eliminates this BER-BLER trade-off
by simultaneously improving BLER performance while maintaining the superior BER
characteristics of DeepPolar codes. Our approach achieves this breakthrough
through three key innovations: (1) an attention-enhanced decoder architecture
that leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture complex
dependencies between bit positions, (2) a structured loss function that jointly
optimizes for both bit-level accuracy and block-level reliability, and (3) an
adaptive SNR-Matched Redundancy Technique (SMART) for decoding DeepPolar+ code
(DP+SMART decoder) that combines specialized models with CRC verification for
robust performance across diverse channel conditions. For a (256,37) code
configuration, DeepPolar+ demonstrates notable improvements in both BER and
BLER performance compared to conventional successive cancellation decoding and
DeepPolar, while achieving remarkably faster convergence through improved
architecture and optimization strategies. The DeepPolar+SMART variant further
amplifies these dual improvements, delivering significant gains in both error
rate metrics over existing approaches. DeepPolar+ effectively bridges the gap
between theoretical potential and practical implementation of neural polar
codes, offering a viable path forward for next-generation error correction
systems.

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究物理层安全中的异常检测需求，适应轻量化计算、环境变化和相位噪声等挑战。

Method: 采用移动平均滤波器、自回归滤波器和卡尔曼滤波器，结合假设测试设计，实现异常检测。

Result: 案例研究中，基于WiFi设备的算法与信道特征组合有效检测运动；仅随机化发射功率的防御措施不足。

Conclusion: 频率相关的随机化可能是防御此类攻击的更有效解决方案。

Abstract: Various approaches in the field of physical layer security involve anomaly
detection, such as physical layer authentication, sensing attacks, and
anti-tampering solutions. Depending on the context in which these approaches
are applied, anomaly detection needs to be computationally lightweight,
resilient to changes in temperature and environment, and robust against phase
noise. We adapt moving average filters, autoregression filters and Kalman
filters to provide predictions of feature vectors that fulfill the above
criteria. Different hypothesis test designs are employed that allow
omnidirectional and unidirectional outlier detection. In a case study, a
sensing attack is investigated that employs the described algorithms with
various channel features based on commodity WiFi devices. Thereby, various
combinations of algorithms and channel features show effectiveness for motion
detection by an attacker. Countermeasures only utilizing transmit power
randomization are shown insufficient to mitigate such attacks if the attacker
has access to channel state information (CSI) measurements, suggesting that
mitigation solutions might require frequency-variant randomization.
