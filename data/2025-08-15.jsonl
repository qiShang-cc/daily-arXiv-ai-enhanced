To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes two novel modulation schemes that integrate\ncontinuous phase modulation (CPM) with spread spectrum (SS) techniques. We\nbegin by establishing the quasi-orthogonality properties of CPM-SS sequences.\nThe first scheme, termed IM-CPM-SS, employs index modulation (IM) to select\nspreading sequences from the CPM-SS set, thereby improving spectral efficiency\nwhile maintaining the constant-envelope property. The second scheme, referred\nto as CIM-CPM-SS, introduces code index modulation (CIM), which partitions the\ninput bits such that one subset is mapped to phase-shift keying symbols and the\nother to CPM-SS sequence indices. Both schemes are applied to downlink\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. We analyze their performance in\nterms of bit error rate (BER), spectral and energy efficiency, computational\ncomplexity, and peak-to-average power ratio characteristics under nonlinear\namplifier conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that both schemes\noutperform conventional approaches in BER while preserving the benefits of\nconstant-envelope, continuous-phase signaling. Furthermore, they achieve higher\nspectral and energy efficiency and exhibit strong resilience to nonlinear\ndistortions in downlink NOMA scenarios."}

Both communication\nand SAR imaging functionalities are achieved with an integrated transceiver\nonboard the LEO satellite, utilizing the same waveform and radio frequency (RF)\nfront-end. Based on such an architecture, we propose a transmission protocol\ncompatible with the 5G NR standard using downlink pilots for joint channel\nestimation and SAR imaging. Furthermore, we design a unified signal processing\nframework for the integrated satellite receiver to simultaneously achieve\nhigh-performance channel sensing, low-complexity channel equalization and\ninterference-free SAR imaging. Finally, the performance of the proposed\nintegrated system is demonstrated through comprehensive analysis and extensive\nsimulations in the sub-6 GHz band.

It is normally assumed that the\nwavefront distortion in these phase reference pulses is identical to the\nwavefront distortion in the quantum signals, which are multiplexed during\ntransmission. However, in many real-world deployments, there can exist a\nrelative wavefront error (WFE) between the reference pulses and quantum\nsignals, which, among other deleterious effects, can severely limit secure key\ntransfer in satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD. In this work, we introduce novel machine\nlearning-based wavefront correction algorithms, which utilize multi-plane light\nconversion for decomposition of the reference pulses and quantum signals into\nthe Hermite-Gaussian (HG) basis, then estimate the difference in HG mode phase\nmeasurements, effectively eliminating this problem. Through detailed\nsimulations of the Earth-satellite channel, we demonstrate that our new\nalgorithm can rapidly identify and compensate for any relative WFEs that may\nexist, whilst causing no harm when WFEs are similar across both the reference\npulses and quantum signals. We quantify the gains available in our algorithm in\nterms of the CV-QKD secure key rate. We show channels where positive secure key\nrates are obtained using our algorithms, while information loss without\nwavefront correction would result in null key rates."}

This preliminary\nstudy addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological\nfeatures from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with\ncontinuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated\nSignal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and\nelectrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking\nvideos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random\nExperiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically\ncontrolling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate.

These results highlight the necessity of rigorous\nreproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect\noften overlooked in Affective Computing.

We investigated physiological and subjective responses to\npersonal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening\nfacial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence\nthese responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2x2 factorial design\nmanipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression\n(neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart\nrate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were\nindividually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR\nresponses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the\napproach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged\nproximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing\nthan the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV,\nreflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort\nratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that\ndifferent physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic\nresponses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV\nresponds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing\ncomprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual\nenvironments and inform the design of more realistic avatar interactions."}

The goal of time series\ngenerative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate\nhigh-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics.
