### [1] [A Leap-on-Success Exhaustive Search Method to Find Optimal Robust Minimum Redundancy Arrays (RMRAs): New Array Configurations for Sensor Counts 11 to 20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10706)
*Pradyumna Kunchala,Ashish Patwari*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文介绍了针对11至15个传感器的优化RMRA配置，使用新型Leap-on-Success算法减少计算量，并通过MATLAB验证其抗故障能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计能够在单传感器故障时保持精度的高冗余稀疏阵列（TFRAs），尤其是优化的RMRAs。

Method: 采用Leap-on-Success穷举搜索算法，找到11至15个传感器的最优RMRA配置。

Result: 发现了11至15传感器的最优配置，验证了其在单故障情景下的稳健性，同时提供了16至20传感器的近优解。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅推进了RMRA设计的最新技术，还为未来阵列优化提供了有效搜索方法。

Abstract: Two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRAs) are designed to maintain accurate
direction estimation even in the event of a single sensor failure, leveraging
the deliberate coarray redundancy infused into their design. Robust Minimum
Redundancy Arrays (RMRAs), a specialized class of TFRAs, optimize this
redundancy to achieve the maximum possible aperture for a given number of
sensors. However, finding optimal RMRA configurations is an NP-hard problem,
with prior research reporting optimal solutions only for arrays of up to ten
sensors. This paper presents newly discovered optimal RMRA configurations for
array sizes 11 to 15, identified using a novel Leap-on-Success exhaustive
search algorithm that efficiently reduces computational effort by terminating
the search upon locating optimal solutions. The robustness of these arrays was
validated under all single-element failure scenarios using MATLAB simulations,
confirming their superior resilience compared to some existing TFRAs vulnerable
to failures at specific sensor positions. Furthermore, near-optimal
configurations for array sizes 16 to 20 are also reported, highlighting the
potential applicability of the proposed method for larger array designs given
sufficient computational resources. This work not only advances the
state-of-the-art in RMRA design but also introduces an effective search
methodology that can be leveraged for future explorations in array
configuration optimization.

### [2] [Waterfilling at the Edge: Optimal Percentile Resource Allocation via Risk-Averse Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10838)
*Gokberk Yaylali,Ahmad Ali Khan,Dionysios S. Kalogerias*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于CVaR的资源分配方法，用于优化多终端AWGN信道中的边缘终端服务速率，通过凸优化和拉格朗日对偶性提供精确的水填充策略和收敛算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统效用方法在边缘终端速率优化中的局限性，如保守性或不适用性，需一种更严格且可解释的公平优化方法。

Method: 采用CVaR作为风险度量，建立其与SLαQ效用的等价性，并通过拉格朗日对偶性提供闭式解和低复杂度算法。

Result: 提出的边缘水填充算法有效且高效地分配资源，确保边缘终端速率公平，并通过大规模实验验证其稳健性。

Conclusion: CVaR和SLαQ效用的结合为边缘终端速率优化提供了精确且可解释的框架，算法具有全局最优性和高效性。

Abstract: We address deterministic resource allocation in point-to-point multi-terminal
AWGN channels without inter-terminal interference, with particular focus on
optimizing quantile transmission rates for cell-edge terminal service.
Classical utility-based approaches -- such as minimum rate, sumrate, and
proportional fairness -- are either overconservative, or inappropriate, or do
not provide a rigorous and/or interpretable foundation for fair rate
optimization at the edge. To overcome these challenges, we employ Conditional
Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a popular coherent risk measure, and establish its
equivalence with the sum-least-$\alpha$th-quantile (SL$\alpha$Q) utility. This
connection enables an exact convex reformulation of the SL$\alpha$Q
maximization problem, facilitating analytical tractability and precise and
interpretable control over cell-edge terminal performance. Utilizing Lagrangian
duality, we provide (for the first time) parameterized closed-form solutions
for the optimal resource policy -- which is of waterfilling-type -- as well as
the associated (auxiliary) Value-at-Risk variable. We further develop a novel
inexact dual subgradient descent algorithm of minimal complexity to determine
globally optimal resource policies, and we rigorously establish its
convergence. The resulting edge waterfilling algorithm iteratively and
efficiently allocates resources while explicitly ensuring transmission rate
fairness across (cell-edge) terminals. Several (even large-scale) numerical
experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for enabling
robust quantile rate optimization at the edge.

### [3] [Dual RIS-Assisted Monostatic L-Band Radar Target Detection in NLoS Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11036)
*Salman Liaquat,Ijaz Haider Naqvi,Nor Muzlifah Mahyuddin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了双RIS辅助雷达在NLoS场景中的信号增强效果，相比单RIS系统，双RIS配置能显著提升目标检测的SNR和定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在单RIS辅助雷达无法覆盖目标区域的情况下，探索双RIS配置以解决信号障碍问题。

Method: 推导了双RIS辅助雷达在NLoS场景中的SNR表达式，计算接收功率，并通过RIS数量、单元数及位置选择优化性能。

Result: 双RIS系统在适当配置下显著提升SNR，优于单RIS系统。

Conclusion: 双RIS配置是提升雷达目标检测能力的有效方法，尤其在复杂障碍环境中。

Abstract: The use of a single Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) to boost the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the radar offers significant improvement in
detecting targets, especially in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. However,
there are scenarios where no path exists between the radar and the target, even
with a single RIS-assisted radar, due to other present obstacles. This paper
derives an expression for SNR in target detection scenarios where dual RISs
assist a monostatic radar in NLoS situations. We calculate the power received
at the radar through a dual RIS configuration. We show that the SNR performance
of RIS-assisted radars can improve with known locations of the radar and RISs.
Our results demonstrate that the required accuracy in target localization can
be achieved by controlling the number of RISs, the number of unit cells in each
RIS, and properly selecting the locations of RISs to cover the desired region.
The performance of dual RIS-assisted radar systems can surpass that of single
RIS-assisted radar systems under favourable alignment and sufficiently large
RIS sizes.

### [4] [Optimizing Fluid Antenna Configurations for Constructive Interference Precoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11093)
*Wenxuan Sun,Mingjie Shao,Luteng Zhu,Yao Ge,Tong Zhang,Zhi Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在多用户MIMO通信中，通过流体天线系统（FAS）和构造性干扰预编码，最小化符号错误概率（SEP），并提出了低计算复杂度的优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过FAS和构造性干扰预编码提升多用户MIMO通信的性能，弥补传统固定天线阵列的不足。

Method: 将SEP最小化问题转化为安全裕度最大化问题，采用平滑技术和块坐标下降（BCD）算法进行优化。

Result: 相比固定天线阵列和PSO设计的FAS，提出的方法降低了比特错误率（BER），且计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: 提出的FAS结合低复杂度优化方法在多用户MIMO通信中具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a new physical-layer concept to
provide enhanced propagation conditions for multiuser multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) communications over conventional fixed arrays. This work
focuses on minimizing the maximum symbol error probability (SEP) under $M$-ary
phase shift keying (MPSK) signaling in a multiuser downlink equipped with FAS,
where each antenna moves within nonoverlapping intervals. This specific problem
of joint SEP minimization with FAS and constructive interference (CI) precoding
has not been previously addressed. The resulting problem turns out to be a
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization challenge. We transform the SEP
minimization problem into a safety margin maximization problem in constructive
interference precoding. Then, we customize a smoothing technique and a block
coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, with emphasis on low computational
complexity. Simulation results show that our approach can reduce bit error rate
(BER) compared to both the fixed arrays and FAS designed by existing particle
swarm optimization (PSO). Also, our approach shows attractively low
computational complexity compared to PSO benchmarks.

Result: 仿真结果验证了系统在平均保密率、平均数据速率和波束增益方面的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效确保了ISAC系统的安全性和公平性。

Abstract: We propose a novel secure integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system
designed to serve multiple communication users (CUs) and targets. To that end,
we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the secrecy rate under
constraints balancing both communication and sensing requirements. To enhance
fairness among users, an entropy-regularized fairness metric is introduced
within the problem framework. We then propose a solution employing an
accelerated quadratic transform (QT) with a non-homogeneous bound to
iteratively solve two subproblems, thereby effectively optimizing the overall
objective. This approach ensures robust security and fairness in resource
allocation for ISAC systems. Finally, simulation results verify the performance
gains in terms of average secrecy rate, average data rate, and beam gain.

### [6] [Fast and Efficient Implementation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation for the Linear Regression with Gaussian Model Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11249)
*Ruohai Guo,Jiang Zhu,Xing Jiang,Fengzhong Qu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文扩展了随机测量矩阵的线性回归模型分析，证明了MLE问题的凸性和强对偶性，并提出了一种快速统一的GRV-ML算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机测量矩阵在均值秩不足情况下的线性回归模型，填补理论空白并提升估计效率。

Method: 通过理论分析证明MLE问题的凸性和强对偶性，并开发统一的GRV-ML算法。

Result: 仿真验证了理论发现，表明随机性在特定条件下可能提升估计性能。

Conclusion: GRV-ML算法在理论和实践中展现了优越性，扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: The linear regression model with a random variable (RV) measurement matrix,
where the mean of the random measurement matrix has full column rank, has been
extensively studied. In particular, the quasiconvexity of the maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) problem was established, and the corresponding
Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) was derived, leading to the development of an efficient
bisection-based algorithm known as RV-ML. In contrast, this work extends the
analysis to both overdetermined and underdetermined cases, allowing the mean of
the random measurement matrix to be rank-deficient. A remarkable contribution
is the proof that the equivalent MLE problem is convex and satisfies strong
duality, strengthening previous quasiconvexity results. Moreover, it is shown
that in underdetermined scenarios, the randomness in the measurement matrix can
be beneficial for estimation under certain conditions. In addition, a fast and
unified implementation of the MLE solution, referred to as generalized RV-ML
(GRV-ML), is proposed, which handles a more general case including both
underdetermined and overdetermined systems. Extensive numerical simulations are
provided to validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with radar imaging sensors
has revolutionized the monitoring of dynamic and local Earth surface processes
by enabling high-resolution and cost-effective remote sensing. This paper
investigates the optimization of the sensing accuracy of a UAV swarm deployed
to perform multi-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)
sensing. In conventional single-baseline InSAR systems, only one synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) antenna pair acquires two SAR images from two distinct
angles to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) of the target area. However,
multi-baseline InSAR extends this concept by aggregating multiple acquisitions
from different angles, thus, significantly enhancing the vertical accuracy of
the DEM. The heavy computations required for this process are performed on the
ground and, therefore, the radar data is transmitted in real time to a ground
station (GS) via a frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) air-to-ground
backhaul link. This work focuses on improving the sensing precision by
minimizing the height error of the averaged DEM while simultaneously ensuring
sensing and communication quality-of-service (QoS). To this end, the UAV
formation, velocity, and communication power allocation are jointly optimized
using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Our approach is benchmarked against
established optimization methods, including genetic algorithms (GAs), simulated
annealing (SA), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. Numerical
results show that the proposed solution outperforms these baseline schemes and
achieves sub-decimeter vertical accuracy in several scenarios. These findings
underline the potential of coordinated UAV swarms for delivering high-precision
and real-time Earth observations through radar interferometry.

TL;DR: 研究了稀疏回归码（SPARC）在多用户多接收天线非相干平坦衰落信道中的应用，提出了一种新型实用解码器MLMP，性能优于传统稀疏恢复算法和极化码导频传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在多用户多接收天线非相干平坦衰落信道中，如何利用稀疏回归码（SPARC）提高通信性能，尤其是在无需信道状态信息的情况下。

Method: 提出了一种名为最大似然匹配追踪（MLMP）的贪婪解码器，通过部分最大似然度量逐步检测用户码字支持，并优化了高码率下的性能。

Result: 在短块长度下，SPARC与MLMP解码器能够实现多用户分集，在某些场景中比单用户性能更好，且优于传统稀疏恢复算法和极化码导频传输。

Conclusion: MLMP解码器在多用户非相干信道中表现出色，展示了SPARC在无信道状态信息条件下的潜力，为未来通信系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study sparse regression codes (SPARC) for multiple access channels with
multiple receive antennas, in non-coherent flat fading channels. We propose a
novel practical decoder, referred to as maximum likelihood matching pursuit
(MLMP), which greedily finds the support of the codewords of users with partial
maximum likelihood metrics. As opposed to the conventional
successive-cancellation based greedy algorithms, MLMP works as a
successive-combining energy detector. We also propose MLMP modifications to
improve the performance at high code rates. Our studies in short block lengths
show that, even without any channel state information, SPARC with MLMP decoder
achieves multi-user diversity in some scenarios, giving better error
performance with multiple users than that of the corresponding single-user
case. We also show that SPARC with MLMP performs better than conventional
sparse recovery algorithms and pilot-aided transmissions with polar codes.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究智能反射面辅助通信系统中联合功率分配与反射单元激活以最大化能量效率，考虑信道状态信息不完美性，提出两种算法：交替优化与分支定界法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信道状态信息不完美下的能效最大化问题。

Method: 交替优化法（基于Lambert W函数与动态规划）和分支定界法。

Result: 算法性能优于基线，交替优化接近最优，分支定界计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: 两种算法无需外部优化求解器，有效解决了混合整数优化问题。

Abstract: We study the joint power allocation and reflecting element (RE) activation to
maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in communication systems assisted by an
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), taking into account imperfections in
channel state information (CSI). The robust optimization problem is mixed
integer, i.e., the optimization variables are continuous (transmit power) and
discrete (binary states of REs). In order to solve this challenging problem we
develop two algorithms. The first one is an alternating optimization (AO)
method that attains a suboptimal solution with low complexity, based on the
Lambert W function and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The second one is
a branch-and-bound (B&B) method that uses AO as its subroutine and is formally
guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal solution. Both algorithms do not
require any external optimization solver for their implementation. Furthermore,
numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline
schemes, AO achieves near-optimal performance in most cases, and B&B has low
computational complexity on average.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for binaural reproduction from arbitrary

through Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) pre-processing. The proposed
approach integrates array-specific information into the HRTF processing
pipeline, leading to improved spatial accuracy in binaural rendering. Objective
evaluations demonstrate superior performance under simulated wearable-array and

Result: MP-QLSTM和MP-QGRU测试损失比经典LSTM/GRU低1.5%，均方根百分比误差为0.256%。

Conclusion: 该方法在高维预测任务中表现出高精度和有效性。

Abstract: A time-series forecasting method for high-dimensional spatial data is
proposed. The method involves optimal selection of sparse sensor positions to
efficiently represent the spatial domain, time-series forecasting at these
positions, and estimation of the entire spatial distribution from the
forecasted values via a learned decoder. Sensor positions are selected using a
method based on combinatorial optimization. Introducing multi-parallelized
quantum long short-term memory (MP-QLSTM) and gated recurrent unit (MP-QGRU)
improves time-series forecasting performance by extending QLSTM models using
the same number of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) as the cell state
dimensions. Unlike the original QLSTM, our method fully measures all qubits in
each VQC, maximizing the representation capacity. MP-QLSTM and MP-QGRU achieve
approximately 1.5% lower test loss than classical LSTM and GRU. The root mean
squared percentage error of MP-QLSTM is 0.256% against the values measured
independently using semiconductor pressure sensors, demonstrating the method's
accuracy and effectiveness for high-dimensional forecasting tasks.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文研究了在粗量化大规模MIMO下行链路中，使用图神经网络进行非线性预编码的方法，显著提高了可实现的总和速率，同时降低了数模转换器的功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模MIMO系统的发展，数模转换器在硬件复杂性和功耗方面成为瓶颈。因此，需要一种高效的方法在粗量化条件下实现高性能预编码。

Method: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的非线性预编码方法，通过自监督训练直接最大化可实现速率，并使用Gumbel-softmax估计梯度克服目标函数不可微的问题。

Result: 在单用户情况下，该方法使用1位数模转换器即可达到与最大比传输（MRT）相同的总和速率，功耗降低了4-7倍（基带数模转换器）和3倍（射频数模转换器）。

Conclusion: 该方法在粗量化条件下显著提升了性能和功耗效率，但增加了数字信号处理的功耗。系统带宽在3.5 MHz以下时，总体功耗仍可降低，而射频数模转换器在高带宽下也能保持功耗降低2.9倍。

Abstract: Massive MIMO systems are moving toward increased numbers of radio frequency
chains, higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths. As such,
digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of
hardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding
for coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard
nature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly
outputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the
intended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by
directly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability
of the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC
functions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is
proposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum
rate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the
proposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission
(MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the
DAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs
respectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal
processing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in
overall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for
baseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for
higher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power
consumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other
components, are not considered in this analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中，大规模MIMO系统的天线数量增加导致FDD系统中的CSI反馈需求大幅上升，而现有研究在参考信号分配方面的探索不足。

Method: 引入CPRS概念，结合ViViT/CNN架构，将信道状态信息视为图像序列处理，实现高效自适应传输。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在吞吐量上比基准策略提升高达36.60%。

Conclusion: CPRS方法为减少反馈开销和优化传输性能提供了有效解决方案，且符合标准。

Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as
the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially
increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency
division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused
on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining
momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced
standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited
beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such
constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce
the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS),
which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data
throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a
standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by
treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling
efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results
using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed
method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.

Motivation: 解决EEG情感识别中时间尺度依赖标签不一致（TsDLI）问题，以提升模型性能和可解释性。

Method: 提出两种正则化策略：局部变化损失（LVL）和局部-全局一致性损失（LGCL），结合有界变分函数和通勤时间距离，并设计新评估指标。

Result: 在DREAMER和DEAP数据集上验证，LVL和LGCL在多种神经网络架构中表现优于现有方法，LVL综合表现最佳。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了TsDLI问题，平衡了预测性能和可解释性，为EEG情感识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent
Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based
human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization
and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local
Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods
incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of
bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic
framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new
evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local
predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our
approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion
datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including
LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct
metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.
Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled
trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label
inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all
benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second,
highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion
detection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and
IIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled
cyber-attack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions.
This data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the
effective training of machine learning models. Moreover, rapid detection of
attacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent
large-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time
intrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning
framework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages
abundant unlabeled data to distinguish between normal and attack behaviors
effectively. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15,
BoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20 percent, 1.28 percent, and 8 percent
of labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive
learning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer
perceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection
accuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model
complex relationships and its learnable activation functions are also explored
and visualized, offering interpretability and potential for rule extraction.
The method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in
safety-critical environments where reliability is paramount.

Abstract: A Gaussian Noise Model of the nonlinear noise power spectral density is
developed for a semiconductor optical amplifier as described by the Agrawal
model. A simple closed-form expression is obtained for the nonlinear
noise-to-signal ratio of broadband wavelength-division multiplexed signals as a
function of the Agrawal model parameters, the amplifier output power and the
transmission bandwidth. The accuracy of the closed-form expression and its
region of validity is assessed in numerical simulations. The error is smaller
than 0.1 dB when the product of bandwidth and gain recovery time
$B\times\tau_c$ exceeds 100.

Conclusion: 新方法在TTTM中表现优异，同时对多变量算法的超参数敏感性进行了分析。

Abstract: We consider the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM), also called, chamber
matching in the context of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Traditional
TTTM approaches utilize static configuration data or depend on a golden
reference which are difficult to obtain in a commercial manufacturing line.
Further, existing methods do not extend very well to a heterogeneous setting,
where equipment are of different make-and-model, sourced from different
equipment vendors. We propose novel TTTM analysis pipelines to overcome these
issues. We hypothesize that a mismatched equipment would have higher variance
and/or higher number of modes in the data. Our best univariate method achieves
a correlation coefficient >0.95 and >0.5 with the variance and number of modes,
respectively showing that the proposed methods are effective. Also, the best
multivariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.75 with the
top-performing univariate methods, showing its effectiveness. Finally, we
analyze the sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to the algorithm
hyper-parameters.

Abstract: Time-Frequency (TF) dual-path models are currently among the best performing
audio source separation network architectures, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in speech enhancement, music source separation, and cinematic audio
source separation. While they are characterized by a relatively low parameter
count, they still require a considerable number of operations, implying a
higher execution time. This problem is exacerbated by the trend towards bigger
models trained on large amounts of data to solve more general tasks, such as
the recently introduced task-aware unified source separation (TUSS) model.
TUSS, which aims to solve audio source separation tasks using a single,
conditional model, is built upon TF-Locoformer, a TF dual-path model combining
convolution and attention layers. The task definition comes in the form of a
sequence of prompts that specify the number and type of sources to be
extracted. In this paper, we analyze the design choices of TUSS with the goal
of optimizing its performance-complexity trade-off. We derive two more
efficient models, FasTUSS-8.3G and FasTUSS-11.7G that reduce the original
model's operations by 81\% and 73\% with minor performance drops of 1.2~dB and
0.4~dB averaged over all benchmarks, respectively. Additionally, we investigate
the impact of prompt conditioning to derive a causal TUSS model.
