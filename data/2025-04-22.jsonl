However, the massive number of user equipments (UEs) poses a\nsignificant challenge to the cellular network's random access channel (RACH)\nregarding congestion and overloading. To mitigate this problem, we first\npresent a novel approach to model a two-priority RACH, which allows us to\ndefine access patterns that describe the random access behavior of UEs as\nobserved by the base station (BS). A non-uniform preamble selection scheme is\nproposed, offering increased flexibility in resource allocation for different\nUE priority classes. Then, we formulate an allocation model that finds the\noptimal access probabilities to maximize the success rate of high-priority UEs\nwhile constraining low-priority UEs.

Unlike conventional patch-based EMG\nsystems, which require large-area electrodes on the face or neck, our approach\nensures comfort, discretion, and wearability while maintaining robust silent\nspeech decoding. The system utilizes four graphene/PEDOT:PSS-coated textile\nelectrodes to capture speech-related neuromuscular activity, with signals\nprocessed via a compact ESP32-S3-based wireless readout module. To address the\nchallenge of variable skin-electrode coupling, we propose a 1D SE-ResNet\narchitecture incorporating squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks to dynamically\nadjust per-channel attention weights, enhancing robustness against\nmotion-induced impedance variations. The proposed system achieves 96% accuracy\non 10 commonly used voice-free control words, outperforming conventional\nsingle-channel and non-adaptive baselines. Experimental validation, including\nXAI-based attention analysis and t-SNE feature visualization, confirms the\nadaptive channel selection capability and effective feature extraction of the\nmodel. This work advances wearable EMG-based SSIs, demonstrating a scalable,\nlow-power, and user-friendly platform for silent communication, assistive\ntechnologies, and human-computer interaction."}

Data-aided enhanced receivers, by incorporating domain\nknowledge, effectively mitigate performance degradation caused by imperfect\nCSI, particularly in dynamic wireless environments. However, existing\nmethodologies face notable challenges: they either refine channel estimates\nwithin MIMO subsystems separately, which proves ineffective due to deviations\nfrom assumptions regarding the time-varying nature of channels, or fully\nexploit the time-frequency characteristics but incur significantly high\ncomputational overhead due to dimensional concatenation. To address these\nissues, this study introduces a novel data-aided method aimed at reducing\ncomplexity, particularly suited for fast-fading scenarios in fifth-generation\n(5G) and beyond networks. We derive a general form of a data-aided linear\nminimum mean-square error (LMMSE)-based algorithm, optimized for iterative\njoint channel estimation and signal detection. Additionally, we propose a\ncomputationally efficient alternative to this algorithm, which achieves\ncomparable performance with significantly reduced complexity. Empirical\nevaluations reveal that our proposed algorithms outperform several\nstate-of-the-art approaches across various MIMO-OFDM configurations, pilot\nsequence lengths, and in the presence of time variability. Comparative analysis\nwith basis expansion model-based iterative receivers highlights the superiority\nof our algorithms in achieving an effective trade-off between accuracy and\ncomputational complexity."}
