### [1] [Foundation Models for Brain Signals: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11783)
*Gayal Kuruppu,Neeraj Wagh,Yogatheesan Varatharajah*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文综述了10种早期自监督脑电图（EEG）基础模型（EEG-FMs），分析了其方法、实证结果及研究空白，指出当前模型评估的局限性，并提出了未来研究的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG编码器依赖昂贵的信号注释，且难以学习稳健的EEG模式，因此转向自监督EEG基础模型以提取稳健特征。但对于早期模型的实用性和长期研究方向的指导尚不清晰。

Method: 综述分析了10种早期EEG-FMs，重点研究了其方法学、核心技术和自我监督策略。

Result: 大多数EEG-FMs采用基于序列的建模方案（如Transformer）和掩码序列重建的自我监督方法，但评估标准不均且实用性有限。

Conclusion: 未来研究需标准化评估、展示更强的扩展效应，并与领域专家合作开发基准和工具，以提高EEG-FMs的实用性和实际应用。

Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography
(EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The
inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their
over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards
general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models
(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the
real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research
progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of
first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current
state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,
this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their
methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that
most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on
transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for
self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely
limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.
In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work
should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and
trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We
believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies,
and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the
translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

### [2] [Directional Measurements and Analysis for FR3 Low-Altitude Channels in a Campus Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11846)
*Yulu Guo,Tongjia Zhang,Xiangwen Gu,Shu Sun,Meixia Tao,Ruifeng Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文介绍了FR3频段在校园环境中的低空信道测量，通过时域信道探测系统进行路径损耗和功率角度谱测量，分析了不同环境下的传播行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FR3频段低空信道的传播特性，为新兴中频段通信系统的信道建模提供基础数据。

Method: 使用时域信道探测系统进行两种测量：路径损耗测量（移动发射机）和功率角度谱测量（天线扫描）。

Result: 路径损耗分析显示闭合模型优于传统3GPP模型，功率角度谱测量表明传播行为随环境变化显著。

Conclusion: 低空传播受发射机高度和地面散射机制复杂交互影响，为信道建模提供了重要参考。

Abstract: In this paper, we present detailed low-altitude channel measurements at the
FR3 band in an outdoor campus environment. Using a time-domain channel sounder
system, we conduct two types of measurements: path loss measurements by moving
the transmitter (Tx) at one-meter intervals along a 26-point rooftop path, and
directional power angular spectrum measurements through antenna scanning at
half-power beam width intervals. The path loss analysis across different Rx
shows that the close-in model outperforms conventional 3GPP models and
height-corrected variants, with path loss exponents close to free space values
indicating line-of-sight dominance. The power angular spectrum measurements
show that propagation behavior varies significantly with environmental
conditions. Closer Rx exhibit stronger sensitivity to ground reflections during
downward Tx tilting, while obstructed links display uniform angular
characteristics due to dominant scattering effects, and corridor environments
produce asymmetric power distributions. These results indicate that
low-altitude propagation is characterized by complex interactions between Tx
height and ground scattering mechanisms, providing fundamental insights for
channel modeling in emerging mid-band communication systems.

### [3] [Joint UAV Placement and Transceiver Design in Multi-User Wireless Relay Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11912)
*Tzu-Hsuan Chou,Nicolo Michelusi,David J. Love,James V. Krogmeier*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的方法，通过优化无人机中继的放置、中继波束成形和接收组合，提高非正交多用户无线中继网络中用户的最小信干噪比（SINR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决非正交多用户无线中继网络中用户SINR不足的问题，尤其是在缺乏瞬时信道状态信息（CSI）时优化无人机中继放置的挑战。

Method: 方法包括利用大规模MIMO基站的窄波束特性近似预计的波束成形SINR，并基于此提出无人机放置算法和联合中继波束成形与接收组合（JRBC）算法。

Result: 数值结果显示，提出的算法组合相比现有技术方案将SINR提高了4.6 dB。

Conclusion: 结论表明该方法能够有效提升非正交多用户中继网络中的SINR性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to improve the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) among users in non-orthogonal
multi-user wireless relay networks, by optimizing the placement of unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) relays, relay beamforming, and receive combining. The
design is separated into two problems: beamforming-aware UAV placement
optimization and transceiver design for minimum SINR maximization. A
significant challenge in beamforming-aware UAV placement optimization is the
lack of instantaneous channel state information (CSI) prior to deploying UAV
relays, making it difficult to derive the beamforming SINR in non-orthogonal
multi-user transmission. To address this issue, an approximation of the
expected beamforming SINR is derived using the narrow beam property of a
massive MIMO base station. Based on this, a UAV placement algorithm is proposed
to provide UAV positions that improve the minimum expected beamforming SINR
among users, using a difference-of-convex framework. Subsequently, after
deploying the UAV relays to the optimized positions, and with estimated CSI
available, a joint relay beamforming and receive combining (JRBC) algorithm is
proposed to optimize the transceiver to improve the minimum beamforming SINR
among users, using a block-coordinate descent approach. Numerical results show
that the UAV placement algorithm combined with the JRBC algorithm provides a
4.6 dB SINR improvement over state-of-the-art schemes.

### [4] [Scene Graph-Aided Probabilistic Semantic Communication for Image Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11913)
*Chen Zhu,Siyun Liang,Zhouxiang Zhao,Jianrong Bao,Zhaohui Yang,Zhaoyang Zhang,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率图的无线图像语义通信框架，通过两阶段压缩算法提升传输效率，验证了利用高层语义进行图像通信的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络拥堵和提升传输效率，强调语义而非原始符号的传输。

Result: 仿真结果显示方案在传输吞吐量和语义对齐方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 验证了利用高层语义进行图像通信的可行性，并提出了进一步的多轮语义压缩算法。

Abstract: Semantic communication emphasizes the transmission of meaning rather than raw
symbols. It offers a promising solution to alleviate network congestion and
improve transmission efficiency. In this paper, we propose a wireless image
communication framework that employs probability graphs as shared semantic
knowledge base among distributed users. High-level image semantics are
represented via scene graphs, and a two-stage compression algorithm is devised
to remove predictable components based on learned conditional and co-occurrence
probabilities. At the transmitter, the algorithm filters redundant relations
and entity pairs, while at the receiver, semantic recovery leverages the same
probability graphs to reconstruct omitted information. For further research, we
also put forward a multi-round semantic compression algorithm with its
theoretical performance analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that our
semantic-aware scheme achieves superior transmission throughput and satiable
semantic alignment, validating the efficacy of leveraging high-level semantics
for image communication.

*Wei Zhou,Wei-Jian Li,Wei-Xin Ren*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: TFMD是一种新颖的信号分解方法，通过将信号转换为时频图并分割高能量区域，实现了快速、鲁棒且自适应的多组分信号分解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在准确性、计算成本和先验信息需求之间的权衡问题。

Method: 将信号转换为时频图，通过平滑、自适应阈值和连通域标记分割高能量区域，重建信号模式。

Result: TFMD在多种合成信号和高噪声条件下表现优异，计算效率高。

Conclusion: TFMD为多组分信号分析提供了一种高效、精确且实用的新范式。

Abstract: The decomposition of complex, multicomponent, and non-stationary signals into
their constituent modes is a fundamental yet significant challenge in science
and engineering. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off among
accuracy, computational cost, and the need for prior information such as the
number of modes. This paper introduces time-frequency mode decomposition
(TFMD), a novel framework for the fast, robust, and adaptive decomposition of
such signals. TFMD operates on the principle that modes form contiguous
high-energy regions in the time-frequency domain. Its non-iterative pipeline
reframes signal decomposition as an image segmentation task: a signal is
transformed into a spectrogram, which is then smoothed to enhance the
continuity of these high-energy regions. A sequence of adaptive thresholding
and connected-component labeling with size-based filtering is then employed to
automatically segment the spectrogram and generate a mask for each mode. The
modes are finally reconstructed via the inverse short-time Fourier transform.
Validation on diverse synthetic signals demonstrates that TFMD accurately
determines the number of modes and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Its
performance is particularly strong in high-noise conditions. A comparative
analysis confirms that TFMD provides robust, competitive performance across a
wider variety of signal types, while a theoretical complexity analysis reveals
its superior computational efficiency stemming from its non-iterative design.
The method's practical utility is further demonstrated by successfully
extracting modal responses from a real-world footbridge vibration signal. TFMD
provides a computationally efficient and powerful paradigm for multicomponent
signal analysis, offering a compelling balance of accuracy, versatility, and
efficiency for large-scale or time-sensitive applications.

### [6] [DSSD: Efficient Edge-Device Deployment and Collaborative Inference via Distributed Split Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12000)
*Jiahong Ning,Ce Zheng,Tingting Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: DSSD是一种新型架构，通过设备与边缘协同验证机制减少通信延迟，同时保持推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有设备与边缘协作框架中推理准确性与延迟或上行传输成本的问题。

Method: 提出分布式分割推测解码（DSSD），将验证阶段分区处理，减少上行传输次数。

Result: 实验表明DSSD在减少通信延迟的同时保持推理质量，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DSSD通过优化验证阶段的分区处理，提升了设备与边缘协作的效率与性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing but
face critical deployment challenges in device-edge systems due to resource
limitations and communication overhead. To address these issues, collaborative
frameworks have emerged that combine small language models (SLMs) on devices
with LLMs at the edge, using speculative decoding (SD) to improve efficiency.
However, existing solutions often trade inference accuracy for latency or
suffer from high uplink transmission costs when verifying candidate tokens. In
this paper, we propose Distributed Split Speculative Decoding (DSSD), a novel
architecture that not only preserves the SLM-LLM split but also partitions the
verification phase between the device and edge. In this way, DSSD replaces the
uplink transmission of multiple vocabulary distributions with a single downlink
transmission, significantly reducing communication latency while maintaining
inference quality. Experiments show that our solution outperforms current
methods, and codes are at:

Abstract: With the upcoming capabilities of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
and the incorporation of user equipment (UE) like unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) in 6G mobile networks, there is a significant opportunity to enhance
situational awareness through multi-static radar sensing in meshed ISAC
networks. This paper presents a real-world channel sounding data set acquired
using a testbed with synchronized, distributed ground-based sensor nodes and
flying sensor nodes within a swarm of up to four drones. The conducted
measurement campaign is designed to sense the bi-static reflectivity of objects
such as parking cars, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, and small
drones in multi-path environments. We detail the rationale behind the selection
of the included scenarios and the configuration of the participating nodesand
present exemplary results to demonstrate the potential of using collaborating
drone swarms for multi-static radar tracking and localization in air-to-air
(A2A) and air-to-ground (A2G) scenarios. The data sets are publicly available
to support the development and validation of future ISAC algorithms in
real-world environments rather than relying solely on simulation.

### [8] [DoRF: Doppler Radiance Fields for Robust Human Activity Recognition Using Wi-Fi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12132)
*Navid Hasanzadeh,Shahrokh Valaee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Wi-Fi CSI的3D潜在运动表示方法（受NeRF启发），称为DoRF，显著提升了基于Wi-Fi的人类活动识别的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wi-Fi CSI多普勒速度投影方法泛化能力不足，难以实际部署。作者受NeRF启发，希望构建3D潜在运动表示以提升鲁棒性。

Method: 通过Wi-Fi CSI提取的一维多普勒速度投影，重建3D潜在运动表示，并构建统一的Doppler辐射场（DoRF）。

Result: DoRF提供了对活动的全面观察，显著提升了Wi-Fi HAR的泛化精度。

Conclusion: DoRF在Wi-Fi传感应用中表现出强大潜力，为实际部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has gained increasing interest for
remote sensing applications. Recent studies show that Doppler velocity
projections extracted from CSI can enable human activity recognition (HAR) that
is robust to environmental changes and generalizes to new users. However,
despite these advances, generalizability still remains insufficient for
practical deployment. Inspired by neural radiance fields (NeRF), which learn a
volumetric representation of a 3D scene from 2D images, this work proposes a
novel approach to reconstruct an informative 3D latent motion representation
from one-dimensional Doppler velocity projections extracted from Wi-Fi CSI. The
resulting latent representation is then used to construct a uniform Doppler
radiance field (DoRF) of the motion, providing a comprehensive view of the
performed activity and improving the robustness to environmental variability.
The results show that the proposed approach noticeably enhances the
generalization accuracy of Wi-Fi-based HAR, highlighting the strong potential
of DoRFs for practical sensing applications.

*Carl Collmann,Bitan Banerjee,Ahmad Nimr,Gerhard Fettweis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对USRP X310系列SDR设备的实用相位噪声建模方法，解决了MIMO系统中相位噪声对性能影响的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIMO系统中相位噪声会显著降低性能，尤其是需要相位同步的应用，但目前SDR设备的相位噪声数据不足，缺乏系统性测量和建模。

Method: 通过测量数据，提取关键PLL性能指标，并构建相位噪声PSD的参数化模型。

Result: 提出了PLL电路的相位噪声PSD模型及参数估计，可用于分析类似SDR设备在MIMO系统中的相位噪声影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为MIMO系统性能分析提供了实用的相位噪声建模工具。

Abstract: In MIMO systems, the presence of phase noise is a significant factor that can
degrade performance. For MIMO testbeds build from SDR devices, phase noise
cannot be ignored, particular in applications that require phase
synchronization. This is especially relevant in MIMO systems that employ
digital beamforming, where precise phase alignment is crucial. Accordingly,
accurate phase noise modelling of SDR devices is essential. However, the
information provided in data sheets for different SDR models varies widely and
is often insufficient for comprehensive characterization of their phase noise
performance. While numerical simulations of PLL phase noise behavior are
documented in the literature, there is a lack of extensive measurements
supported by appropriate system modelling. In this work, we present a practical
phase noise modeling methodology applied to an SDR from the USRP X310 series.
Based on measurement data, we derive estimates of key PLL performance
indicators such as cycle-to-cycle jitter, oscillator constants, and PLL
bandwidth. Furthermore, we propose a parametric model for the phase noise PSD
of the PLL circuit and provide corresponding parameter estimates. This model
can be used for further investigation into the impact of phase noise on MIMO
system performance implemented by similar SDR devices.

### [10] [PAPR of DFT-s-OTFS with Pulse Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12210)
*Jialiang Zhu,Sanoopkumar P. S.,Arman Farhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 针对OTFS在高多普勒箱数时的高PAPR问题，采用DFT-s-OTFS方案，分析了不同脉冲整形和资源分配策略对PAPR的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决OTFS在高多普勒箱数时PAPR过高的问题，优化系统性能。

Method: 应用DFT扩展跨越多普勒维度，分析DFT-s-OTFS在上行链路中的PAPR，并比较不同资源分配策略和脉冲整形滤波器。

Result: 交错分配比块分配具有更低的PAPR，且RRC脉冲的最大PAPR高于矩形脉冲。

Conclusion: DFT-s-OTFS保持与OTFS相同的BER性能，同时有效降低了PAPR。

Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) suffers from high peak-to-average
power ratio (PAPR) when the number of Doppler bins is large. To address this
issue, a discrete Fourier transform spread OTFS (DFT-s-OTFS) scheme is employed
by applying DFT spreading across the Doppler dimension. This paper presents a
thorough PAPR analysis of DFT-s-OTFS in the uplink scenario using different
pulse shaping filters and resource allocation strategies. Specifically, we
derive a PAPR upper bound of DFT-s-OTFS with interleaved and block Doppler
resource allocation schemes. Our analysis reveals that DFT-s-OTFS with
interleaved allocation yields a lower PAPR than that of block allocation.
Furthermore, we show that interleaved allocation produces a periodic
time-domain signal composed of repeated quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM)
symbols which simplifies the transmitter design. Based on our analytical
results, the root raised cosine (RRC) pulse generally results in a higher
maximum PAPR compared to the rectangular pulse. Simulation results confirm the
validity of the derived PAPR upper bounds. Furthermore, we also demonstrate
through BER simulation analysis that the DFT-s-OTFS gives the same performance
as OTFS without DFT spreading.

Abstract: This work presents a passive sensing system for traffic monitoring using
ambient Long Term Evolution (LTE) signals as a non-intrusive and scalable
alternative to traditional surveillance methods. The approach employs a
dual-receiver architecture analyzing Channel State Information (CSI) to isolate
differential Doppler shifts induced by moving targets, effectively mitigating
hardware-induced phase impairments. Implemented with a Software Defined Radio
(SDR) platform and srsRAN software, the system demonstrated over 90% detection
accuracy for speeds above 6000 mm/min in controlled indoor tests, and provided
reliable speed estimations for pedestrians and vehicles in outdoor evaluations.
Despite challenges at low speeds, directional ambiguity, and multipath fading

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进传感系统和3GPP信道模型提供了重要依据，尤其是对6G ISAC技术的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation on the Radar Cross-Section (RCS) of
various targets, with the objective of analysing how RCS properties vary with
frequency. Targets such as an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV), a pedestrian, and
a full-scale car were measured in the frequency bands referred to in industry
standards as FR2 and FR3. Measurements were taken in diverse environments,
indoors and outdoors, to ensure comprehensive scenario coverage. The
methodology employed in RCS extraction performs background subtraction,
followed by time-domain gating to isolate the influence of the target. This
analysis compares the RCS values and how the points of greatest contribution
are distributed across different bands based on the range response of the RCS.
Analysis of the results demonstrated how RCS values change with frequency and
target shape, providing insights into the electromagnetic behaviour of these
targets. Key findings highlight how much scaling RCS values based on frequency
and geometry is complex and varies among different types of materials and
shapes. These insights are instrumental for advancing sensing systems and
enhancing 3GPP channel models, particularly for Integrated Sensing and
Communications (ISAC) techniques proposed for 6G standards.

Conclusion: Dual-ImRUNet显著提升了超低速率CSI反馈的性能和环境适应性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based implicit channel state information (CSI) feedback has
been introduced to enhance spectral efficiency in massive MIMO systems.
Existing methods often show performance degradation in ultra-low-rate scenarios
and inadaptability across diverse environments. In this paper, we propose
Dual-ImRUNet, an efficient uplink-assisted deep implicit CSI feedback framework
incorporating two novel plug-in preprocessing modules to achieve ultra-low
feedback rates while maintaining high environmental robustness. First, a novel
bi-directional correlation enhancement module is proposed to strengthen the
correlation between uplink and downlink CSI eigenvector matrices. This module
projects highly correlated uplink and downlink channel matrices into their
respective eigenspaces, effectively reducing redundancy for ultra-low-rate
feedback. Second, an innovative input format alignment module is designed to
maintain consistent data distributions at both encoder and decoder sides
without extra transmission overhead, thereby enhancing robustness against
environmental variations. Finally, we develop an efficient transformer-based
implicit CSI feedback network to exploit angular-delay domain sparsity and
bi-directional correlation for ultra-low-rate CSI compression. Simulation
results demonstrate successful reduction of the feedback overhead by 85%
compared with the state-of-the-art method and robustness against unseen
environments.

Abstract: Road roughness significantly affects vehicle vibrations and ride quality. We
introduce a Kalman filter (KF)-based method for estimating road roughness in
terms of the international roughness index (IRI) by fusing inertial and speed

method involves system identification on a physical vehicle to estimate
realistic model parameters, followed by KF-based reconstruction of the
longitudinal road profile to compute IRI values. It explores IRI estimation
using vertical and lateral vibrations, the latter more common in modern
vehicles. Validation on 230 km of real-world data shows promising results, with
IRI estimation errors ranging from 1% to 10% of the reference values. However,
accuracy deteriorates significantly when using only lateral vibrations,
highlighting their limitations. These findings demonstrate the potential of
KF-based estimation for efficient road roughness monitoring.

Abstract: Compared to the conventional centralized multichannel active noise control
(MCANC) algorithm, which requires substantial computational resources,
decentralized approaches exhibit higher computational efficiency but typically
result in inferior noise reduction performance. To enhance performance,
distributed ANC methods have been introduced, enabling information exchange
among ANC nodes; however, the resulting communication latency often compromises
system stability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-boosted
weight-constrained filtered-reference least mean square (SB-WCFxLMS) algorithm
for the distributed MCANC system without internode communication. The WCFxLMS
algorithm is specifically designed to mitigate divergence issues caused by the
internode cross-talk effect. The self-boosted strategy lets each ANC node
independently adapt its constraint parameters based on its local noise
reduction performance, thus ensuring effective noise cancellation without the
need for inter-node communication. With the assistance of this mechanism, this
approach significantly reduces both computational complexity and communication
overhead. Numerical simulations employing real acoustic paths and compressor
noise validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system. The
results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves satisfactory noise
cancellation performance with minimal resource requirements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于软约束的空间选择性主动噪声控制系统，通过在噪声减少和语音失真之间引入权衡参数，显著提升了语音质量和信噪比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统硬约束方法在空间选择性主动噪声控制（SSANC）中可能导致语音失真，因此需要一种更灵活的方法来平衡噪声减少与语音保真度。

Method: 设计了软约束SSANC系统，通过频率无关参数在噪声减少和语音失真之间进行权衡，并推导了时域和频域公式。

Result: 仿真实验中，软约束系统在信噪比、语音质量（PESQ）和可懂度（ESTOI）方面均优于硬约束设计。

Conclusion: 软约束SSANC系统在多种权衡参数下均表现出优越性能，为噪声控制提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in spatially selective active noise control (SSANC) using
multiple microphones have enabled hearables to suppress undesired noise while
preserving desired speech from a specific direction. Aiming to achieve minimal
speech distortion, a hard constraint has been used in previous work in the
optimization problem to compute the control filter. In this work, we propose a
soft-constrained SSANC system that uses a frequency-independent parameter to
trade off between speech distortion and noise reduction. We derive both time-
and frequency-domain formulations, and show that conventional active noise
control and hard-constrained SSANC represent two limiting cases of the proposed
design. We evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting
hearables in an anechoic environment with one speech source and two noise
sources. The simulation results validate the theoretical derivations and
demonstrate that for a broad range of the trade-off parameter, the
signal-to-noise ratio and the speech quality and intelligibility in terms of
PESQ and ESTOI can be substantially improved compared to the hard-constrained
design.

Motivation: 探究人类大脑在被动体验中如何自发构建精细的空间表征，突破传统主动与被动空间认知的界限。

Method: 使用EEG-based BCI解码被试在观看自中心视频时的自发6D姿态（位置+方向），并通过梯度回传分析神经解码模型。

Conclusion: 大脑空间系统在被动条件下持续运作，为理解感官经验如何转化为内部空间表征提供了非侵入性窗口。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for
self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal
neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale
neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during
naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we
demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous,
fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and
orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited
spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent
visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable
spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of
spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is
presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with
intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation
through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing
to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed
yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the
brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under
passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and
passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the
automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding
of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured
internal representations.

Conclusion: 研究为理解贝叶斯估计器在低秩信号恢复中的性能提供了理论支持，特别是在参数失配情况下的表现。

Abstract: We investigate the performance of a Bayesian statistician tasked with
recovering a rank-\(k\) signal matrix \(\bS \bS^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times
n}\), corrupted by element-wise additive Gaussian noise. This problem lies at
the core of numerous applications in machine learning, signal processing, and
statistics. We derive an analytic expression for the asymptotic mean-square
error (MSE) of the Bayesian estimator under mismatches in the assumed signal
rank, signal power, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), considering both sphere
and Gaussian signals. Additionally, we conduct a rigorous analysis of how rank
mismatch influences the asymptotic MSE. Our primary technical tools include the
spectrum of Gaussian orthogonal ensembles (GOE) with low-rank perturbations and
asymptotic behavior of \(k\)-dimensional spherical integrals.

Abstract: Sound speed profiles (SSPs) are essential parameters underwater that affects
the propagation mode of underwater signals and has a critical impact on the
energy efficiency of underwater acoustic communication and accuracy of
underwater acoustic positioning. Traditionally, SSPs can be obtained by
matching field processing (MFP), compressive sensing (CS), and deep learning
(DL) methods. However, existing methods mainly rely on on-site underwater sonar
observation data, which put forward strict requirements on the deployment of
sonar observation systems. To achieve high-precision estimation of sound
velocity distribution in a given sea area without on-site underwater data
measurement, we propose a multi-modal data-fusion generative adversarial
network model with residual attention block (MDF-RAGAN) for SSP construction.
To improve the model's ability for capturing global spatial feature
correlations, we embedded the attention mechanisms, and use residual modules
for deeply capturing small disturbances in the deep ocean sound velocity
distribution caused by changes of SST. Experimental results on real open
dataset show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods, which achieves an accuracy with an error of less than 0.3m/s.
Specifically, MDF-RAGAN not only outperforms convolutional neural network (CNN)
and spatial interpolation (SITP) by nearly a factor of two, but also achieves
about 65.8\% root mean square error (RMSE) reduction compared to mean profile,
which fully reflects the enhancement of overall profile matching by
multi-source fusion and cross-modal attention.
