### [1] [Near-Field Beamfocusing, Localization, and Channel Estimation with Modular Linear Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07991)
*Alva Kosasih,Özlem Tuğfe Demir,Emil Björnson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究如何利用模块化线性阵列（MLA）实现近场波束聚焦，通过多组宽间距均匀线性阵（ULA）扩展孔径而不增加天线数量，提升多用户复用增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统远场波束成形无法在相同角度区间内为不同距离用户同时传输数据，MLA架构通过近场波束聚焦解决了这一问题。

Method: 通过数学分析MLA的波束宽度和深度，优化子ULA的天线数量，并提出高效定位方法融合多组ULA的估计。

Result: 仿真验证了理论分析的准确性，MLA能以较少天线实现近场波束聚焦，适用于下一代无线系统。

Conclusion: MLA是高效且低复杂度的近场波束聚焦解决方案，显著提升多用户复用能力。

Abstract: This paper investigates how near-field beamfocusing can be achieved using a
modular linear array (MLA), composed of multiple widely spaced uniform linear
arrays (ULAs). The MLA architecture extends the aperture length of a standard
ULA without adding additional antennas, thereby enabling near-field
beamfocusing without increasing processing complexity. Unlike conventional
far-field beamforming, near-field beamfocusing enables simultaneous data
transmission to multiple users at different distances in the same angular
interval, offering significant multiplexing gains. We present a detailed
mathematical analysis of the beamwidth and beamdepth achievable with the MLA
and show that by appropriately selecting the number of antennas in each
constituent ULA, ideal near-field beamfocusing can be realized. In addition, we
propose a computationally efficient localization method that fuses estimates
from each ULA, enabling efficient parametric channel estimation. Simulation
results confirm the accuracy of the analytical expressions and that MLAs
achieve near-field beamfocusing with a limited number of antennas, making them
a promising solution for next-generation wireless systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了多卫星大规模MIMO传输中的分布式预编码设计，提出了基于协方差分解的WMMSE方法和低复杂度深度学习方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的WMMSE方法在多卫星场景下无法保持等效性，因此需要新的方法来解决预编码设计问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的方法在动态场景下具有有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在多卫星大规模MIMO传输中表现优异，能够适应动态环境。

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of distributed precoding for
multi-satellite massive MIMO transmissions. We first conduct a detailed
analysis of the transceiver model, in which delay and Doppler precompensation
is introduced to ensure coherent transmission. In this analysis, we examine the
impact of precompensation errors on the transmission model, emphasize the
near-independence of inter-satellite interference, and ultimately derive the
received signal model. Based on such signal model, we formulate an approximate
expected rate maximization problem that considers both statistical channel
state information (sCSI) and compensation errors. Unlike conventional
approaches that recast such problems as weighted minimum mean square error
(WMMSE) minimization, we demonstrate that this transformation fails to maintain
equivalence in the considered scenario. To address this, we introduce an
equivalent covariance decomposition-based WMMSE (CDWMMSE) formulation derived
based on channel covariance matrix decomposition. Taking advantage of the
channel characteristics, we develop a low-complexity decomposition method and
propose an optimization algorithm. To further reduce computational complexity,
we introduce a model-driven scalable deep learning (DL) approach that leverages
the equivariance of the mapping from sCSI to the unknown variables in the
optimal closed-form solution, enhancing performance through novel dense
Transformer network and scaling-invariant loss function design. Simulation
results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in
some practical scenarios. We also demonstrate that the DL approach can adapt to
dynamic settings with varying numbers of users and satellites.

### [3] [Zak-OTFS for Spread Spectrum Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08079)
*Nishant Mehrotra,Sandesh Rao Mattu,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将Zak-OTFS调制转换为扩频通信系统的方法，通过广义离散仿射傅里叶变换生成低PAPR的波形，匹配6G无线信道的延迟和多普勒特性，性能与基于pulsone的Zak-OTFS相当且PAPR仅为3.58 dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线标准中，正交频分调制取代CDMA后信号更难被拦截或干扰的特性丢失。传统扩频波形不匹配6G环境的延迟和多普勒特性，导致均衡困难。Zak-OTFS在延迟-多普勒域参数化信道，能高效获取和均衡信道，但pulsone波形存在高PAPR问题。因此，研究如何将Zak-OTFS转换为扩频系统，以保留低PAPR并匹配信道特性。

Method: 提出一种广义离散仿射傅里叶变换，将Zak-OTFS中的pulsone波形转换为时域波形，生成CAZAC序列（如5G中的Zadoff-Chu序列）。通过时间域收发信号处理（包括信道估计和数据解调）实现扩频系统。

Result: 在六路径Veh-A信道模型下的BER仿真表明，所提系统的误码率与基于pulsone的Zak-OTFS相当，且每个扩频波形的PAPR仅为3.58 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将Zak-OTFS转换为低PAPR的扩频系统，不仅保留了抗干扰特性，还匹配6G信道特性，为未来无线通信提供新方向。

Abstract: An attractive feature of spread spectrum technologies such as code division
multiple access (CDMA) is that it is harder to intercept or jam signals, and
this feature was lost when orthogonal frequency domain modulation prevailed
over CDMA in wireless standards. Legacy spread carrier waveforms are not
matched to delay and Doppler shifts characteristic of 6G wireless environments,
and this makes equalization very challenging. Zak-OTFS modulation is a
communication framework that parameterizes the wireless channel in the
delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the parameters map directly to physical
attributes of the scatterers that comprise the scattering environment. Hence,
the channel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. The Zak-OTFS carrier is
a pulse in the DD domain, and the Zak transform converts it to a pulse train
modulated by a tone (pulsone) in the time domain. The pulsone waveform is
localized rather than spread, and it suffers from high PAPR. We describe how to
transform Zak-OTFS into a spread spectrum communication system, where the
spread carrier waveforms have low PAPR and are matched to the delay and Doppler
characteristics of the wireless channel. This transformation is realized by a
unitary transform that is a generalization of the discrete affine Fourier
transform. The transform maps a pulsone to a time domain waveform which yields
a CAZAC sequence after sampling. The family of CAZAC sequences includes the
Zadoff-Chu sequences incorporated in LTE and 5G-NR standards. We describe the
end-to-end time-domain transceiver signal processing, comprising channel
estimation and data demodulation, for the proposed system. We quantify system
performance through BER simulations using a six-path Veh-A channel model,
showing that the proposed system achieves similar uncoded BER as pulsone-based
Zak-OTFS, where the PAPR of each spread carrier waveform is only 3.58 dB.

### [4] [Performance Analysis of Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08221)
*Dongsheng Sui,Cunhua Pan,Hong Ren,Jiahua Wan,Liuchang Zhuo,Jing Jin,Qixing Wang,Jiangzhou Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文引入随机几何框架分析协同ISAC网络性能，推导出通信和感知域的关键性能指标表达式，并通过仿真验证理论分析。结果表明，增加协作基站数量显著提升性能，而基站密度和天线数量的增加效果有限或有递减效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究协同ISAC网络的性能与其参数之间的关系，为网络部署和设计提供理论依据。

Method: 提出基于随机几何的框架建模网络部署，推导通信覆盖概率和雷达信息率的解析表达式，并通过蒙特卡洛仿真验证。

Result: 增加协作基站数显著提升性能；基站密度对通信覆盖影响有限但能大幅提升雷达信息率；天线数量增加在小规模时有效，但增益递减。

Conclusion: 协同ISAC网络的性能优化需权衡参数设计，盲目增加天线或基站密度并非高效策略。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to effectively characterize the performance of
cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks and to reveal
how performance metrics relate to network parameters. To this end, we introduce
a generalized stochastic geometry framework to model the cooperative ISAC
networks, which approximates the spatial randomness of the network deployment.
Based on this framework, we derive analytical expressions for key performance
metrics in both communication and sensing domains, with a particular focus on
communication coverage probability and radar information rate. The analytical
expressions derived explicitly highlight how performance metrics depend on
network parameters, thereby offering valuable insights into the deployment and
design of cooperative ISAC networks. In the end, we validate the theoretical
performance analysis through Monte Carlo simulation results. Our results
demonstrate that increasing the number of cooperative base stations (BSs)
significantly improves both metrics, while increasing the BS deployment density
has a limited impact on communication coverage probability but substantially
enhances the radar information rate. Additionally, increasing the number of
transmit antennas is effective when the total number of transmit antennas is
relatively small. The incremental performance gain reduces with the increase of
the number of transmit antennas, suggesting that indiscriminately increasing
antennas is not an efficient strategy to improve the performance of the system
in cooperative ISAC networks.

### [5] [N$^2$LoS: Single-Tag mmWave Backscatter for Robust Non-Line-of-Sight Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08240)
*Zhenguo Shi,Yihe Yan,Yanxiang Wang,Wen Hu,Chun Tung Chou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为N2LoS的新型非视距（NLoS）定位方法，通过单毫米波雷达和反向散射标签实现高精度定位，利用多径反射提高定位准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统定位方法在直射路径被阻挡时精度显著下降，N2LoS旨在解决这一问题，通过利用多径反射实现精确的NLoS定位。

Method: N2LoS设计了HFD技术以区分反射体和目标，通过信号设计提升信噪比，并提出FS-MUSIC算法扩展传统MUSIC方法，以解析更多的多径成分。

Result: 在实验环境中，N2LoS在5米范围内的定位误差中位数分别为X轴10.69厘米和Y轴11.98厘米，展现了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: N2LoS通过创新技术实现了高精度的NLoS定位，为复杂环境中的定位问题提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The accuracy of traditional localization methods significantly degrades when
the direct path between the wireless transmitter and the target is blocked or
non-penetrable. This paper proposes N2LoS, a novel approach for precise
non-line-of-sight (NLoS) localization using a single mmWave radar and a
backscatter tag. N2LoS leverages multipath reflections from both the tag and
surrounding reflectors to accurately estimate the targets position. N2LoS
introduces several key innovations. First, we design HFD (Hybrid
Frequency-Hopping and Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) to detect and
differentiate reflectors from the target. Second, we enhance signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) by exploiting the correlation properties of the designed signals,
improving detection robustness in complex environments. Third, we propose
FS-MUSIC (Frequency-Spatial Multiple Signal Classification), a super resolution
algorithm that extends the traditional MUSIC method by constructing a
higher-rank signal matrix, enabling the resolution of additional multipath
components. We evaluate N2LoS using a 24 GHz mmWave radar with 250 MHz
bandwidth in three diverse environments: a laboratory, an office, and an
around-the-corner corridor. Experimental results demonstrate that N2LoS
achieves median localization errors of 10.69 cm (X) and 11.98 cm (Y) at a 5 m
range in the laboratory setting, showcasing its effectiveness for real-world
NLoS localization.

### [6] [Sparsity-Aware Near-Field Beam Training via Multi-Beam Combination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08267)
*Zijun Wang,Rama Kiran,Jinesh Nair,Chien-Hua Chen,Tzu-Han Chou,Shawn Tsai,Rui Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出一种自适应近场波束训练方法，通过波束扫描和多信号线性组合提升多用户多路径环境下的性能，利用近场码本和LASSO回归显著降低反馈开销并提升抗噪鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多用户和多路径环境下的波束训练性能不足，传统方法（如DFT码本）无法高效捕捉近场信道的距离和角度信息，亟需更有效的自适应方法。

Method: 1. 波束扫描识别最强波束；2. 线性组合接收信号（含幅相）；3. 使用DFT码本和近场码本；4. 通过LASSO回归利用稀疏性抑制噪声；5. 引入离网细化提升粗采样精度。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著优化了近场波束训练的效率与精度，尤其适用于复杂信道环境。

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive near-field beam training method to enhance
performance in multi-user and multipath environments. The approach identifies
multiple strongest beams through beam sweeping and linearly combines their
received signals - capturing both amplitude and phase - for improved channel
estimation. Two codebooks are considered: the conventional DFT codebook and a
near-field codebook that samples both angular and distance domains. As the
near-field basis functions are generally non-orthogonal and often
over-complete, we exploit sparsity in the solution using LASSO-based linear
regression, which can also suppress noise. Simulation results show that the
near-field codebook reduces feedback overhead by up to 95% compared to the DFT
codebook. The proposed LASSO regression method also maintains robustness under
varying noise levels, particularly in low SNR regions. Furthermore, an off-grid
refinement scheme is introduced to enhance accuracy especially when the
codebook sampling is coarse, improving reconstruction accuracy by 69.4%.

### [7] [Multi-Active RIS-Assisted THz Cell-Free Systems: Spectral and Energy Efficiency Tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08287)
*Mario R. Camana,Zaid Abdullah,Carla E. Garcia,Chandan Kumar Sheemar,Eva Lagunas,Symeon Chatzinotas*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多主动RIS辅助的宽带CF-mMIMO系统在THz通信中的应用，通过调整预编码向量和RIS反射系数优化SE-EE权衡，解决了高复杂度的非凸多目标分数优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的被动RIS在THz系统中存在双衰落衰减的局限性，主动RIS通过功率放大提高信号强度，而低分辨率DAC的集成则有望进一步提升能效。

Method: 提出了一种定制的二次变换方法处理分数形式问题，将其分解为两个子问题，并通过逐次凸逼近算法迭代优化预编码向量和主动RIS反射系数。

Result: 数值结果表明，主动RIS辅助的CF-mMIMO系统能够有效应对THz通信中的传播损耗和有限散射问题，在EE和SE上均优于传统被动RIS。

Conclusion: 主动RIS结合低分辨率DAC在THz通信中展现出优越性能，既提升能效又保持良好的通信质量。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and cell-free massive
multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) are effective solutions for
mitigating large path loss and inter-cell interference in terahertz (THz)
systems. However, passive RISs are notably limited from double-fading
attenuation, motivating the use of active RISs with power amplification to
improve signal strength. In this paper, we investigate a multi-active RIS-aided
wideband CF-mMIMO system for THz communications, considering low-resolution
digital-to-analog converters (DACs) to optimize the spectral efficiency
(SE)-energy efficiency (EE) tradeoff by adjusting precoding vectors and
reflection coefficient response of the RISs, subject to power and minimum
desirable per-user rate constraints. This leads to a highly complex and
non-convex, multi-objective and fractional optimization problem. To solve it,
we propose a tailored quadratic transformation to manage the fractional form.
This allows decomposition into two subproblems, which are iteratively solved
via a successive convex approximation algorithm to optimize the precoding
vectors and active RIS reflection coefficients until convergence. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed active RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system
effectively addresses propagation loss and limited scattering in THz
communication, achieving superior EE and SE compared to conventional passive
RIS across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, the integration of low-resolution
DACs shows significant improvement in EE while preserving satisfactory
communication performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法未充分利用CSI与其他信道指标的语义关系，限制了CSI反馈的性能提升。

Method: 提出SemCSINet框架，结合CQI信息和联合编码调制方案，优化CSI反馈过程。

Result: 在DeepMIMO数据集上的实验表明，SemCSINet在低SNR和低CR场景下显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效提升CSI重建精度和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is a key enabler of
modern wireless communication systems, which demand accurate downlink channel
state information (CSI) for optimal performance. Although deep learning (DL)
has shown great potential in improving CSI feedback, most existing approaches
fail to exploit the semantic relationship between CSI and other related channel
metrics. In this paper, we propose SemCSINet, a semantic-aware
Transformer-based framework that incorporates Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)
into the CSI feedback process. By embedding CQI information and leveraging a
joint coding-modulation (JCM) scheme, SemCSINet enables efficient,
digital-friendly CSI feedback under noisy feedback channels. Experimental
results on DeepMIMO datasets show that SemCSINet significantly outperforms
conventional methods, particularly in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and low compression ratios (CRs), highlighting the effectiveness of
semantic embedding in enhancing CSI reconstruction accuracy and system
robustness.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的DC偏移校准方法和HADCM解调算法，用于复杂环境下的毫米波雷达生命体征检测，提高了信号恢复的准确性和抗噪声能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境中，时变的DC偏移和相位不平衡会严重影响毫米波雷达生命体征检测的解调性能，需要一种更鲁棒的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 通过从邻近信号峰谷估计时变DC偏移，并结合I/Q通道信号的差分形式和希尔伯特变换来提取生命体征信息，提出了DC偏移校准与HADCM解调算法。

Result: 仿真和实验结果表明，该方法在低信噪比下仍保持鲁棒性，相比现有技术，在复杂场景中能更准确地恢复信号并有效抑制噪声干扰。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著提升了复杂环境下毫米波雷达生命体征检测的解调性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate phase demodulation is critical for vital sign detection using
millimeter-wave radar. However, in complex environments, time-varying DC
offsets and phase imbalances can severely degrade demodulation performance. To
address this, we propose a novel DC offset calibration method alongside a
Hilbert and Differential Cross-Multiply (HADCM) demodulation algorithm. The
approach estimates time-varying DC offsets from neighboring signal peaks and
valleys, then employs both differential forms and Hilbert transforms of the I/Q
channel signals to extract vital sign information. Simulation and experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains robust performance under
low signal-to-noise ratios. Compared to existing demodulation techniques, it
offers more accurate signal recovery in challenging scenarios and effectively
suppresses noise interference.

Abstract: This paper investigates the secrecy performance of satellite networks in
short packet communication systems under shadowed Rician fading (SRF). We
derive a lower bound on the average achievable secrecy rate in the finite
blocklength regime (FBL) and provide analytical insights into the impact of key
secrecy-related performance indicators (KPIs). Monte Carlo simulations validate
the theoretical framework, and demonstrate that increasing the blocklength and
improving the legitimate receiver's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhance
secrecy, while a stronger eavesdropper degrades it. Additionally, we show that
directional antenna patterns can effectively reduce information leakage and
provide secure satellite communications in the short packet regime. These
findings offer valuable guidance for designing secure and efficient
satellite-based communication systems, particularly in IoT and space-based
networks.

Result: 实验表明，该方案在误块率（BLER）、语义指标和解码延迟上均优于传统长LDPC编码。语义HARQ进一步提升了纠错性能。

Conclusion: 语义增强解码结合短码并行传输及语义驱动重传，为噪声信道下的自然语言通信提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel semantic-enhanced decoding scheme for
transmitting natural language sentences with multiple short block codes over
noisy wireless channels. After ASCII source coding, the natural language
sentence message is divided into segments, where each is encoded with short
block channel codes independently before transmission. At the receiver, each
short block of codewords is decoded in parallel, followed by a semantic error
correction (SEC) model to reconstruct corrupted segments semantically. We
design and train the SEC model based on Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive
Transformers (BART). Simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can
significantly outperform encoding the sentence with one conventional long LDPC
code, in terms of block error rate (BLER), semantic metrics, and decoding
latency. Finally, we proposed a semantic hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)
scheme to further enhance the error performance, which selectively requests
retransmission depends on semantic uncertainty.

Conclusion: 论文证明了通过提取LAMs的核心能力并剔除冗余，将其整合到无线系统中的可行性为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large AI models (LAMs) have shown strong potential in wireless communication
tasks, but their practical deployment remains hindered by latency and
computational constraints. In this work, we focus on the challenge of
integrating LAMs into channel state information (CSI) feedback for
frequency-division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-intput multiple-output (MIMO)
systems. To this end, we propose two offline frameworks, namely site-specific
LAM-enhanced CSI feedback (SSLCF) and multi-scenario LAM-enhanced CSI feedback
(MSLCF), that incorporate LAMs into the codebook-based CSI feedback paradigm
without requiring real-time inference. Specifically, SSLCF generates a
site-specific enhanced codebook through fine-tuning on locally collected CSI
data, while MSLCF improves generalization by pre-generating a set of
environment-aware codebooks. Both of these frameworks build upon the LAM with
vision-based backbone, which is pre-trained on large-scale image datasets and
fine-tuned with CSI data to generate customized codebooks. This resulting
network named LVM4CF captures the structural similarity between CSI and image,
allowing the LAM to refine codewords tailored to the specific environments. To
optimize the codebook refinement capability of LVM4CF under both single- and
dual-side deployment modes, we further propose corresponding training and
inference algorithms. Simulation results show that our frameworks significantly
outperform existing schemes in both reconstruction accuracy and system
throughput, without introducing additional inference latency or computational
overhead. These results also support the core design methodology of our
proposed frameworks, extracting the best and discarding the rest, as a
promising pathway for integrating LAMs into future wireless systems.

*Jonggyu Jang,Hyeonsu Lyu,David J. Love,Hyun Jong Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种异构alpha公平性(HAF)目标函数，通过为用户分配不同的alpha值，优化无线网络中的用户关联和资源分配问题，实现了分布式定价算法的收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代无线网络日益密集且用户需求多样，传统的同质公平性假设无法满足实际需求，需差异化用户优先级以平衡吞吐量、公平性和延迟。

Method: 采用分布式定价策略和辅助变量框架，提出异构alpha公平性目标函数，并为算法提供收敛性证明。

Result: 算法能收敛至ε最优解，优化间隙随迭代次数减少，有效平衡了网络性能与用户公平性。

Conclusion: 异构alpha公平性框架为无线网络提供了更灵活的资源分配方案，适用于多样化用户需求。

Abstract: User association, the problem of assigning each user device to a suitable
base station, is increasingly crucial as wireless networks become denser and
serve more users with diverse service demands. The joint optimization of user
association and resource allocation (UARA) is a fundamental issue for future
wireless networks, as it plays a pivotal role in enhancing overall network
performance, user fairness, and resource efficiency. Given the
latency-sensitive nature of emerging network applications, network management
favors algorithms that are simple and computationally efficient rather than
complex centralized approaches. Thus, distributed pricing-based strategies have
gained prominence in the UARA literature, demonstrating practicality and
effectiveness across various objective functions, e.g., sum-rate, proportional
fairness, max-min fairness, and alpha-fairness. While the alpha-fairness
frameworks allow for flexible adjustments between efficiency and fairness via a
single parameter $\alpha$, existing works predominantly assume a homogeneous
fairness context, assigning an identical $\alpha$ value to all users.
Real-world networks, however, frequently require differentiated user
prioritization due to varying application requirements and latency. To bridge
this gap, we propose a novel heterogeneous alpha-fairness (HAF) objective
function, assigning distinct {\alpha} values to different users, thereby
providing enhanced control over the balance between throughput, fairness, and
latency across the network. We present a distributed, pricing-based
optimization approach utilizing an auxiliary variable framework and provide
analytical proof of its convergence to an $\epsilon$-optimal solution, where
the optimality gap $\epsilon$ decreases with the number of iterations.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the robust beamforming design for a
simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface
(STAR-RIS) aided downlink rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) communication
system, where both transceivers and STAR-RIS suffer from the impact of hardware
impairments (HWI). A base station (BS) is deployed to transmit messages
concurrently to multiple users, utilizing a STAR-RIS to improve communication
quality and expand user coverage. We aim to maximize the achievable sum rate of
the users while ensuring the constraints of transmit power, STAR-RIS
coefficients, and the actual rate of the common stream for all users. To solve
this challenging high-coupling and non-convexity problem, we adopt a fractional
programming (FP)-based alternating optimization (AO) approach, where each
sub-problem is addressed via semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive
convex approximation (SCA) methods. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme outperforms other multiple access schemes and conventional
passive RIS in terms of the achievable sum rate. Additionally, considering the
HWI of the transceiver and STAR-RIS makes our algorithm more robust than when
such considerations are not included.

TL;DR: 该论文通过25-28 GHz频段的测量，验证了3GPP标准化的对数正态分布模型对室内工厂（InF）中无人机、机械臂等目标的雷达散射截面（RCS）特性，数据与标准值接近，同时发现不同尺寸和材料的RCS行为差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在为InF环境中的集成传感与通信信道建模提供RCS特性的实验验证，以支持5G及未来通信技术的标准化与实际应用。

Method: 采用3GPP标准方法，在25-28 GHz频段对小型和中型无人机、机械臂及自动导引车进行RCS测量，并与3GPP模型进行比较。

Result: 小型无人机的RCS参数与3GPP标准值偏差小于1 dB；中型无人机因材料和电池组反射性更强；机械臂因机械运动呈现动态RCS行为。

Conclusion: 实验结果支持3GPP标准模型在InF场景中的适用性，并为通信与传感一体化设计提供了数据基础。

Abstract: The following paper presents a systematic 3rd Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP)-compliant characterization of radar cross section (RCS) for indoor
factory (InF) objects, including small and mid-sized unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs), robotic arms, and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). Through
measurements in the 25-28 GHz range, we validate the 3GPP standardized
log-normal distribution model for RCS for above-mentioned target objects. The
3GPP-complaint RCS parameters obtained for the small-sized UAV are in close
agreement (<1 dB deviation) with 3GPP agreed values. The mid-sized UAVs exhibit
higher reflectivity compared to the small-sized UAV due to enhanced specular
components attributed to material and lithium-ion battery packs. The robotic
arm exhibits dynamic RCS behavior due to mechanical articulation, whereas UAVs
show clear size-dependent reflectivity patterns in AGVs. Our findings provide
empirical validation for RCS characterization for integrated sensing and
communication channel modeling in InF environments.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于图神经网络（GNN）的无细胞大规模MIMO预编码方法，通过在模拟数据上预训练模型并在真实数据上微调，显著提升了性能，证明了迁移学习的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决分布式系统中预编码的挑战，并验证GNN方法在真实传播环境中的泛化能力。

Method: 先使用模拟信道状态信息（CSI）数据预训练GNN模型，接着在真实CSI数据上通过层冻结策略进行微调。

Result: 微调后的GNN在20 dB信噪比下实现了约8.2比特每信道使用的增益，比预训练模型提升了15.7%。

Conclusion: 研究表明迁移学习和GNN技术能有效将合成数据训练结果泛化到真实无线环境，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
delivering uniformly high-quality coverage in future wireless networks. To
address the inherent challenges of precoding in such distributed systems,
recent studies have explored the use of graph neural network (GNN)-based
methods, using their powerful representation capabilities. However, these
approaches have predominantly been trained and validated on synthetic datasets,
leaving their generalizability to real-world propagation environments largely
unverified. In this work, we initially pre-train the GNN using simulated
channel state information (CSI) data, which incorporates standard propagation
models and small-scale Rayleigh fading. Subsequently, we finetune the model on
real-world CSI measurements collected from a physical testbed equipped with
distributed access points (APs). To balance the retention of pre-trained
features with adaptation to real-world conditions, we adopt a layer-freezing
strategy during fine-tuning, wherein several GNN layers are frozen and only the
later layers remain trainable. Numerical results demonstrate that the
fine-tuned GNN significantly outperforms the pre-trained model, achieving an
approximate 8.2 bits per channel use gain at 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
corresponding to a 15.7 % improvement. These findings highlight the critical
role of transfer learning and underscore the potential of GNN-based precoding
techniques to effectively generalize from synthetic to real-world wireless
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过智能调整天线极化和机械位置/旋转，解决传统系统在极化多样性和空间多样性利用上的不足，以提升无线传感与通信的综合性能。

Method: 设计两时间尺度ISAC协议：慢时间尺度优化BS天线位置/旋转（基于用户定位），快时间尺度适配极化（基于CSI）。提出基于PARAFAC张量模型的极化定位方法，并联合优化极化和天线配置以最大化用户平均和速率。

Conclusion: IPA通过极化和机械调整的协同设计，显著改善了ISAC系统的传感与通信能力，验证了其在无线系统中的实用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent polarforming antenna (IPA) to
achieve cost-effective wireless sensing and communication. Specifically, the
IPA can enable polarforming by adaptively controlling the antenna's
polarization electrically as well as its position/rotation mechanically, so as
to effectively exploit polarization and spatial diversity to reconfigure
wireless channels for improving sensing and communication performance. We study
an IPA-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that
utilizes user location sensing to facilitate communication between an
IPA-equipped base station (BS) and IPA-equipped users. First, we model the IPA
channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming vectors and antenna
positions/rotations. We then propose a two-timescale ISAC protocol, where in
the slow timescale, user localization is first performed, followed by the
optimization of the BS antennas' positions and rotations based on the sensed
user locations; subsequently, in the fast timescale, transceiver polarforming
is adapted to cater to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), with
the optimized BS antennas' positions and rotations. We propose a new
polarforming-based user localization method that uses a structured time-domain
pattern of pilot-polarforming vectors to extract the common stable components
in the IPA channel across different polarizations based on the parallel factor
(PARAFAC) tensor model. Moreover, we maximize the achievable average sum-rate
of users by jointly optimizing the fast-timescale transceiver polarforming,
including phase shifts and amplitude variations, along with the slow-timescale
antenna rotations and positions at the BS. Simulation results validate the
effectiveness of polarforming-based localization algorithm and demonstrate the
performance advantages of polarforming, antenna placement, and their joint
design.

Conclusion: ARLCH算法在多用户MISO网络中显著提升了功率效率和可扩展性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are promising alternatives to fully
digital (FD) architectures, enabling hybrid beamforming via low-cost
reconfigurable metasurfaces. In DMAs, holographic beamforming is achieved
through tunable elements by Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH),
significantly reducing the need for radio-frequency (RF) chains and analog
circuitry. However, the Lorentzian constraints and limited RF chains introduce
a trade-off between reduced system complexity and beamforming performance,
especially in dense network scenarios. This paper addresses resource allocation
in multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MISO) networks under the
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints, aiming to minimize
total transmit power. We propose a holographic beamforming algorithm based on
the Generalized Method of Lorentzian-Constrained Holography (GMLCH), which
optimizes DMA weights, yielding flexibility for using various LCH techniques to
tackle the aforementioned trade-offs. Building upon GMLCH, we further propose a
new algorithm, Adaptive Radius Lorentzian Constrained Holography (ARLCH), which
achieves optimization of DMA weights with additional degree of freedom in a
greater optimization space, and provides lower transmitted power, while
improving scalability for higher number of users. Numerical results show that
ARLCH reduces power consumption by over 20% compared to benchmarks, with
increasing effectiveness as the number of users grows.

Abstract: This work studies a point-to-point MIMO uplink in which user equipment
transmits data to a base station equipped with a massive array. Signal
detection is noncoherent and fading is assumed to follow the Weichselberger
model. By exploiting the spatial stationarity of fading at the base station, a
cyclostationary structure emerges naturally in the space-time representation,
which suggests formulating the statistical properties of the received signal in
the Karhunen-Lo\`eve domain. This allows the derivation of a low-complexity
receiver that approximates maximum likelihood detection even for a moderate
array size. The spectral analysis of the problem provides valuable insights on
the design of space-time codewords.

Conclusion: 双无人机协作方案有效提升了安全通信和目标感知性能，为复杂非凸问题的优化提供了可行方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure
communication and sensing (SCS) scheme for an air-to-ground integrated sensing
and communication (ISAC) system, in which a dual-functional source UAV and
jamming UAV collaborate to enhance both the secure communication and target
sensing performance. From a perspective of hybrid monostatitc-bistatic radar,
the jamming UAV maneuvers to aid the source UAV to detect multiple ground
targets by emitting artificial noise, meanwhile interfering with the ground
eavesdropper. Residual interference is considered to reflect the effects of
imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the receive
signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratios, which results in a degraded system
performance. To maximize the average secrecy rate (ASR), the dual-UAV
trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are jointly optimized subject to the
transmit power budget, UAV maneuvering constraint, and sensing requirements. To
tackle the highly complicated non-convex ASR maximization problem, the dual-UAV
trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are optimized for the secure communication
(SC) purpose and the SCS purpose, sequentially. In the SC phase, a block
coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to optimize the dual-UAV trajectory
and dual-UAV beamforming iteratively, using the trust-region successive convex
approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Then, a
weighted distance minimization problem is formulated to determine the dual-UAV
maneuvering positions suitable for the SCS purpose, which is solved by a
heuristic greedy algorithm, followed by the joint optimization of source
beamforming and jamming beamforming.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于隐私保护的深度学习模型（Transformer）来预测用户多时段视频需求，并通过优化缓存策略以提高无线边缘视频流性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信中视频流占大部分流量，通过缓存热门视频可提升性能。但由于涉及多方（如用户、ISP、CSP）不愿共享历史数据，需要隐私保护的解决方案。

Method: 采用隐私保护的联邦学习训练Transformer预测用户多时段需求，考虑预测误差建模文件流行度，并设计贪婪算法优化长期系统收益。

Result: 仿真结果显示联邦学习方案接近集中式（非隐私保护）方案，且收益优化可能不同于传统CHR标准。

Conclusion: 隐私保护的预测和缓存优化方法能有效提升无线边缘视频流性能，同时保护用户数据隐私。

Abstract: Performance of video streaming, which accounts for most of the traffic in
wireless communication, can be significantly improved by caching popular videos
at the wireless edge. Determining the cache content that optimizes performance
(defined via a revenue function) is thus an important task, and prediction of
the future demands based on past history can make this process much more
efficient. However, since practical video caching networks involve various
parties (e.g., users, isp, and csp) that do not wish to reveal information such
as past history to each other, privacy-preserving solutions are required.
Motivated by this, we propose a proactive caching method based on users'
privacy-preserving multi-slot future demand predictions -- obtained from a
trained Transformer -- to optimize revenue. Specifically, we first use a
privacy-preserving fl algorithm to train a Transformer to predict multi-slot
future demands of the users. However, prediction accuracy is not perfect and
decreases the farther into the future the prediction is done. We model the
impact of prediction errors invoking the file popularities, based on which we
formulate a long-term system revenue optimization to make the cache placement
decisions. As the formulated problem is NP-hard, we use a greedy algorithm to
efficiently obtain an approximate solution. Simulation results validate that
(i) the fl solution achieves results close to the centralized
(non-privacy-preserving) solution and (ii) optimization of revenue may provide
different solutions than the classical chr criterion.

Conclusion: CGDM通过隐式先验学习和轻量化设计，有效连接了粗粒度和细粒度CF，为智能环境感知通信提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition for massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is essential for future mobile
communication networks. Channel fingerprint (CF), also referred to as channel
knowledge map, is a key enabler for intelligent environment-aware communication
and can facilitate CSI acquisition. However, due to the cost limitations of
practical sensing nodes and test vehicles, the resulting CF is typically
coarse-grained, making it insufficient for wireless transceiver design. In this
work, we introduce the concept of CF twins and design a conditional generative
diffusion model (CGDM) with strong implicit prior learning capabilities as the
computational core of the CF twin to establish the connection between coarse-
and fine-grained CFs. Specifically, we employ a variational inference technique
to derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for the log-marginal distribution of
the observed fine-grained CF conditioned on the coarse-grained CF, enabling the
CGDM to learn the complicated distribution of the target data. During the
denoising neural network optimization, the coarse-grained CF is introduced as
side information to accurately guide the conditioned generation of the CGDM. To
make the proposed CGDM lightweight, we further leverage the additivity of
network layers and introduce a one-shot pruning approach along with a
multi-objective knowledge distillation technique. Experimental results show
that the proposed approach exhibits significant improvement in reconstruction
performance compared to the baselines. Additionally, zero-shot testing on
reconstruction tasks with different magnification factors further demonstrates
the scalability and generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Result: 实验结果表明，CDiff在EnvCF构建上的表现显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CDiff能够有效重构细粒度EnvCF，为环境感知通信提供了重要支持。

Abstract: The paradigm shift from environment-unaware communication to intelligent
environment-aware communication is expected to facilitate the acquisition of
channel state information for future wireless communications. Channel
Fingerprint (CF), as an emerging enabling technology for environment-aware
communication, provides channel-related knowledge for potential locations
within the target communication area. However, due to the limited availability
of practical devices for sensing environmental information and measuring
channel-related knowledge, most of the acquired environmental information and
CF are coarse-grained, insufficient to guide the design of wireless
transmissions. To address this, this paper proposes a deep conditional
generative learning approach, namely a customized conditional generative
diffusion model (CDiff). The proposed CDiff simultaneously refines
environmental information and CF, reconstructing a fine-grained CF that
incorporates environmental information, referred to as EnvCF, from its
coarse-grained counterpart. Experimental results show that the proposed
approach significantly improves the performance of EnvCF construction compared
to the baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的Fr'echet距离度量方法为生成式AI在智能电网中的应用提供了更可靠的数据质量评估工具。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in smart grids have advanced
significantly in recent years due to their ability to generate large amounts of
synthetic data, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain in the real world
due to confidentiality constraints. A key challenge in utilizing such synthetic
data is how to assess the data quality produced from such generative models.
Traditional Euclidean distance-based metrics only reflect pair-wise relations
between two individual samples, and could fail in evaluating quality
differences between groups of synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a
novel metric based on the Fr\'{e}chet Distance (FD) estimated between two
datasets in a learned feature space. The proposed method evaluates the quality
of generation from a distributional perspective. Empirical results demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed metric across timescales and models, enhancing
the reliability of data-driven decision-making in smart grid operations.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum computing,
involving the reconstruction of an unknown quantum state from measurement
outcomes. Although essential, it is typically introduced at the graduate level
due to its reliance on advanced concepts such as the density matrix formalism,
tensor product structures, and partial trace operations. This complexity often
creates a barrier for students and early learners. In this work, we introduce
QubitLens, an interactive visualization tool designed to make quantum state
tomography more accessible and intuitive. QubitLens leverages maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE), a classical statistical method, to estimate pure
quantum states from projective measurement outcomes in the X, Y, and Z bases.
The tool emphasizes conceptual clarity through visual representations,
including Bloch sphere plots of true and reconstructed qubit states, bar charts
comparing parameter estimates, and fidelity gauges that quantify reconstruction
accuracy. QubitLens offers a hands-on approach to learning quantum tomography
without requiring deep prior knowledge of density matrices or optimization
theory. The tool supports both single- and multi-qubit systems and is intended
to bridge the gap between theory and practice in quantum computing education.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been a long-standing candidate for
processing of temporal sequence data, especially in memory-constrained systems
that one may find in embedded edge computing environments. Recent advances in
training paradigms have now inspired new generations of efficient RNNs. We
introduce a streamlined and hardware-compatible architecture based on minimal
gated recurrent units (GRUs), and an accompanying efficient mixed-signal
hardware implementation of the model. The proposed design leverages
switched-capacitor circuits not only for in-memory computation (IMC), but also
for the gated state updates. The mixed-signal cores rely solely on commodity
circuits consisting of metal capacitors, transmission gates, and a clocked
comparator, thus greatly facilitating scaling and transfer to other technology
nodes.
  We benchmark the performance of our architecture on time series data,
introducing all constraints required for a direct mapping to the hardware
system. The direct compatibility is verified in mixed-signal simulations,
reproducing data recorded from the software-only network model.

Motivation: 长距离通信中，偏振切换技术对于安全传输二进制数据至关重要。现有偏振开关通常尺寸远大于波长，在微波频段（波长>1 cm）尤为不便。因此，开发超亚波长偏振开关具有重要技术意义。

Method: 采用磁致伸缩纳米磁体（约100 nm横向尺寸）阵列沉积在压电基底上，形成人工磁性晶体。通过表面声波（SAW）激发纳米磁体中的自旋波（声子-磁子耦合），再通过磁子-光子耦合辐射电磁波，改变SAW传播方向即可实现偏振旋转。

Result: 实验证明，通过调控SAW传播方向，可在特定频率下将辐射光束的偏振方向旋转约90度，成功实现微波频段的超亚波长偏振切换。

Conclusion: 该研究首次展示了基于人工磁性晶体的微波偏振切换技术，解决了传统开关在微波频段的尺寸限制，为未来通信和加密系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability to switch the polarization of a transmitted electromagnetic wave
from vertical to horizontal, or vice versa, is of great technological interest
because of its many applications in long distance communication. Binary bits
can be encoded in two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted securely from
point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than
the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Consequently, most research in this
area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short
(~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not
too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the
wavelength is much larger (typically > 1 cm). That makes a microwave
ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, we report such
a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral
dimension) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an "artificial
magnonic crystal". A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with
suitable electrodes excites spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon
coupling, resulting in radiation of electromagnetic waves via magnon-photon
coupling. The polarization of the beam radiated in a given direction at a given
frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by changing the direction of SAW
propagation in the substrate to implement the polarization switch.
