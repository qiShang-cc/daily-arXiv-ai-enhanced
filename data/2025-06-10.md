Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living
with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without
continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable
early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life
for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark
machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in
community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A
new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was
introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine
learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem
formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular
sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly
detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the
Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly
available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,
comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most
effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the
current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.
Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation
history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720
and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work
presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques
for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using
privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and
efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in
place.

Abstract: Olive production is an important tree crop in Mediterranean climates.
However, olive yield varies significantly due to climate change. Accurately
estimating yield using remote sensing and machine learning remains a complex
challenge. In this study, we developed a streamlined pipeline for olive yield
estimation in the Kairouan and Sousse governorates of Tunisia. We extracted
features from multispectral reflectance bands, vegetation indices derived from
Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-9 OLI-2 satellite imagery, along with digital
elevation model data. These spatial features were combined with ground-based
field survey data to form a structured tabular dataset. We then developed an
automated ensemble learning framework, implemented using AutoGluon to train and
evaluate multiple machine learning models, select optimal combinations through
stacking, and generate robust yield predictions using five-fold
cross-validation. The results demonstrate strong predictive performance from
both sensors, with Landsat-8 OLI achieving R2 = 0.8635 and RMSE = 1.17 tons per
ha, and Landsat-9 OLI-2 achieving R2 = 0.8378 and RMSE = 1.32 tons per ha. This
study highlights a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate method for olive
yield estimation, with potential applicability across diverse agricultural
regions globally.

Abstract: In the field of automatic Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, due to the
relatively limited amount of labeled data, how to build a robust ECG pretrained
model based on unlabeled data is a key area of focus for researchers. Recent
advancements in contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained models highlight the
potential of exploiting the additional patient-level self-supervisory signals
inherent in ECG. They are referred to as patient contrastive learning. Its
rationale is that multiple physical recordings from the same patient may share
commonalities, termed patient consistency, so redefining positive and negative
pairs in contrastive learning as intrapatient and inter-patient samples
provides more shared context to learn an effective representation. However,
these methods still fail to efficiently exploit patient consistency due to the
insufficient amount of intra-inter patient samples existing in a batch. Hence,
we propose a contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained model enhanced by the
Patient Memory Queue (PMQ), which incorporates a large patient memory queue to
mitigate model degeneration that can arise from insufficient intra-inter
patient samples. In order to further enhance the performance of the pretrained
model, we introduce two extra data augmentation methods to provide more
perspectives of positive and negative pairs for pretraining. Extensive
experiments were conducted on three public datasets with three different data
ratios. The experimental results show that the comprehensive performance of our
method outperforms previous contrastive learning methods and exhibits greater
robustness in scenarios with limited labeled data. The code is available at
https://github.com/3hiuwoo/PMQ.

Conclusion: TDA增强学习方法为实时、可靠的地下物体检测提供了新途径，在城规、安全检查和基础设施管理中有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection
and maintenance. However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited
by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a
novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities,
especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived
from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial
detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a
novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features
in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the
geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated
real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and
realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated
and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and
efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of
TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object
detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and
infrastructure management.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督框架MoE-Gyro，解决MEMS陀螺仪测量范围与噪声性能的固有权衡问题，并通过ISEBench验证其显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对MEMS陀螺仪在测量范围和噪声抑制之间的固有权衡问题，现有硬件或深度学习方案存在复杂性、成本或部署难度，需新的解决方案。

Method: MoE-Gyro采用双专家结构（ORE和DE），分别处理信号重构和噪声抑制，并通过门控模块动态路由输入。

Result: 实验显示，MoE-Gyro将可测量范围扩展到1500 deg/s，降低偏置不稳定性98.4%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MoE-Gyro有效解决了惯性传感领域的长期权衡问题，并通过ISEBench提供了标准化评估平台。

Abstract: MEMS gyroscopes play a critical role in inertial navigation and motion
control applications but typically suffer from a fundamental trade-off between
measurement range and noise performance. Existing hardware-based solutions
aimed at mitigating this issue introduce additional complexity, cost, and
scalability challenges. Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise
reduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making
them difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental
trade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of
Experts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework
specifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and
noise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction
Expert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing
saturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch
complementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise
reduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the
appropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive
standard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this
gap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source
benchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified
evaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods. We evaluate MoE-Gyro using our
proposed ISEBench, demonstrating that our framework significantly extends the
measurable range from 450 deg/s to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by
98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the
long-standing trade-off in inertial sensing.

### [8] [On the Interplay of Privacy, Persuasion and Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06321)
*Anju Anand,Emrah Akyol*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通信理论框架，用于解决物理信息系统中编码器与解码器在目标不一致情况下的隐私保护和弹性决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决物理信息系统中编码器和解码器目标不一致时的隐私保护与决策优化问题。传统方法中两者共享均方误差（MSE）目标，但实际场景中隐私保护的需求引入了新的冲突。

Method: 通过提出一个拉格朗日框架，编码器在合法控制精度和隐私泄露之间权衡。对于有限率信道，采用基于梯度的优化方法计算最优控制器，并分析了完全、部分和非揭示策略。

Result: 研究发现，调节隐私参数可以实现控制性能和抗非法推断之间的折衷。对于无速率约束的情况，还刻画了最优线性编码器。

Conclusion: 该框架为物理信息系统中的隐私保护和弹性决策提供了理论支持，并通过数值实验验证了不同隐私参数下的性能权衡。

Abstract: We develop a communication-theoretic framework for privacy-aware and
resilient decision making in cyber-physical systems under misaligned objectives
between the encoder and the decoder. The encoder observes two correlated
signals ($X$,$\theta$) and transmits a finite-rate message $Z$ to aid a
legitimate controller (the decoder) in estimating $X+\theta$, while an
eavesdropper intercepts $Z$ to infer the private parameter $\theta$. Unlike
conventional setups where encoder and decoder share a common MSE objective,
here the encoder minimizes a Lagrangian that balances legitimate control
fidelity and the privacy leakage about $\theta$. In contrast, the decoder's
goal is purely to minimize its own estimation error without regard for privacy.
We analyze fully, partially, and non-revealing strategies that arise from this
conflict, and characterize optimal linear encoders when the rate constraints
are lifted. For finite-rate channels, we employ gradient-based methods to
compute the optimal controllers. Numerical experiments illustrate how tuning
the privacy parameter shapes the trade-off between control performance and
resilience against unauthorized inferences.

### [9] [Composite Reward Design in PPO-Driven Adaptive Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06323)
*Abdullah Burkan Bereketoglu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于PPO的自适应滤波框架，用于动态非平稳环境中的去噪，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统滤波方法（如LMS、RLS等）在非平稳环境中因假设固定或需要复杂调参而受限，需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 使用PPO算法，结合复合奖励（SNR改善、MSE降低和残差平滑）进行自适应滤波。

Result: 在合成信号上测试，PPO代理能泛化训练分布之外，实时性能优于经典滤波器。

Conclusion: 证明了策略梯度强化学习在鲁棒、低延迟自适应信号滤波中的可行性。

Abstract: Model-free and reinforcement learning-based adaptive filtering methods are
gaining traction for denoising in dynamic, non-stationary environments such as
wireless signal channels. Traditional filters like LMS, RLS, Wiener, and Kalman
are limited by assumptions of stationary or requiring complex fine-tuning or
exact noise statistics or fixed models. This letter proposes an adaptive
filtering framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a
composite reward that balances SNR improvement, MSE reduction, and residual
smoothness. Experiments on synthetic signals with various noise types show that
our PPO agent generalizes beyond its training distribution, achieving real-time
performance and outperforming classical filters. This work demonstrates the
viability of policy-gradient reinforcement learning for robust, low-latency
adaptive signal filtering.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上验证，方法不仅性能优于现有技术，且对噪声和伪影具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多视角融合结合不确定性感知能有效提升ECG心律失常分类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a deep neural architecture that performs uncertainty-aware
multi-view classification of arrhythmia from ECG. Our method learns two
different views (1D and 2D) of single-lead ECG to capture different types of
information. We use a fusion technique to reduce the conflict between the
different views caused by noise and artifacts in ECG data, thus incorporating
uncertainty to obtain stronger final predictions. Our framework contains the
following three modules (1) a time-series module to learn the morphological
features from ECG; (2) an image-space learning module to learn the
spatiotemporal features; and (3) the uncertainty-aware fusion module to fuse
the information from the two different views. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework not only improves the
performance on arrhythmia classification compared to the state-of-the-art but
also shows better robustness to noise and artifacts present in ECG.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements
that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance
beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties.
They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via
optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it
is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must
ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate

In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of
previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient

mechanism is incorporated to simplify complex matrix multiplications and
improve computational efficiency. Experimental results based on collected sound
signals during the operation of railway point machines demonstrate that the
optimized model reduces parameter count and computational complexity by 50%
while improving diagnostic accuracy by nearly 3%, ultimately achieving an

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于越来越多的遥感平台用于甲烷羽流检测，需要解决跨平台数据对齐的问题，以提高检测准确性。

Method: 结合迁移学习和CycleGAN，利用机载AVIRIS-NG数据优化星载EMIT数据的甲烷羽流分类器。

Result: 通过CycleGAN将星载数据转换到机载域，并直接应用机载分类器，取得了最佳的羽流检测效果。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于甲烷羽流检测，还能广泛应用于不同遥感仪器的数据对齐任务。

Abstract: Prioritizing methane for near-term climate action is crucial due to its
significant impact on global warming. Previous work used columnwise matched
filter products from the airborne AVIRIS-NG imaging spectrometer to detect
methane plume sources; convolutional neural networks (CNNs) discerned
anthropogenic methane plumes from false positive enhancements. However, as an
increasing number of remote sensing platforms are used for methane plume
detection, there is a growing need to address cross-platform alignment. In this
work, we describe model- and data-driven machine learning approaches that
leverage airborne observations to improve spaceborne methane plume detection,
reconciling the distributional shifts inherent with performing the same task
across platforms. We develop a spaceborne methane plume classifier using data
from the EMIT imaging spectroscopy mission. We refine classifiers trained on
airborne imagery from AVIRIS-NG campaigns using transfer learning,
outperforming the standalone spaceborne model. Finally, we use CycleGAN, an
unsupervised image-to-image translation technique, to align the data
distributions between airborne and spaceborne contexts. Translating spaceborne
EMIT data to the airborne AVIRIS-NG domain using CycleGAN and applying airborne
classifiers directly yields the best plume detection results. This methodology
is useful not only for data simulation, but also for direct data alignment.
Though demonstrated on the task of methane plume detection, our work more
broadly demonstrates a data-driven approach to align related products obtained
from distinct remote sensing instruments.

TL;DR: 研究比较了传统机器学习和深度学习方法对ECG信号心跳分类的效果，结果表明基于手工特征的LightGBM优于图像化后的CNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何有效分类ECG信号中的心跳，比较手工特征与图像化方法的优劣。

Method: 使用HRV等手工特征训练多种分类器，以及通过GAF、MTF和RP将ECG信号转为图像后使用CNN分类。

Result: LightGBM表现最佳（准确率99%，F1 0.94），优于CNN（F1 0.85），SVM和AdaBoost表现较差。

Conclusion: 手工特征能更好捕捉ECG信号的时域和形态变化，未来可结合多导联信号与时序依赖提升分类效果。

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals
through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing
hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats.
The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering,
and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis.
In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean,
variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers,
including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and
LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images
using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and
Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN
architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest
performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the
image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost
yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this
task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to
capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to
image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may
benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies
across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究通过优化卷积神经网络，提高了对全球范围内温度和风场模拟的次声传输损失（TLs）的预测精度，平均误差为8.6 dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高次声传输损失的建模效率，解决现有方法在高频率和大距离下的预测问题。

Method: 采用优化的卷积神经网络，基于全球范围内的温度和风场模拟数据，预测次声传输损失。

Result: 优化后的模型在整个频段（0.1-3.2 Hz）中平均误差为8.6 dB，适用于真实大气场景。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了次声传输损失的预测性能，为全球监测系统的运行提供了支持。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission losses (TLs) is essential to
assess the performance of the global International Monitoring System infrasound
network. Among existing propagation modeling tools, parabolic equation (PE)
method enables TLs to be finely modeled, but its computational cost does not
allow exploration of a large parameter space for operational monitoring
applications. To reduce computation times, Brissaud et al. 2023 explored the
potential of convolutional neural networks trained on a large set of regionally
simulated wavefields (< 1000 km from the source) to predict TLs with negligible
computation times compared to PE simulations. However, this method struggles in
unfavorable initial wind conditions, especially at high frequencies, and causal
issues with winds at large distances from the source affecting ground TLs close
to the source. In this study, we have developed an optimized convolutional
network designed to minimize prediction errors while predicting TLs from
globally simulated combined temperature and wind fields spanning over
propagation ranges of 4000 km. Our approach enhances the previously proposed
one by implementing key optimizations that improve the overall architecture
performance. The implemented model predicts TLs with an average error of 8.6 dB

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission loss is essential for evaluating
the performance of the International Monitoring System, enabling the effective
design and maintenance of infrasound stations to support compliance of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. State-of-the-art propagation modeling
tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models.
However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter
space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies
made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss
predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric
models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of
temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long range
propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and
temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km
altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the neural
network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture
spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric
models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an
average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and
provides epistemic and data-related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on
the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its
prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included
in the training. This represents a significant step towards near real-time
assessment of International Monitoring System detection thresholds of explosive
sources.

Abstract: Accurately detecting drowsiness is vital to driving safety. Among all
measures, physiological-signal-based drowsiness monitoring can be more
privacy-preserving than a camera-based approach. However, conflicts exist
regarding how physiological metrics are associated with different drowsiness
labels across datasets. Thus, we analyzed key features from electrocardiograms
(ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiratory (RESP) signals across four
datasets, where different drowsiness inducers (such as fatigue and low arousal)
and assessment methods (subjective vs. objective) were used. Binary logistic
regression models were built to identify the physiological metrics that are
associated with drowsiness. Findings indicate that distinct different
drowsiness inducers can lead to different physiological responses, and
objective assessments were more sensitive than subjective ones in detecting
drowsiness. Further, the increased heart rate stability, reduced respiratory
amplitude, and decreased tonic EDA are robustly associated with increased
drowsiness. The results enhance understanding of drowsiness detection and can
inform future generalizable monitoring designs.

essential for extracting meaningful emotional and physiological biomarkers.
This study presents a comparative analysis of knowledge-driven, statistical,

fidelity (SCR frequency, amplitude, and tonic slope) and robustness to noisy,
real-world data. The model demonstrates potential for real-time biosignal
analysis and future applications in stress prediction, digital mental health
interventions, and physiological forecasting.

Conclusion: DNN显著提升了IM观测的信噪比，具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: 21-cm Intensity Mapping (IM) is a promising approach to detecting information
about the large-scale structure beyond the local universe. One of the biggest
challenges for an IM observation is the foreground removal procedure. In this
paper, we attempt to conduct the restoration of contaminated data in an IM
experiment with a Deep Neural Network (DNN). To investigate the impact of such
data restoration, we compare the root-mean-square (RMS) of data with and
without restoration after foreground removal using polynomial fitting, singular
value decomposition, and independent component analysis, respectively. We find
that the DNN-based pipeline performs well in lowering the RMS level of data,
especially for data with large contaminated fractions. Furthermore, we
investigate the impact of the restoration on the large-scale 21-cm signal in
the simulation generated by CRIME. Simulation results show that the angular
power spectrum curves from data with restoration are closer to the real one.
Our work demonstrates that the DNN-based data restoration approach
significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio compared with conventional
ones, achieving excellent potential for IM observations.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has
significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of
radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques
struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by
non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization
accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the
development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing
localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods
often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and
inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based
localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and
improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to
learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural
channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison
dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method
outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization
accuracy, even in NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by
several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously
reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical
fingerprinting methods.

Abstract: To manage and optimize constantly evolving wireless networks, existing

increased computational costs during training and a lack of transparency in

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in the integration of reconfigurable intelligent

meaningful performance gains across realistic deployment scenarios. This paper
addresses this challenge by presenting a practical and scenario-aware

Our findings show that RIS deployment effectiveness is highly sensitive to both

validated through comprehensive simulations, offers design guidelines for

Conclusion: 研究成功实现了高精度SFOL脉冲在现有高功率DME系统中的经济高效集成，提升了飞机定位精度并符合行业标准。

Abstract: The Stretched-FrOnt-Leg (SFOL) pulse is an advanced distance measuring
equipment (DME) pulse that offers superior ranging accuracy compared to
conventional Gaussian pulses. Successful SFOL pulse transmission has been
recently demonstrated from a commercial Gaussian pulse-based DME in low-power
mode utilizing digital predistortion (DPD) techniques for power amplifiers.
These adjustments were achieved through software modifications, enabling SFOL
integration without replacing existing DME infrastructure. However, the SFOL
pulse is designed to optimize ranging capabilities by leveraging the effective
radiated power (ERP) and pulse shape parameters permitted within DME
specifications. Consequently, it operates with narrow margins against these
specifications, potentially leading to non-compliance when transmitted in
high-power mode. This paper introduces strategies to enable a Gaussian
pulse-based DME to transmit the SFOL pulse while adhering to DME specifications
in high-power mode. The proposed strategies involve use of a variant of the
SFOL pulse and DPD techniques utilizing truncated singular value decomposition,
tailored for high-power DME operations. Test results, conducted on a testbed
utilizing a commercial Gaussian pulse-based DME, demonstrate the effectiveness
of these strategies, ensuring compliance with DME specifications in high-power
mode with minimal performance loss. This study enables cost-effective
integration of high-accuracy SFOL pulses into existing high-power DME systems,
enhancing aircraft positioning precision while ensuring compliance with
industry standards.

Conclusion: IQFM展示了原始IQ基础模型在6G系统中的高效性和可重用性，为多任务学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Foundational models have shown remarkable potential in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet remain in their infancy in wireless
communications. While a few efforts have explored image-based modalities such
as channel state information (CSI) and frequency spectrograms, foundational
models that operate directly on raw IQ data remain largely unexplored. This
paper presents, IQFM, the first I/Q signal foundational model for wireless
communications. IQFM supporting diverse tasks: modulation classification,
angle-of-arrival (AoA), beam prediction, and RF fingerprinting, without heavy
preprocessing or handcrafted features. We also introduce a task-aware
augmentation strategy that categorizes transformations into core augmentations,
such as cyclic time shifting, and task-specific augmentations. This strategy
forms the basis for structured, task-dependent representation learning within a
contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Using this strategy, the
lightweight encoder, pre-trained via SSL on over-the-air multi-antenna IQ data,
achieves up to 99.67% and 65.45% accuracy on modulation and AoA classification,
respectively, using only one labeled sample per class, outperforming supervised
baselines by up to 7x and 145x. The model also generalizes to
out-of-distribution tasks; when adapted to new tasks using only 500 samples per
class and minimal parameter updates via LoRA, the same frozen encoder achieves
94.15% on beam prediction (vs. 89.53% supervised), 50.00% on RML2016a
modulation classification (vs. 49.30%), and 96.05% on RF fingerprinting (vs.
96.64%). These results demonstrate the potential of raw IQ-based foundational
models as efficient, reusable encoders for multi-task learning in AI-native 6G

Conclusion: SFI-LoRa是LPWAN领域中高数据速率应用的潜在解决方案。

Abstract: LoRa is a widely recognized modulation technology in the field of low power
wide area networks (LPWANs). However, the data rate of LoRa is too low to
satisfy the requirements in the context of modern Internet of Things (IoT)
applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel high-data-rate LoRa
scheme based on the spreading factor index (SFI). In the proposed SFI-LoRa
scheme, the starting frequency bin (SFB) of chirp signals is used to transmit
information bits, while the combinations of spreading factors (SFs) are
exploited as a set of indices to convey additional information bits. Moreover,
theoretical expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) and throughput of the
proposed SFI-LoRa scheme are derived over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
and Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation results not only verify the accuracy
of the theoretical analysis, but also demonstrate that the proposed SFI-LoRa
scheme improves both the bit error rate (BER) and throughput performance
compared to existing high-data-rate LoRa schemes. Therefore, the proposed
SFI-LoRa scheme is a potential solution for applications requiring a high data
rate in the LPWAN domain.

Abstract: Existing works on Cell-Free Massive MIMO primarily focus on optimising system

limited focus on variable user demand as required by higher network layers.
Additionally, existing works only minimise the transmitted power instead of the
consumed power at the power amplifier. This work introduces a
penalty-method-based approach to minimise the amplifier's power consumption
while scaling much better with network size than current solutions and
promoting sparsity in the power allocated to each access point. Furthermore, we
demonstrate substantial reductions in power consumption (up to 24%) by

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN)
principles with non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and investigates the
optimization of the functional split between Centralized Units (CU) and
Distributed Units (DU) to improve energy efficiency in dynamic network

that the proposed policy effectively adapts to network traffic flow by
selecting an efficient network disaggregation strategy and corresponding
functional split option based on data rate and latency requirements.

Abstract: The rapid growth of data traffic and the emerging AI-native wireless
architectures in NextG cellular systems place new demands on the fronthaul
links of Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RAN). In this paper, we investigate
neural compression techniques for the Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI),
aiming to reduce the fronthaul bandwidth while preserving signal quality. We
introduce two deep learning-based compression algorithms designed to optimize
the transformation of wireless signals into bit sequences for CPRI
transmission. The first algorithm utilizes a non-linear transformation coupled
with scalar/vector quantization based on a learned codebook. The second
algorithm generates a latent vector transformed into a variable-length output
bit sequence via arithmetic encoding, guided by the predicted probability
distribution of each latent element. Novel techniques such as a shared weight
model for storage-limited devices and a successive refinement model for
managing multiple CPRI links with varying Quality of Service (QoS) are
proposed. Extensive simulation results demonstrate notable Error Vector
Magnitude (EVM) gains with improved rate-distortion performance for both
algorithms compared to traditional methods. The proposed solutions are robust
to variations in channel conditions, modulation formats, and noise levels,
highlighting their potential for enabling efficient and scalable fronthaul in
NextG AI-native networks as well as aligning with the current 3GPP research
directions.

Conclusion: 所提模型在导频污染和低SNR条件下表现出更高的鲁棒性，特别适用于感知目标附近用户。

Abstract: Cell-free Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) aims to revolutionize
6th Generation (6G) networks. By combining distributed access points with ISAC
capabilities, it boosts spectral efficiency, situational awareness, and
communication reliability. Channel estimation is a critical step in cell-free
ISAC systems to ensure reliable communication, but its performance is usually
limited by challenges such as pilot contamination and noisy channel estimates.
This paper presents a novel framework leveraging sensing information as a key
input within a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model (CDDM). In this framework,
we integrate CDDM with a Multimodal Transformer (MMT) to enhance channel
estimation in ISAC-enabled cell-free systems. The MMT encoder effectively
captures inter-modal relationships between sensing and location data, enabling
the CDDM to iteratively denoise and refine channel estimates. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains. As compared with Least Squares (LS) and Minimum Mean Squared Error
(MMSE) estimators, the proposed model achieves normalized mean squared error
(NMSE) improvements of 8 dB and 9 dB, respectively. Moreover, we achieve a
27.8% NMSE improvement compared to the traditional denoising diffusion model
(TDDM), which does not incorporate sensing channel information. Additionally,
the model exhibits higher robustness against pilot contamination and maintains
high accuracy under challenging conditions, such as low signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs). According to the simulation results, the model performs well for users
near sensing targets by leveraging the correlation between sensing and
communication channels.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the near-field regime offers
the potential to jointly support high-rate downlink transmission and
high-resolution multi-target detection by exploiting the spherical-wave nature
of electromagnetic propagation. In this paper, we propose a unified beamforming
framework for a multi-user multi-target near-field ISAC system. In this system,
a multi-antenna base station simultaneously serves multiple single-antenna
users and senses multiple point-targets without prior knowledge of their radar
cross sections. By optimizing the transmit covariance matrix, our design
maximizes the minimum weighted transmit beampattern gain across all targets to
ensure accurate sensing while strictly limiting inter-target cross-correlations
and guaranteeing per-user communication rate and total power constraints. We
extend classical far-field beampattern and cross-correlation measures to the
near-field by incorporating both angle and range dependencies, enabling
discrimination of targets along the same direction but at different distances.
The resulting non-convex program is efficiently relaxed to a semidefinite
program via rank-one lifting. We then develop a closed-form reconstruction to
recover optimal rank-one beamformers. Numerical simulations demonstrate that
our near-field ISAC design can simultaneously resolve and serve users/targets
along the same direction but at different distances, achieving significant
gains over far-field and single-target benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been explored as a supportive
technology for wireless communication since around 2019. While the literature
highlights the potential of RIS in different modern applications, two key
issues have gained significant attention from the research community: channel
estimation and phase shift optimization. The performance gains of RIS-assisted
systems rely heavily on optimal phase shifts, which, in turn, depend on
accurate channel estimation. Several studies have addressed these challenges
under different assumptions. Some works consider a range of continuous phase
shifts, while others propose a limited number of discrete phase values for the
RIS elements. Many studies present an idealized perspective, whereas others aim
to approximate more practical aspects by considering circuit system responses
and employing phase shifts derived from a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) or
other lookup tables. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the
influence of circuit system parameters on channel estimation and subsequent
phase shift optimization. This paper models each RIS element as an equivalent
resonant circuit composed of resistance, capacitance, and inductance. We
propose that resistance and capacitance parameters can be dynamically and
independently configured, leading to the formulation of an impedance matrix.
Furthermore, we construct a circuit-based RIS phase shift matrix that accounts
for the response of the resonant circuit, which changes with variations in the
physical parameters of resistance and capacitance. We investigate the impact of
this circuit-based RIS phase shift within a tensor-based channel estimation
approach. Our results indicate a performance loss compared to ideal scenarios,
such as those using the DFT design. However, we found that increasing the
training time can mitigate this performance degradation.

Abstract: Communication systems aided by movable antennas have been the subject of
recent research due to their potentially increased spatial degrees of freedom
offered by optimizing the antenna positioning at the transmitter and/or
receiver. In this context, a topic that deserves attention is channel
estimation. Conventional methods reported recently rely on pilot-assisted
strategies to estimate the channel coefficients. In this work, we address the
joint channel and symbol estimation problem for an uplink multi-user
communication system, where the base station is equipped with a movable antenna
array. A semi-blind receiver based on the PARAFAC2 model is formulated to
exploit the tensor decomposition structure for the received signals, from which
channel and symbol estimates can be jointly obtained via an alternating
estimation algorithm. Compared with reference schemes, our preliminary
numerical simulations yield remarkable results for the proposed method.

Motivation: 解决现有Huffman BMOCZ方法需要循环置换码（CPC）进行导频自由CFO校正的问题，简化CFO估计流程。

Method: 通过引入不对称性到Huffman BMOCZ的零点星座，利用其相同的非周期性自相关函数推导频域度量以估计CFO。

Result: 数值模拟表明，J-BMOCZ在CFO下的误码率（BER）损失仅为1 dB，且编码后的J-BMOCZ性能优于带CPC的Huffman BMOCZ。

Conclusion: J-BMOCZ是一种高效的非相干通信方法，简化了CFO估计并提升了性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose jutted binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal
zeros (J-BMOCZ) for non-coherent communication under a carrier frequency offset
(CFO). By introducing asymmetry to the Huffman BMOCZ zero constellation, we
exploit the identical aperiodic auto-correlation function of BMOCZ to derive a
Fourier-domain metric for CFO estimation. Unlike the existing methods for
Huffman BMOCZ, which require a cyclically permutable code (CPC) for pilot-free
CFO correction, J-BMOCZ enables the estimation of a CFO without the use of
pilots or channel coding. Through numerical simulations in additive white
Gaussian noise and fading channels, we show that the bit error rate (BER) loss
of J-BMOCZ under a CFO is just 1 dB over Huffman BMOCZ without a CFO.
Furthermore, the results show that coded J-BMOCZ achieves better BER
performance than Huffman BMOCZ with a CPC.

Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) improves the
traditional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architecture functionality
by interconnecting elements for advanced wave control. However, real-world
implementations face hardware imperfections, such as impedance mismatches and
varactor nonidealities, which can degrade overall system performance. In this
paper, we propose three hardware impairment models that directly affect the
BD-RIS scattering matrix structure and evaluate their impact on the channel
estimation accuracy using the normalized mean square error (NMSE) as a
performance metric. The proposed impairment models consider imperfections
affecting self-impedances, mutual impedances, or both. Our results reveal how
each impairment type degrades the system performance, allowing us to identify
scenarios where the traditional RIS can outperform the BD-RIS.

Abstract: This work presents a fully-digital high-accuracy real-time calibration
procedure for frequency and time alignment of open-loop wirelessly coordinated
coherent distributed antenna array (CDA) modems, enabling RF phase coherence of
spatially separated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software-defined radios
(SDRs) without any cables or external references such as global navigation
satellite system (GNSS). Building on previous work using high-accuracy
spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multi-step ToA
refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based
time-frequency coordination approach is demonstrated. By using a high-accuracy
time estimation approach, frequency estimates can be derived over long
observation intervals leading to a high-accuracy frequency estimate, without
the requirement for long pulse durations as is required for direct spectral
frequency estimation techniques, minimizing coordination overhead. Furthermore,
due to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and
frequency estimates are Doppler and multi-path tolerant, so long as the channel
is reciprocal over the synchronization epoch.
  This technique is experimentally verified by demonstrating wireless
distributed array coordination using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static
and dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time,
frequency, and phase stability were measured over coaxial cables to an
oscilloscope and achieved time and phase coordination precision of ~60-70 ps,
with median coherent gains above 99% using optimized parameters, and a
beamforming frequency RMSE of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario. Finally,
experiments are conducted to compare the performance of this technique with
previous work works using an analog continuous-wave two-tone (CWTT) frequency
reference technique in both static and dynamic settings as a benchmark.

Abstract: An Oculomotor Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) records neural activity from
regions of the brain involved in planning eye movements and translates this
activity into control commands. While previous successful oculomotor BCI
studies primarily relied on invasive microelectrode implants in non-human
primates, this study investigates the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a
minimally invasive endovascular Stentrode device implanted near the
supplementary motor area in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
To achieve this, self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks were
designed, in which the participant performed saccades in four directions (left,
right, up, down), with simultaneous recording of endovascular EEG and eye gaze.
The visually guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas the
free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. The results
showed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped
with the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct
saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked
approximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms. In
the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency
synchronisation below 15 Hz. Classification of 'fixation vs. saccade' was
robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 between sessions. In contrast,
classifying saccade direction proved more challenging, yielding within-session
AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the
best-performing binary comparisons (left vs. up and left vs. down). This
proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular
oculomotor BCI in an ALS patient, establishing a foundation for future
oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained traction in academia
and industry. Recently, multipath components (MPCs), as a type of spatial
resource, have the potential to improve the sensing performance in ISAC
systems, especially in richly scattering environments. In this paper, we
propose to leverage MPC and Khatri-Rao space-time (KRST) code within a single
ISAC system to realize high-accuracy sensing for multiple dynamic targets and
multi-user communication. Specifically, we propose a novel MPC-enhanced sensing
processing scheme with symbol-level fusion, referred to as the "SL-MPS" scheme,
to achieve high-accuracy localization of multiple dynamic targets and empower
the single ISAC system with a new capability of absolute velocity estimation
for multiple targets with a single sensing attempt. Furthermore, the KRST code
is applied to flexibly balance communication and sensing performance in richly
scattering environments. To evaluate the contribution of MPCs, the closed-form
Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) of location and absolute velocity estimation
are derived. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed SL-MPS scheme is
more robust and accurate in localization and absolute velocity estimation
compared with the existing state-of-the-art schemes.

Abstract: With the rapid development of radar jamming systems, especially digital radio
frequency memory (DRFM), the electromagnetic environment has become
increasingly complex. In recent years, most existing studies have focused
solely on either jamming recognition or anti-jamming strategy design. In this
paper, we propose a unified framework that integrates interference recognition
with intelligent anti-jamming strategy selection. Specifically, time-frequency
(TF) features of radar echoes are first extracted using both Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT) and Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD). A
feature fusion method is then designed to effectively combine these two types
of time-frequency representations. The fused TF features are further combined
with time-domain features of the radar echoes through a cross-modal fusion
module based on an attention mechanism. Finally, the recognition results,
together with information obtained from the passive radar, are fed into a Deep
Q-Network (DQN)-based intelligent anti-jamming strategy network to select
jamming suppression waveforms. The key jamming parameters obtained by the
passive radar provide essential information for intelligent decision-making,
enabling the generation of more effective strategies tailored to specific
jamming types. The proposed method demonstrates improvements in both jamming
type recognition accuracy and the stability of anti-jamming strategy selection
under complex environments. Experimental results show that our method achieves
superior performance compared to Support Vector Machines (SVM), VGG-16, and
2D-CNN methods, with respective improvements of 1.41%, 2.5%, and 14.51% in
overall accuracy. Moreover, in comparison with the SARSA algorithm, the
designed algorithm achieves faster reward convergence and more stable strategy
generation.

Conclusion: 提出的H-MVMM方案通过垂直联邦学习和在线更新策略，有效提升预编码性能并显著降低延迟。

Abstract: This paper investigates a heterogeneous multi-vehicle, multi-modal sensing
(H-MVMM) aided online precoding problem. The proposed H-MVMM scheme utilizes a
vertical federated learning (VFL) framework to minimize pilot sequence length
and optimize the sum rate. This offers a promising solution for reducing
latency in frequency division duplexing systems. To achieve this, three
preprocessing modules are designed to transform raw sensory data into
informative representations relevant to precoding. The approach effectively
addresses local data heterogeneity arising from diverse on-board sensor
configurations through a well-structured VFL training procedure. Additionally,
a label-free online model updating strategy is introduced, enabling the H-MVMM
scheme to adapt its weights flexibly. This strategy features a pseudo downlink
channel state information label simulator (PCSI-Simulator), which is trained
using a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach alongside an online loss
function. Numerical results show that the proposed method can closely
approximate the performance of traditional optimization techniques with perfect
channel state information, achieving a significant 90.6\% reduction in pilot
sequence length.

Conclusion: 夹持天线技术的引入为无线供电移动边缘计算系统提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper,we investigate a novel wireless powered mobile edge computing
(MEC) system assisted by pinching antennas (PAs), where devices first harvest
energy from a base station and then offload computation-intensive tasks to an
MEC server. As an emerging technology, PAs utilize long dielectric waveguides
embedded with multiple localized dielectric particles, which can be spatially
configured through a pinching mechanism to effectively reduce large-scale
propagation loss. This capability facilitates both efficient downlink energy
transfer and uplink task offloading. To fully exploit these advantages, we
adopt a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework and formulate a joint
optimization problem to maximize the system's computational capacity by jointly
optimizing device transmit power, time allocation, PA positions in both uplink
and downlink, and radiation control. To address the resulting non-convexity
caused by variable coupling, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm
that integrates particle swarm optimization (PSO) with successive convex
approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted
design substantially improves both energy harvesting efficiency and
computational performance compared to conventional antenna systems.

Conclusion: 基于MA的设计框架显著增强了雷达性能，并在实际环境中展现了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing
the performance of dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) systems. In this
paper, we explore an MA-aided DFRC system that utilizes a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance signal coverage for communications in dead
zones. To enhance the radar sensing performance in practical DFRC environments,
we propose a unified robust transceiver design framework aimed at maximizing
the minimum radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in a cluttered
environment. Our approach jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, receive
filtering, antenna placement, and RIS reflecting coefficients under imperfect
channel state information (CSI) for both sensing and communication channels. To
deal with the channel uncertainty-constrained issue, we leverage the convex
hull method to transform the primal problem into a more tractable form. We then
introduce a two-layer block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, incorporating
fractional programming (FP), successive convex approximation (SCA), S-Lemma,
and penalty techniques to reformulate it into a series of semidefinite program
(SDP) subproblems that can be efficiently solved. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the convergence and computational complexity for the proposed
design framework. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed
method, and show that the MA-based design framework can significantly enhance
the radar SINR performance while achieving an effective balance between the
radar and communication performance.

Abstract: To support future intelligent multifunctional sixth-generation (6G) wireless
communication networks, Synesthesia of Machines (SoM) is proposed as a novel
paradigm for artificial intelligence (AI)-native intelligent multi-modal
sensing-communication integration. However, existing SoM system designs rely on
task-specific AI models and face challenges such as scarcity of massive
high-quality datasets, constrained modeling capability, poor generalization,
and limited universality. Recently, foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a
new deep learning paradigm and have been preliminarily applied to SoM-related
tasks, but a systematic design framework is still lacking. In this paper, we
for the first time present a systematic categorization of FMs for SoM system
design, dividing them into general-purpose FMs, specifically large language
models (LLMs), and SoM domain-specific FMs, referred to as wireless foundation
models. Furthermore, we derive key characteristics of FMs in addressing
existing challenges in SoM systems and propose two corresponding roadmaps,
i.e., LLM-based and wireless foundation model-based design. For each roadmap,
we provide a framework containing key design steps as a guiding pipeline and
several representative case studies of FM-empowered SoM system design.
Specifically, we propose LLM-based path loss generation (LLM4PG) and scatterer
generation (LLM4SG) schemes, and wireless channel foundation model (WiCo) for
SoM mechanism exploration, LLM-based wireless multi-task SoM transceiver
(LLM4WM) and wireless foundation model (WiFo) for SoM-enhanced transceiver
design, and wireless cooperative perception foundation model (WiPo) for
SoM-enhanced cooperative perception, demonstrating the significant superiority
of FMs over task-specific models. Finally, we summarize and highlight potential
directions for future research.

Motivation: 未来6G网络希望模糊通信与感知的界限，通过OFDM波形同时实现高吞吐量数据和环境感知。

Method: 研究通过三链路Rician信道模型，比较了四种检测器（Full LRT、PCA LRT、PCA+SVM线性与RBF核），将N维CSI投影到P≪N的主成分子空间。

Result: PCA方法比Full LRT快一个数量级且误码率接近最优，SVM在高维下表现稳健，AUC在低信噪比下仍保持较高水平。

Conclusion: PCA与轻量级SVM结合能实现快速、准确且鲁棒的散射体感知，为6G的ISAC应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Future 6G networks envisions to blur the line between communication and
sensing, leveraging ubiquitous OFDM waveforms for both high throughput data and
environmental awareness. In this work, we do a thorough analysis of
Communication based Sensing (CommSense) framework that embeds lightweight, PCA
based detectors into standard OFDM receivers; enabling real-time, device free
detection of passive scatterers (e.g.\ drones, vehicles etc.) without any extra
transmitters. Starting from a realistic three link Rician channel model (direct
Tx\(\rightarrow\)Rx, cascaded Tx\(\rightarrow\)Scatterer and
Scatterer\(\rightarrow\)Rx), we compare four detectors: the full dimensional
Likelihood Ratio Test (Full LRT), PCA based LRT, PCA+SVM with linear and RBF
kernels. By projecting \(N\)-dimensional CSI onto a \(P\ll N\) principal
component subspace, inference time gets reduced by an order of magnitude
compared to the full LRT, while achieving optimal error rates i.e. empirical
errors align tightly with the Bhattacharyya error bound and Area Under ROC
Curve (AUC)\(\approx1\) for \(P\approx10\). PCA+SVM classifiers further improve
robustness in very high dimensions (\(N=1024\)), maintaining AUC\(\gtrsim0.60\)
at \(-10\)dB and exceeding 0.90 by 0dB even when full LRT fails due to
numerical overflow. From the simulated result we have shown LRT based
techniques are susceptible to the parameter estimation error, where as SVM is
resilient to that. Our results demonstrate that PCA driven detection when
paired with lightweight SVMs can deliver fast, accurate, and robust scatterer
sensing, paving the way for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G
and beyond.

Abstract: This letter proposes a channel estimation method for reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems through a novel diffusion model (DM)
framework. We reformulate the channel estimation problem as a denoising
process, which aligns with the reverse process of the DM. To overcome the
inherent randomness in the reverse process of conventional DM approaches, we
adopt a deterministic sampling strategy with a step alignment mechanism that
ensures the accuracy of channel estimation while adapting to different
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, to reduce the number of parameters of
the U-Net, we meticulously design a lightweight network that achieves
comparable performance, thereby enhancing the practicality of our proposed
method. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance over a wide
range of SNRs compared to baselines. For instance, the proposed method achieves
performance improvements of up to 13.5 dB in normalized mean square error
(NMSE) at SNR = 0 dB. Notably, the proposed lightweight network exhibits almost
no performance loss compared to the original U-Net, while requiring only 6.59\%
of its parameters.

Conclusion: 多天线设备（如WiFi6/WiFi7）在DFL中有广泛应用潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Device-Free Localization (DFL) is a passive radio method able to detect,
estimate, and localize targets (e.g., human or other obstacles) that do not
need to carry any electronic device. According to the Integrated Sensing And
Communication (ISAC) paradigm, DFL networks exploit Radio Frequency (RF)
devices, used for communication purposes, to evaluate also the excess
attenuation due to targets moving in the monitored area, to estimate the target
positions and movements. Several target models have been discussed in the
literature to evaluate the target positions by exploiting the RF signals
received by networked devices. Among these models, Electromagnetic (EM) body
models emerged as an interesting research field for excess attenuation
prediction using commercial RF devices. While these RF devices are usually
single-antenna boards, the availability of low-cost multi-antenna devices e.g.
those used in WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) scenarios, allow us to exploit
array-based signal processing techniques for DFL applications as well. Using an
array-capable EM body model, this paper shows how to employ array-based
processing to improve angular detection of targets. Unlike single-antenna
devices that can provide only attenuation information, multi-antenna devices
can provide both angular and attenuation estimates about the target location.
To this end, simulations are presented and preliminary results are discussed.
The proposed framework paves the way for a wider use of multi-antenna devices
based, for instance, on WiFi6 and WiFi7 standards.

the front-end and processing circuitry. Furthermore, the incorporation of
Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) in the Radio Access Network

improved accuracy. Our numerical results demonstrate that an inference

Abstract: Channel estimation is not only essential to highly reliable data transmission
and massive device access but also an important component of the integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile
communication systems. In this paper, we consider a downlink channel estimation
problem for circular reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided
millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple
access (MIMO-NOMA) system in mobility scenarios. First, we propose a subframe
partitioning scheme to facilitate the modeling of the received signal as a
fourth-order tensor satisfying a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) form,
thereby formulating the channel estimation problem as tensor decomposition and
parameter extraction problems. Then, by exploiting both the global and local
low-rank properties of the received signal, we propose a double low-rank 4D
tensor decomposition model to decompose the received signal into four factor
matrices, which is efficiently solved via alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Subsequently, we propose a two-stage parameter estimation
method based on the Jacobi-Anger expansion and the special structure of
circular RIS to uniquely decouple the angle parameters. Furthermore, the time
delay, Doppler shift, and channel gain parameters can also be estimated without
ambiguities, and their estimation accuracy can be efficiently improved,
especially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Finally, a concise closed-form
expression for the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) is derived as a performance
benchmark. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method compared with the other discussed methods.

Result: 数值模拟显示，该方法优于现有宽带和窄带估计技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为XL-MIMO雷达在SWE条件下的实时高效处理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Extremely Large-Scale (XL) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna
systems combined with ultra-wide signal bandwidth (BW) offer the potential for
ultra-high-resolution sensing in frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW)
radars. However, the use of ultra-wide BW results in significant spatial delays
across the array aperture, comparable to the range resolution, leading to the
spatial wideband effect (SWE). SWE introduces coupling between the range and
angle domains, rendering conventional narrowband signal processing techniques
ineffective for target signature estimation. In this paper, we propose an
efficient super-resolution signature estimation technique for XL-MIMO FMCW
radars operating under SWE, leveraging compressive sensing (CS) methods. The
proposed 2D CS-based approach offers low computational complexity, making it
highly suitable for real-time applications in large-scale radar systems.
Numerical simulation results validate the superior performance of the proposed
method compared to existing wideband and narrowband estimation techniques.

Conclusion: 利用q度量空间的性质优化向量搜索，能显著提升经典算法的性能。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of vector search applications, prevailing search
algorithms overlook the metric structure of vector embeddings, treating it as a
constraint rather than exploiting its underlying properties. In this paper, we
demonstrate that in $q$-metric spaces, metric trees can leverage a stronger
version of the triangle inequality to reduce comparisons for exact search.
Notably, as $q$ approaches infinity, the search complexity becomes logarithmic.
Therefore, we propose a novel projection method that embeds vector datasets
with arbitrary dissimilarity measures into $q$-metric spaces while preserving
the nearest neighbor. We propose to learn an approximation of this projection
to efficiently transform query points to a space where euclidean distances
satisfy the desired properties. Our experimental results with text and image
vector embeddings show that learning $q$-metric approximations enables classic
metric tree algorithms -- which typically underperform with high-dimensional
data -- to achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art search
methods.

Abstract: Sensor systems are extremely popular today and vulnerable to sensor data
attacks. Due to possible devastating consequences, counteracting sensor data
attacks is an extremely important topic, which has not seen sufficient study.
This paper develops the first methods that accurately identify/eliminate only
the problematic attacked sensor data presented to a sequence
estimation/regression algorithm under a powerful attack model constructed based
on known/observed attacks. The approach does not assume a known form for the
statistical model of the sensor data, allowing data-driven and machine learning
sequence estimation/regression algorithms to be protected. A simple protection
approach for attackers not endowed with knowledge of the details of our
protection approach is first developed, followed by additional processing for
attacks based on protection system knowledge. In the cases tested for which it
was designed, experimental results show that the simple approach achieves
performance indistinguishable, to two decimal places, from that for an approach
which knows which sensors are attacked. For cases where the attacker has
knowledge of the protection approach, experimental results indicate the
additional processing can be configured so that the worst-case degradation
under the additional processing and a large number of sensors attacked can be
made significantly smaller than the worst-case degradation of the simple
approach, and close to an approach which knows which sensors are attacked, for
the same number of attacked sensors with just a slight degradation under no
attacks. Mathematical descriptions of the worst-case attacks are used to
demonstrate the additional processing will provide similar advantages for cases
for which we do not have numerical results. All the data-driven processing used
in our approaches employ only unattacked training data.
