Conventional\napproaches require relating the channel and its programmable parameters via a\nsimple model that supports rapid optimization, e.g., re-tuning the parameters\neach time the users move. However, in practice such models are often crude\napproximations of the channel, and a more faithful description can be obtained\nvia complex simulators, or only by measurements. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel approach for rapid optimization of programmable channels based on\nAI-aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD), which bypasses the need for explicit\nchannel modeling. By framing the ALD algorithm using the MAP estimate, we\ndesign a deep unfolded ALD algorithm that leverages a Deep Neural Network (DNN)\nto estimate score gradients for optimizing channel parameters. We introduce a\ntraining method that overcomes the need for channel modeling using zero-order\ngradients, combined with active learning to enhance generalization, enabling\noptimization in complex and dynamically changing environments. We evaluate the\nproposed method in RIS-aided scenarios subject to rich-scattering effects. Our\nresults demonstrate that our AI-aided ALD method enables rapid and reliable\nchannel parameter tuning with limited latency."}
