### [1] [Derivative-Free Optimization-Empowered Wireless Channel Reconfiguration for 6G](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02243)
*Peilan Wang,Jun Fang,Xianlong Zeng,Bin Wang,Zhi Chen,Yonina C. Eldar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无导数优化（零阶优化）技术，用于直接优化可重构天线的系数，无需复杂的信道建模和环境参数估计，展示了其在RIS和MA-SISO系统中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可重构天线在6G通信中优化实时可调系数以实现理想信道的挑战，避免复杂的信道建模和隐式参数估计。

Conclusion: 零阶优化为可重构天线技术提供了新的研究方向，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Reconfigurable antennas, including reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS),
movable antenna (MA), fluid antenna (FA), and other advanced antenna
techniques, have been studied extensively in the context of reshaping wireless
propagation environments for 6G and beyond wireless communications.
Nevertheless, how to reconfigure/optimize the real-time controllable
coefficients to achieve a favorable end-to-end wireless channel remains a
substantial challenge, as it usually requires accurate modeling of the complex
interaction between the reconfigurable devices and the electromagnetic waves,
as well as knowledge of implicit channel propagation parameters. In this paper,
we introduce a derivative-free optimization (a.k.a., zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization) technique to directly optimize reconfigurable coefficients to
shape the wireless end-to-end channel, without the need of channel modeling and
estimation of the implicit environmental propagation parameters. We present the
fundamental principles of ZO optimization and discuss its potential advantages
in wireless channel reconfiguration. Two case studies for RIS and movable
antenna-enabled single-input single-output (SISO) systems are provided to show
the superiority of ZO-based methods as compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
Finally, we outline promising future research directions and offer concluding
insights on derivative-free optimization for reconfigurable antenna
technologies.

### [2] [Localized kernel method for separation of linear chirps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02262)
*Eric Mason,Sippanon Kitimoon,Hrushikesh Mhaskar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的信号分离算子(SSO)方法，用于在交叉、低信噪比(SNR)和信号不连续的情况下分离啁啾信号，并通过理论分析和数值实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对信号处理中信号分量的分离问题，尤其是在音频和雷达信号处理中遇到的挑战，本文旨在改进现有的信号分离方法，以应对更复杂的实际场景。

Method: 改进的信号分离算子(SSO)方法，通过理论分析探讨了最小分离距离、最小幅度、信噪比(SNR)和采样频率之间的关系，并在模拟数据集上进行了数值验证。

Result: 数值实验表明，改进后的SSO方法在包含7个模拟信号的仿真数据集中表现良好，能够有效处理交叉、低信噪比和不连续的情况。

Conclusion: 研究证实了改进的信号分离算子方法在实际复杂环境中的适用性，为信号处理领域提供了一种有效的工具。

Abstract: The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual
components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing
applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous
paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator
(SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such
superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In
this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp
signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We
give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to
examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude,
SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and
numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated
signals.

Abstract: This study examines an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
transceiver featuring a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable
intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and a receiver equipped with a passive
electronically scanned array (PESA) and a single digital channel. By utilizing
a periodic pulsed signal emitted by a feeder, we introduce at the STAR-RIS a
space modulation to illuminate two angular directions observed by the radar
receiver, one in each half-space, and a time modulation to distinguish the
corresponding echoes from prospective moving targets and embed communication
messages. The proposed time modulation employs orthogonal binary codebooks with
different trade-offs in transmission and error rates, while having minimal
impact on the radar performance, evaluated by probability of detection and root
mean square error in the radial velocity estimation.

### [4] [Joint Radiation Power, Antenna Position, and Beamforming Optimization for Pinching-Antenna Systems with Motion Power Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02348)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出一种考虑了天线移动功耗和可调辐射功率的捏合天线系统（PASS），通过优化天线位置、辐射功率比和传输波束成形，最小化平均功耗以满足服务质量要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PASS研究忽视了天线放置的物理限制和固定辐射功率，因此本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用ADMM框架解决连续天线移动优化问题，BCD方法解决离散天线移动的MINLP问题。

Result: 模拟结果显示，提出的优化框架显著提升了PASS性能，优于传统MIMO系统。

Conclusion: PASS在减少大规模路径损耗和用户间干扰方面具有显著优势，验证了优化设计的有效性。

Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have been recently proposed to improve the
performance of wireless networks by reconfiguring both the large-scale and
small-scale channel conditions. However, existing studies ignore the physical
constraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To
fill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into
account the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact
of adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average
power consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly
optimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit
beamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to
consider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional
degree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and
discrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the
fact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the
channel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To
tackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for
continuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a
mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block
coordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance
enhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and
adjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the
efficiency of the proposed optimization framework. The benefits of PASS over
conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in mitigating the
large-scale path loss and inter-user interference is also revealed.

Abstract: This study considers a base station equipped with sensing and communication
capabilities, which serves a ground user and scans a portion of the sky via a
passive reconfigurable intelligent surface. To achieve more favorable system
tradeoffs, we utilize a multi-frame radar detector, comprising a detector, a
plot-extractor, and a track-before-detect processor. The main idea proposed
here is that user spectral efficiency can be enhanced by increasing the number
of scans jointly processed by the multi-frame radar detector while maintaining
the same sensing performance. A numerical analysis is conducted to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed solution and to evaluate the achievable system
tradeoffs.

### [6] [Predictive Control over LAWN: Joint Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02374)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LAWN作为物联网系统的灵活平台，需要支持延迟敏感的实时控制应用，无人机与多AGV的协同控制成为关键挑战。

Method: 采用模型预测控制（MPC）分析通信可靠性，基于有限块长传输推导中断概率闭式解，并将问题转化为QP形式，使用交替优化框架结合PGD和SCA技术求解。

Result: 仿真和实验表明，所提方法在控制性能上优于基线方案。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化控制策略、功率分配和无人机轨迹，有效提升了LAWN系统中的实时控制性能。

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have been envisioned as flexible and
transformative platforms for enabling delay-sensitive control applications in
Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In this work, we investigate the real-time
wireless control over a LAWN system, where an aerial drone is employed to serve
multiple mobile automated guided vehicles (AGVs) via finite blocklength (FBL)
transmission. Toward this end, we adopt the model predictive control (MPC) to
ensure accurate trajectory tracking, while we analyze the communication
reliability using the outage probability. Subsequently, we formulate an
optimization problem to jointly determine control policy, transmit power
allocation, and drone trajectory by accounting for the maximum travel distance
and control input constraints. To address the resultant non-convex optimization
problem, we first derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability
under FBL transmission. Based on this, we reformulate the original problem as a
quadratic programming (QP) problem, followed by developing an alternating
optimization (AO) framework. Specifically, we employ the projected gradient
descent (PGD) method and the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to
achieve computationally efficient sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, we
thoroughly analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed
algorithm. Extensive simulations and AirSim-based experiments are conducted to
validate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to the baseline
schemes in terms of control performance.

### [7] [Parameter estimation of range-migrating targets using OTFS signals from LEO satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02385)
*Tong Ding,Luca Venturino,Emanuele Grossi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了一种基于通信的集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统，利用LEO卫星发射的OTFS调制信号估计高速空间目标的参数，提出了一种新的输入输出模型和稀疏结构的最大似然估计实现方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出了一种新的输入输出模型，利用OTFS收发器的信号处理特性，并通过块正交匹配追踪算法和匹配滤波器库实现目标参数的粗估计与精炼。

Result: 研究发现目标响应在时延多普勒域具有稀疏结构，且距离迁移会导致响应扩展；数值实验验证了所提方法的估计性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了高速目标参数估计问题，为ISAC系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This study investigates a communication-centric integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system that utilizes orthogonal time frequency space
(OTFS) modulated signals emitted by low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to
estimate the parameters of space targets experiencing range migration,
henceforth referred to as high-speed targets. Leveraging the specific signal
processing performed by OTFS transceivers, we derive a novel input-output model
for the echo generated by a high-speed target in scenarios where ideal and
rectangular shaping filters are employed. Our findings reveal that the target
response exhibits a sparse structure in the delay-Doppler domain, dependent
solely upon the initial range and range-rate; notably, range migration causes a
spread in the target response, marking a significant departure from previous
studies. Utilizing this signal structure, we propose an approximate
implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the target's initial
range, range-rate, and amplitude. The estimation process involves obtaining
coarse information on the target response using a block orthogonal matching
pursuit algorithm, followed by a refinement step using a bank of matched
filters focused on a smaller range and range-rate region. Finally, numerical
examples are provided to evaluate the estimation performance.

### [8] [When Attention is Beneficial for Learning Wireless Resource Allocation Efficiently?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02427)
*Jia Guo,Chenyang Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了注意力机制在资源分配中的必要性，并通过分析集合函数和数值算法的结构，证明了在某些情况下注意力机制可以替换为其他函数，从而提出了一种新的GNN设计框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨注意力机制在无线资源分配中是否必要，并通过分析集合函数和算法结构，提出更高效的GNN设计框架。

Method: 通过理论分析和算法重构，证明注意力机制的替代性，并设计了一种新的GNN框架，结合数值算法的结构特性。

Result: 研究发现，当干扰未反映在可测参数中时，注意力机制是必要的；否则可以替换。提出的GNN框架在模拟中验证了高效性。

Conclusion: 结论是注意力机制在特定场景下可替换，提出的GNN设计框架能显著提升学习效率。

Abstract: Owing to the use of attention mechanism to leverage the dependency across
tokens, Transformers are efficient for natural language processing. By
harnessing permutation properties broadly exist in resource allocation
policies, each mapping measurable environmental parameters (e.g., channel
matrix) to optimized variables (e.g., precoding matrix), graph neural networks
(GNNs) are promising for learning these policies efficiently in terms of
scalability and generalizability. To reap the benefits of both architectures,
there is a recent trend of incorporating attention mechanism with GNNs for
learning wireless policies. Nevertheless, is the attention mechanism really
needed for resource allocation? In this paper, we strive to answer this
question by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical
algorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are
induced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the
permutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed
by two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not. We
proceed to re-express the numerical algorithms for optimizing several
representative resource allocation problems in recursive forms. We find that
when interference (say multi-user or inter-data stream interference) is not
reflected in the measurable parameters of a policy, attention needs to be used
to model the interference. With the insight, we establish a framework of
designing GNNs by aligning with the structures. By taking reconfigurable
intelligent surface-aided hybrid precoding as an example, the learning
efficiency of the proposed GNN is validated via simulations.

### [9] [Corrections to Published Values of Frequency Sampling Filter Transition Coefficients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02556)
*C. S. Ramalingam*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文指出Rabiner等人和Lyons的文献中关于频率采样滤波器设计的转换系数和峰值旁瓣电平（PSL）数据存在错误，并提供了通过程序计算得到的最优值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为现有文献中关于频率采样滤波器设计的转换系数和PSL数据不一致，且未达到最优值，本文旨在纠正这些错误并提供准确的最优值。

Method: 通过编程计算重新评估了低通和带通滤波器的转换系数和PSL值，并与Rabiner等人及Lyons的数据进行对比。

Result: 发现现有文献中的转换系数和PSL值均不准确，本文提供了更优的数值，例如$N=16$和$BW=4$时的最优转换系数为$0.40474097$。

Conclusion: 本文通过计算得出更精确的转换系数和PSL值，纠正了文献中的错误，为频率采样滤波器设计提供了更可靠的数据。

Abstract: Tables of optimal transition coefficients and peak sidelobe level (PSL, in
dB) associated with frequency sampling filter (FSF) design were published by
Rabiner et al. (Jun 1970), and reproduced, for example, in the book Digital
Signal Processing by Proakis and Manolakis (4/e, 2007). A set of values are
also given in Appendix H of Understanding Digital Signal Processing} by Lyons
(3/e, 2011), but there are significant differences between these two sets. For
example, for $N=16$ and BW$=4$, two different transition coefficient values
have been reported, viz., $0.38916626$ (Rabiner, et al.) and $0.34918551$
(Lyons). Neither is optimal, for we find the optimum value to be $0.40474097$.
The published values of the corresponding PSLs were also found to be incorrect.
In this paper we give the optimal values of the transition coefficients and PSL
values as estimated by our program for the lowpass and bandpass filters listed
in Rabiner et al. and Lyons.

### [10] [Pinching-Antenna-Assisted Index Modulation: Channel Modeling, Transceiver Design, and Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02641)
*Shuaixin Yang,Yijia Li,Yue Xiao,Yong Liang Guan,Xianfu Lei,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的pinching-antenna辅助索引调制方案（PA-IM），不仅通过传统QAM符号传输信息，还通过PA位置模式索引提升频谱效率，同时设计了低复杂度检测算法和预编码方法以优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在硬件复杂度不增加的情况下提高频谱效率。

Method: 提出PA-IM方案，设计低复杂度BOSD检测算法，进行曼哈顿优化的预编码设计，以最大化接收信号的最小欧氏距离。

Result: 仿真结果显示PA-IM方案显著优于传统方案，BER通过预编码设计得到大幅改善。

Conclusion: PA-IM方案在频谱效率和性能优化方面具有显著优势，适用于未来无线通信系统。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel pinching-antenna assisted index modulation (PA-IM)
scheme is proposed for improving the spectral efficiency without increasing the
hardware complexity, where the information bits are conveyed not only by the
conventional M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols but also by
the indices of pinching antenna (PA) position patterns. To realize the full
potential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver
design, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and
performance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel
model is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the
deterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of
wireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading.
Next, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML)
detection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is
designed, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML
performance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER)
is derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding
method is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by
jointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the
waveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all
received signal points. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed PA-IM scheme attains a significant performance gain over its
conventional counterparts and that the overall BER of the pinching-antenna
system is substantially improved by the proposed precoding design.

*Jiazhe Li,Nicolò Decarli,Francesco Guidi,Heng Dong,Anna Guerra,Alessandro Bazzi,Zhuoming Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了交替残差消除算法（AREE），以解决混合波束成形中模拟和数字预编码器耦合问题，提高了计算和频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合波束成形在毫米波通信（如V2X场景）中广泛使用，但模拟和数字预编码器的固有耦合限制了算法的效率和性能。

Method: 将混合波束成形问题分解为两个低维子问题，通过交替残差消除迭代优化，并采用几何信道SVD算法简化问题。

Result: AREE算法能有效解耦预编码器，快速收敛，且频谱效率高于现有方法。

Conclusion: AREE算法为混合波束成形提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid beamforming has been widely employed in mmWave communications such as
vehicular-to-everything (V2X) scenarios, as a compromise between hardware
complexity and spectral efficiency. However, the inherent coupling between
analog and digital precoders in hybrid array architecture significantly limits
the computational and spectral efficiency of existing algorithms. To address
this issue, we propose an alternating residual error elimination (AREE)
algorithm, which decomposes the hybrid beamforming problem into two
low-dimensional subproblems, each exhibiting a favorable matrix structure that
enables effective decoupling of analog and digital precoders from the matrix
product formulation. These subproblems iteratively eliminate each other's
residual errors, driving the original problem toward the optimal hybrid
beamforming performance. The proposed initialization ensures rapid convergence,
while a low-complexity geometric channel SVD algorithm is developed by
transforming the high-dimensional sparse channel into a low-dimensional
equivalent, thereby simplifying the derivation of subproblems. Simulation
results demonstrate that the AREE algorithm effectively decouples analog and
digital precoders with low complexity, achieves fast convergence, and offers
higher spectral efficiency than existing beamforming methods.

*Po-Heng Chou,Ching-Wen Chen,Wan-Jen Huang,Walid Saad,Yu Tsao,Ronald Y. Chang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了使用RIS增强mmWave MIMO系统吞吐量的预编码设计，提出基于DNN的码字选择方法以减少计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如穷举搜索）在高连续相位偏移时计算复杂度高，影响实际应用，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 采用离散傅里叶变换向量设计码本，并训练DNN加速码字选择。

Result: 仿真表明DNN在距离变化时仍能保持次优频谱效率。

Conclusion: DNN在RIS辅助系统中具有提升性能的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

*Maryem Fadili,Mohamed Anis Ghaoui,Louis Lecrosnier,Steve Pechberti,Redouane Khemmar*

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的晚期协作框架，用于3D多源多目标融合，无需访问检测模型即可显著降低误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有协作感知方法依赖高带宽通信和模型共享的实际限制。

Method: 基于共享的3D边界框属性进行晚期融合，无需直接访问检测模型。

Result: 位置误差降低5倍，尺度误差减少7.5倍，方向误差减半，同时保持100%的精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 该框架为高效、可扩展的多智能体融合设定了新基准。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

*Mona Mostafa,Ramy H. Gohary,Amr El-Keyi,Yahia A. Eldemerdash Ahmed*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出两种方法在混合模拟/数字接收器中解决小样本下方向估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因样本量小、模拟组合器纠缠及低维投影导致的DoA估计问题。

Method: 两种方法：1) 通用方法，依赖周期性信号；2) 仅适用于PC-HAD，利用块对角线结构。

Result: 数值模拟验证了方法的优越性，并与Cramér-Rao界比较。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效克服了HAD接收器中的DoA估计难题。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to estimate the directions of arrival (DoAs) for
hybrid analog/digital (HAD) receivers when the number of snapshots is too small
for statistical averaging to be reliable. This goal is achieved in
fully-digital receivers by employing the matrix pencil method (MPM).
Unfortunately, the MPM cannot be directly applied in HAD receivers because of
the entanglement induced by the underlying analog combiners on the output
signals. Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a
low-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from
particular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two
approaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two
approaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by
cycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the
entire space. The first approach can be applied to both fully-connected (FC)
and partially-connected (PC) HADs and relies on the availability of periodic,
potentially unknown, signals to disentangle the output of the HAD receiver. The
second approach applies to PC-HADs only, and eliminates contingency on periodic
signals by exploiting the underlying block diagonal structure. The superiority
of the proposed approaches is demonstrated via numerical simulations and
comparisons with the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound.

management tasks, the large language model (LLM) optimizer framework, which
leverages pretrained LLMs as optimization agents, has recently been promoted as
a promising solution. This framework utilizes natural language prompts
describing the given optimization problems along with past solutions generated
by LLMs themselves. As a result, LLMs can obtain efficient solutions
autonomously without knowing the mathematical models of the objective
functions. Although the viability of the LLM optimizer (LLMO) framework has
been studied in various black-box scenarios, it has so far been limited to
numerical simulations. For the first time, this paper establishes a theoretical
foundation for the LLMO framework. With careful investigations of LLM inference
steps, we can interpret the LLMO procedure as a finite-state Markov chain, and
prove the convergence of the framework. Our results are extended to a more
advanced multiple LLM architecture, where the impact of multiple LLMs is
rigorously verified in terms of the convergence rate. Comprehensive numerical
simulations validate our theoretical results and provide a deeper understanding
of the underlying mechanisms of the LLMO framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ISAC在SHM中的应用潜力，解决多径干扰和超高精度需求的挑战。

Method: 利用RIS作为参考点，动态调整相位抑制干扰，使用Fisher信息理论分析协作感知，并通过贝叶斯推理模型识别结构状态。

Result: 理论和数值分析证实ISAC可实现毫米级变形检测，满足SHM的高精度需求。

Conclusion: RIS辅助的ISAC框架为高精度SHM提供了可行的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of future
cellular systems, enabling applications such as intruder detection, monitoring,
and tracking using the same infrastructure. However, its potential for
structural health monitoring (SHM), which requires the detection of slow and
subtle structural changes, remains largely unexplored due to challenges such as
multipath interference and the need for ultra-high sensing precision. This
study introduces a novel theoretical framework for SHM via ISAC by leveraging
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as reference points in collaboration
with base stations and users. By dynamically adjusting RIS phases to generate
distinct radio signals that suppress background multipath interference,
measurement accuracy at these reference points is enhanced. We theoretically
analyze RIS-aided collaborative sensing in three-dimensional cellular networks
using Fisher information theory, demonstrating how increasing observation time,
incorporating additional receivers (even with self-positioning errors),
optimizing RIS phases, and refining collaborative node selection can reduce the
position error bound to meet SHM's stringent accuracy requirements.
Furthermore, we develop a Bayesian inference model to identify structural
states and validate damage detection probabilities. Both theoretical and
numerical analyses confirm ISAC's capability for millimeter-level deformation
detection, highlighting its potential for high-precision SHM applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于信道感知的语义通信框架，以提升车联网数据传播的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车联网产生的海量数据需要实时高效传输，但动态无线信道条件导致挑战。

Method: 采用语义通信模型提取和压缩信息，并用生成扩散模型预测动态信道状态，结合大模型微调以适应新场景。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上评估了框架的性能和可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效提升车联网服务的质量。

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) transforms the transportation ecosystem
promising pervasive connectivity and data-driven approaches. Deep learning and
generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly
enhance the operation of applications within IoV by facilitating efficient
decision-making and predictive capabilities, including intelligent navigation,
vehicle safety monitoring, accident prevention, and intelligent traffic
management. Nevertheless, efficiently transmitting and processing the massive
volumes of data generated by the IoV in real-time remains a significant
challenge, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable wireless channel
conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a semantic
communication framework based on channel perception to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of data transmission. The semantic communication model extracts and
compresses the information to be transmitted. In addition, the wireless channel
is estimated by using a generative diffusion model, which is employed to
predict the dynamic channel states, thereby improving the quality of IoV
service. In dynamic scenarios, however, the channel estimation performance may
be degraded when substantially new scenarios take place, which will adversely
affect user experience. To mitigate this limitation, we employ a large model to
fine-tune the channel generation model to enhance its adaptability for varying
scenarios. The performance and reliability of the proposed framework are
evaluated on the two public datasets.

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于5G PRS的多站ISAC信号处理链能够有效实现高保真的移动目标跟踪。

Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference
Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits
a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers
exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and
tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a
range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are
extracted for every target. For a single target, the resulting bistatic delays
are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric
position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed
equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are
obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account
for time synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving
target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to
standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results
show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G
PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.

Conclusion: 自适应ISTA在理论上具有可靠的性质，为其在实际应用中的有效性提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular
algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without
explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the
adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results
exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA
with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute
deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including
scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear
convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究α稳定随机投影的性质，为稀疏恢复问题提供更一般的理论框架。

Method: 利用对称α稳定(SαS)变量的经验分数矩浓度不等式和稀疏ℓα球的覆盖数界。

Result: 得出了满足RQIP的样本复杂度，反映了多项式尾部行为的浓度特性。

Conclusion: RIP框架可能需要替换为其他稀疏恢复方法，如基于零空间性质的方案。

Abstract: We formulate a generalization of the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)
referred to as the Restricted Quasiconvexity Isometry Property (RQIP) for alpha
stable random projections with $0<\alpha<1$. A lower bound on the number of
rows for RQIP to hold for random matrices whose entries are drawn from a
symmetric $\alpha$-stable ($S\alpha S$) distribution is derived. The proof
leverages two key components: a concentration inequality for empirical
fractional moments of $S\alpha S$ variables and a covering number bound for
sparse $\ell_\alpha$ balls. The resulting sample complexity reflects the
polynomial tail behavior of the concentration and reinforces an observation
made in the literature that the RIP framework may have to be replaced with
other sparse recovery formulations in practice, such as those based on the null
space property.

Conclusion: 该方法为空间受限的高速互连提供了一种可行的THz通信解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient chip-scale interconnects are essential for modern
microelectronic-photonic systems, supporting high bandwidth and low-latency
processing. Traditional wired links face high resistivity and latency, while
millimeter-wave wireless solutions suffer from bandwidth congestion and
interference. Terahertz (THz) plasmonic communication, based on surface plasmon
polaritons (SPPs), offers high data rates and broad bandwidth, and is
compatible with nanophotonic platforms. This work introduces a Binary
Field-Driven Meta-Routing Method supported by a semi-analytical framework that
models the tunable interaction between THz plasmonic phenomena and graphene's
electromagnetic properties. By modulating graphene's impedance, the method
enables dynamic coupling and routing of localized surface plasmon resonances
(LSPRs) across a meta-network, facilitating real-time beam steering in
chip-scale systems. Combining analytical conductivity models, coupled-mode
theory, and algorithmic control, the approach enables predictive configuration
of LSPR-based steering in reconfigurable graphene metasurfaces. Four meta-pixel
antenna configurations Y-MetaRouter, MetaSwitcher, Penta-MetaEmitter, and
CP-MetaCore are designed to support unidirectional radiation, bi-directional
steering, frequency-driven transitions, and circular polarization,
respectively. Chemical potential modulation creates reconfigurable LSPR
pathways and virtual SPP channels. A Coupled-Mode Theory for Field-Driven LSPR
Meta-Networks is proposed to model current distributions and predict far-field
characteristics. Results show strong agreement between theory and full-wave
simulations. A point-to-point meta-wireless link is analyzed, demonstrating
scalability for low-latency, high-performance THz communication in WiNoC and
chiplet applications. System-level metrics confirm feasibility for
space-constrained, high-speed interconnects.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效估计MNT参数，实际应用中端到端性能影响较小。

Abstract: Physics-consistent theoretical studies on RIS-parametrized wireless channels
use models from multiport-network theory (MNT) to capture mutual-coupling (MC)
effects. However, in practice, RIS design and radio environment are partially
or completely unknown. We fill a research gap on how to estimate the MNT model
parameters in such experimentally relevant scenarios. Our technique efficiently
combines closed-form and gradient-descent steps, and it can be applied to
multi-bit-programmable RIS elements. We discuss inevitable (but operationally
irrelevant) parameter ambiguities. We experimentally validate our technique in
an unknown rich-scattering environment parametrized by eight 8-bit-programmable
RIS elements of unknown design. We experimentally evaluate the performance of
RIS configurations optimized with the estimated MNT model and an MC-unaware
cascaded model. While the models differ in accuracy by up to 17 dB, the
end-to-end performance differences are small.
