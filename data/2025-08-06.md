### [1] [An AI-driven EDA Algorithm-Empowered VCO and LDO Co-Design Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02687)
*Yijia Hao,Maarten Strackx,Miguel Gandara,Sandy Cochran,Bo Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种AI驱动的EDA算法，用于LDO供电的LC-tank VCO的协同设计，优化了相位噪声和功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LDO设计方法无法完全解决高频和低频相位噪声之间的权衡问题，因此需要一种协同设计方法。

Method: 使用AI驱动的EDA算法进行LDO和LC-tank VCO的协同设计。

Result: 在65 nm CMOS工艺下设计的5.6 GHz LC-tank VCO显示出相位噪声改善1.2 dB，动态功耗降低28.8%，FoM提升2.4 dBc/Hz。

Conclusion: 协同设计方法显著优于传统顺序设计方法，特别是在相位噪声和功耗方面。

Abstract: Traditionally, the output noise and power supply rejection of low-dropout
regulators (LDOs) are optimized to minimize power supply fluctuations, reducing
their impact on the low-frequency noise of target voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs). However, this sequential design approach does not fully
address the trade-offs between high-frequency and LDO-induced low-frequency
phase noise. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a co-design
method for low phase-noise LC-tank VCOs powered by LDOs. It is difficult to
carry out the co-design using traditional manual design techniques. Hence, an
efficient AI-driven EDA algorithm is used. To validate the proposed method, a
5.6 GHz LC-tank VCO with an integrated LDO is designed using a 65 nm CMOS
process. Simulations show that the co-design method improves phase noise by 1.2
dB at a 1 MHz offset and reduces dynamic power consumption by 28.8%, with FoM
increased by 2.4 dBc/Hz compared to the conventional sequential design method.

### [2] [On Improving PPG-Based Sleep Staging: A Pilot Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02689)
*Jiawei Wang,Yu Guan,Chen Chen,Ligang Zhou,Laurence T. Yang,Sai Gu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究通过双流交叉注意力架构结合PPG及其辅助信息提升睡眠分期性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG传感器虽广泛应用，但仅靠PPG实现可靠的睡眠分期仍具挑战。研究旨在探索方法以提升PPG睡眠分期性能。

Method: 比较单流模型与双流交叉注意力策略，利用PPG及其衍生模态（如增强PPG或合成ECG）学习互补信息。

Result: 在MESA数据集上实验表明，双流架构结合PPG及辅助信息显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 双流交叉注意力架构有效利用PPG及辅助信息，显著提升了睡眠分期准确性。

Abstract: Sleep monitoring through accessible wearable technology is crucial to
improving well-being in ubiquitous computing. Although
photoplethysmography(PPG) sensors are widely adopted in consumer devices,
achieving consistently reliable sleep staging using PPG alone remains a
non-trivial challenge. In this work, we explore multiple strategies to enhance
the performance of PPG-based sleep staging. Specifically, we compare
conventional single-stream model with dual-stream cross-attention strategies,
based on which complementary information can be learned via PPG and PPG-derived
modalities such as augmented PPG or synthetic ECG. To study the effectiveness
of the aforementioned approaches in four-stage sleep monitoring task, we
conducted experiments on the world's largest sleep staging dataset, i.e., the
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis(MESA). We found that substantial
performance gain can be achieved by combining PPG and its auxiliary information
under the dual-stream cross-attention architecture. Source code of this project

### [3] [Federated Learning in Active STARS-Aided Uplink Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02693)
*Xinwei Yue,Xinning Guo,Xidong Mu,Jingjing Zhao,Peng Yang,Junsheng Mu,Zhiping Lu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用主动同时发射和反射表面（ASTARS）辅助联邦学习（FL）上行链路模型传输的方法，通过空中计算（OTA）技术减少上传参数数量，并分析了模型聚合误差对FL性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过ASTARS解决多路径衰落问题并重塑全空间电磁环境，同时提升FL的上行链路模型传输效率和减少参数上传量。

Method: 通过OTA计算技术减少上传参数数量，并量化了通信误差对训练损失的影响；定义了包含接收波束分配和ASTARS相移优化的联合优化问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，ASTARS辅助的FL上行链路网络在准确性上优于现有方法，尤其在离散数据集中表现更好，但过高的放大功率会导致热噪声成为主要误差源。

Conclusion: ASTARS显著提升了FL的准确性和效率，尤其在参数上传和信号传输质量方面，但需平衡放大功率以避免噪声干扰。

Abstract: Active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surfaces (ASTARS) have
attracted growing research interest due to its ability to alleviate
multiplicative fading and reshape the electromagnetic environment across the
entire space. In this paper, we utilise ASTARS to assist the federated learning
(FL) uplink model transfer and further reduce the number of uploaded parameter
counts through over-the-air (OTA) computing techniques. The impact of model
aggregation errors on ASTARS-aided FL uplink networks is characterized. We
derive an upper bound on the aggregation error of the OTA-FL model and quantify
the training loss due to communication errors. Then, we define the performance
of OTA-FL as a joint optimization problem that encompasses both the assignment
of received beams and the phase shifting of ASTARS, aiming to achieve the
maximum learning efficiency and high-quality signal transmission. Numerical
results demonstrate that: i) The FL accuracy in ASTARS uplink networks are
enhanced compared to that in state-of-the-art networks; ii) The ASTARS enabled
FL system achieves the better learning accuracy using fewer active units than
other baseline, especially when the dataset is more discrete; and iii) FL
accuracy improves with higher amplification power, but excessive amplification
makes thermal noise the dominant source of error.

### [4] [A Completely Blind Channel Estimation Technique for OFDM Using Constellation Splitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02698)
*Sameera Bharadwaja H.,D. K. Mehra*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于二阶统计量的OFDM系统盲信道估计算法，通过频域线性非冗余预编码和交替子载波上的星座分裂解决了现有方法中的复数标量估计模糊性问题，性能与半盲方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于二阶统计量的盲信道估计方法通常存在复数标量估计模糊性问题，需依赖导频或参考符号解决，本文旨在提出一种纯盲方法解决这一问题。

Method: 采用频域线性非冗余预编码和交替子载波上的星座分裂技术，设计了一种新的盲信道估计算法。

Result: MATLAB仿真表明，所提方法在M进制PAM系统中的性能与半盲方法相当。

Conclusion: 所提算法成功解决了复数标量估计模糊性问题，为OFDM系统提供了一种高效的盲信道估计方案。

Abstract: The problem of second-order statistics (SOS)-based blind channel estimation
in OFDM systems is addressed in this paper. Almost all SOS-based methods
proposed so far suffer from a complex-scalar estimation ambiguity, which is
resolved by using pilots or reference symbols. We propose an algorithm to
resolve this ambiguity in blind manner using frequency-domain linear
non-redundant precoding and constellation-splitting among the alternate
subcarriers. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via numerical
simulations in MATLAB environment. Simulation results show that the proposed
approach performs as good as its semi-blind counterpart for M-ary PAM systems.

### [5] [Measuring Dependencies between Biological Signals with Temporal Self-supervision, and its Limitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02703)
*Evangelos Sariyanidi,John D. Herrington,Lisa Yankowitz,Pratik Chaudhari,Theodore D. Satterthwaite,Casey J. Zampella,Robert T. Schultz,Russell T. Shinohara,Birkan Tunc*

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物系统常表现出复杂的非线性交互，现有方法无法捕获这些依赖关系而无需先验知识。因此，论文旨在提出一种无需先验信息的通用依赖测量方法。

Method: 提出自监督方法‘concurrence’，基于信号间依赖时能区分时间对齐与不对齐的观察。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能广泛发现fMRI、生理和行为信号间的依赖关系，无需调参或先验信息。

Conclusion: ‘concurrence’为科学发现提供了强大工具，但仍需验证依赖关系是否与研究问题相关。

Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary
tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit
complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a
priori knowledge regarding the nature of dependence. We introduce a
self-supervised approach, concurrence, which is inspired by the observation
that if two signals are dependent, then one should be able to distinguish
between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them.
Experiments with fMRI, physiological and behavioral signals show that, to our
knowledge, concurrence is the first approach that can expose relationships
across such a wide spectrum of signals and extract scientifically relevant
differences without ad-hoc parameter tuning or reliance on a priori
information, providing a potent tool for scientific discoveries across fields.
However, depencencies caused by extraneous factors remain an open problem, thus
researchers should validate that exposed relationships truely pertain to the
question(s) of interest.

### [7] [Physics-guided denoiser network for enhanced additive manufacturing data quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02712)
*Pallock Halder,Satyajit Mojumder*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理模型和Fisher评分的去噪框架，用于降低传感器噪声并保持物理一致性，在添加剂制造中效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工程系统传感器数据噪声大、难以解释，影响了控制和诊断的实用性。

Method: 采用基于能量的模型和Fisher评分正则化联合去噪，并结合物理模型进行验证和应用。

Result: 在基准问题和实际LPBF实验中，该方法优于基线神经网络去噪器。

Conclusion: 物理引导的去噪策略能实时解释低成本传感器数据，提升添加剂制造的预测控制和缺陷缓解。

Abstract: Modern engineering systems are increasingly equipped with sensors for
real-time monitoring and decision-making. However, the data collected by these
sensors is often noisy and difficult to interpret, limiting its utility for
control and diagnostics. In this work, we propose a physics-informed denoising
framework that integrates energy-based model and Fisher score regularization to
jointly reduce data noise and enforce physical consistency with a physics-based
model. The approach is first validated on benchmark problems, including the
simple harmonic oscillator, Burgers' equation, and Laplace's equation, across
varying noise levels. We then apply the denoising framework to real thermal
emission data from laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing
experiments, using a trained Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) surrogate
model of the LPBF process to guide denoising. Results show that the proposed
method outperforms baseline neural network denoisers, effectively reducing
noise under a range of LPBF processing conditions. This physics-guided
denoising strategy enables robust, real-time interpretation of low-cost sensor
data, facilitating predictive control and improved defect mitigation in
additive manufacturing.

### [8] [Precoder Design for User-Centric Network Massive MIMO: A Symplectic Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02713)
*Pengxu Lin,An-An Lu,Xiqi Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于辛优化的预编码器设计方法，用于用户中心网络（UCN）大规模MIMO系统，旨在降低计算复杂度并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCN大规模MIMO系统中，传统线性预编码器的矩阵求逆操作计算复杂度高，需要通过新型优化方法简化设计并提升效率。

Method: 利用辛优化框架将接收模型转换到实数域，并重新构建加权和速率最大化问题，通过耗散哈密顿动力系统解决优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的辛优化预编码器在计算效率和性能上均优于传统的WMMSE预编码器。

Conclusion: 辛优化方法为UCN大规模MIMO系统的预编码器设计提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize symplectic optimization to design a precoder for
user-centric network (UCN) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems, where a subset of base stations (BSs) serves each user terminal (UT)
instead of using all BSs. In UCN massive MIMO systems, the dimension of the
precoders is reduced compared to conventional network massive MIMO. It
simplifies the implementation of precoders in practical systems. However, the
matrix inversion in traditional linear precoders still requires high
computational complexity. To avoid the matrix inversion, we employ the
symplectic optimization framework, where optimization problems are solved based
on dissipative Hamiltonian dynamical systems. To better fit symplectic
optimization, we transform the received model into the real field and
reformulate the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem. The objective
function of the optimization problem is viewed as the potential energy of the
dynamical system. Due to energy dissipation, the continuous dynamical system
always converges to a state with minimal potential energy. By discretizing the
continuous system while preserving the symplectic structure, we obtain an
iterative method for the precoder design. The complexity analysis of the
proposed symplectic method is also provided to show its high computational
efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed precoder design
based on symplectic optimization outperforms the weighted minimum mean-square
error (WMMSE) precoder in the UCN massive MIMO system.

Method: 通过对多种机器学习和深度学习算法的比较，提出了一种专门为穿戴设备设计的轻量级卷积神经网络SleepLiteCNN。

Result: SleepLiteCNN在精度和能耗上表现出色，达到95%的准确率和92%的宏F1分数，单次推理仅需1.8微焦耳。

Conclusion: SleepLiteCNN为穿戴设备提供了一种高效、实用的睡眠呼吸暂停亚型检测方案。

Abstract: Apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by breathing interruptions
lasting at least ten seconds and occurring more than five times per hour.
Accurate, high-temporal-resolution detection of sleep apnea subtypes -
Obstructive, Central, and Mixed - is crucial for effective treatment and
management. This paper presents an energy-efficient method for classifying
these subtypes using a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with high temporal
resolution to address the real-time needs of wearable devices. We evaluate a
wide range of classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning
architectures on 1-second ECG windows, comparing their accuracy, complexity,
and energy consumption. Based on this analysis, we introduce SleepLiteCNN, a
compact and energy-efficient convolutional neural network specifically designed
for wearable platforms. SleepLiteCNN achieves over 95% accuracy and a 92%
macro-F1 score, while requiring just 1.8 microjoules per inference after 8-bit
quantization. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis further
demonstrates significant reductions in hardware resource usage, confirming its
suitability for continuous, real-time monitoring in energy-constrained
environments. These results establish SleepLiteCNN as a practical and effective
solution for wearable device sleep apnea subtype detection.

### [10] [Veli: Unsupervised Method and Unified Benchmark for Low-Cost Air Quality Sensor Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02724)
*Yahia Dalbah,Marcel Worring,Yen-Chia Hsu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Veli是一种无监督贝叶斯模型，用于校正低成本传感器的空气污染读数，无需依赖参考站。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市空气污染严重，低成本传感器（LCS）因易受误差影响而无法完全替代昂贵参考站。

Method: 使用变分推断构建解耦表示，分离真实污染物读数和传感器噪声。

Result: Veli在分布内外均表现良好，能有效处理传感器漂移和异常行为。

Conclusion: Veli为AQ监测提供了可扩展且无需参考站的解决方案，并发布了大型数据集AQ-SDR。

Abstract: Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature
deaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable
monitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable
alternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected
by drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these
challenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent
Inference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference
to correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,
eliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a
disentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the
true pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address
the lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air
Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor
benchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across
multiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor
drift and erratic sensor behavior. Code for model and dataset will be made
public when this paper is published.

### [11] [SpectrumFM: A New Paradigm for Spectrum Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02742)
*Chunyu Liu,Hao Zhang,Wei Wu,Fuhui Zhou,Qihui Wu,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Chan-Byoung Chae*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为SpectrumFM的频谱基础模型，通过创新的频谱编码器和自监督学习任务，显著提升了频谱认知的泛化性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有频谱认知方法在多样化频谱环境和任务中表现不佳，泛化性和准确性有限。

Method: 提出SpectrumFM模型，结合卷积神经网络和多头自注意力机制，设计自监督预训练任务（掩码重建和下一时隙信号预测），并采用低秩自适应（LoRA）微调技术。

Result: SpectrumFM在频谱感知（SS）任务中检测概率提高了30%，异常检测（AD）AUC提升超10%，无线技术分类（WTC）准确率提升9.6%。

Conclusion: SpectrumFM为频谱认知提供了新范式，显著提升了性能和适应性。

Abstract: The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum
utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing
spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal
accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed
SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative
spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the
multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both
fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the
spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning
tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are
developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and
transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly
adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum
sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification
(WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over
state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in
the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under
the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.

*Jessica Sanson,Rahul C. Shah,Maximilian Pinaroc,Valerio Frascolla*

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决利用非全双工设计的Wi-Fi NIC进行感知时的硬件异步和天线耦合问题。

Method: 提出信号处理新方法，包括时间偏移消除、相位对齐校正和收发耦合抑制。

Result: 实现了厘米级精度的距离和多普勒估计，并在商用Intel Wi-Fi AX211 NIC上验证了效果。

Conclusion: 证明了利用标准Wi-Fi硬件无需修改即可实现高精度感知的可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, a method to extract both range and
Doppler information from commercial Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) using
a monostatic (single transceiver) setup. Utilizing the CSI phase in Wi-Fi
sensing from a Network Interface Card (NIC) not designed for full-duplex
operation is challenging due to (1) Hardware asynchronization, which introduces
significant phase errors, and (2) Proximity of transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx)
antennas, which creates strong coupling that overwhelms the motion signal of
interest. We propose a new signal processing approach that addresses both
challenges via three key innovations: Time offset cancellation, Phase alignment
correction, and Tx/Rx coupling mitigation. Our method achieves cm-level
accuracy in range and Doppler estimation for moving targets, validated using a
commercial Intel Wi-Fi AX211 NIC. Our results show successful detection and
tracking of moving objects in realistic environments, establishing the
feasibility of high-precision sensing using standard Wi-Fi packet
communications and off-the-shelf hardware without requiring any modification or
specialized full-duplex capabilities.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新型多模态监控框架，结合声发射传感和同轴相机视觉，用于激光定向能量沉积（DED）增材制造中的熔池动态和零件质量评估，分类性能达94.4%。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的激光DED制造中，熔池动态和工艺变化的复杂性导致零件质量不稳定，现有监测系统对熔池动态和工艺质量的验证不足。

Method: 研究结合声发射传感和同轴相机视觉，对三种零件配置进行实验，包括无孔、3mm孔和5mm孔零件，通过预处理传感器数据，提取特征并使用多种机器学习算法进行分类。

Conclusion: 该集成系统有效捕捉了与几何变化相关的结构振动和表面形貌变化，为未来表征零件几何不准确性和制造缺陷提供了技术基础。

Abstract: Laser directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing struggles with
consistent part quality due to complex melt pool dynamics and process
variations. While much research targets defect detection, little work has
validated process monitoring systems for evaluating melt pool dynamics and
process quality. This study presents a novel multimodal monitoring framework,
synergistically integrating contact-based acoustic emission (AE) sensing with
coaxial camera vision to enable layer-wise identification and evaluation of
geometric variations in DED parts. The experimental study used three part
configurations: a baseline part without holes, a part with a 3mm diameter
through-hole, and one with a 5mm through-hole to test the system's discerning
capabilities. Raw sensor data was preprocessed: acoustic signals were filtered
for time-domain and frequency-domain feature extraction, while camera data
underwent melt pool segmentation and morphological feature extraction. Multiple
machine learning algorithms (including SVM, random forest, and XGBoost) were
evaluated to find the optimal model for classifying layer-wise geometric
variations. The integrated multimodal strategy achieved a superior
classification performance of 94.4%, compared to 87.8% for AE only and 86.7%
for the camera only. Validation confirmed the integrated system effectively
captures both structural vibration signatures and surface morphological changes
tied to the geometric variations. While this study focuses on specific
geometries, the demonstrated capability to discriminate between features
establishes a technical foundation for future applications in characterizing
part variations like geometric inaccuracies and manufacturing-induced defects.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems face increasing susceptibility
to advanced beam-stealing attacks, posing a significant physical layer security
threat. This paper introduces a novel framework employing an advanced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent for proactive and adaptive defense against
these sophisticated attacks. A key innovation is leveraging Integrated Sensing
and Communications (ISAC) capabilities for active, intelligent threat
assessment. The DRL agent, built on a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm, dynamically controls ISAC probing actions to investigate suspicious
activities. We introduce an intensive curriculum learning strategy that
guarantees the agent experiences successful detection during training to
overcome the complex exploration challenges inherent to such a
security-critical task. Consequently, the agent learns a robust and adaptive
policy that intelligently balances security and communication performance.
Numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves a mean attacker
detection rate of 92.8% while maintaining an average user SINR of over 13 dB.

### [15] [Zak-OTFS for Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling in the Presence of Mobility & Delay Spread](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02950)
*Sandesh Rao Mattu,Nishant Mehrotra,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的快速超Nyquist信号传输方法，通过在Zak-OTFS调制中叠加信息符号并利用慢信道变化来优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交信号传输的符号数量受限于带宽和时间（BT维度），快速超Nyquist方法虽能突破限制但会导致正交性丢失。本文旨在通过新的调制方法解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Zak-OTFS调制，在延迟-多普勒（DD）域中叠加信息符号，利用慢信道变化设计预编码器，并通过互不偏置基进行符号叠加。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法在未编码时性能与Nyquist信号相当，编码后在高信噪比下表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法通过Zak-OTFS调制和互不偏置基叠加，成功实现了高效且性能优越的快速超Nyquist信号传输。

Abstract: Orthogonal signaling limits the number of information symbols transmitted in
bandwidth $B$ and time $T$ to be $BT$. This corresponds to the Nyquist
signaling and is achieved by mounting information symbols on $BT$-dimensional
basis spanning the $BT$-dimensional space spaced $\frac{1}{B}$ and
$\frac{1}{T}$ apart. Faster-than-Nyquist signaling involves transmitting more
than $BT$ informational symbols in a $BT$-dimensional space. This leads to loss
of orthogonality. This is achieved by time and/or bandwidth expansion resulting
from packing more information symbols in the same $BT$-dimensional space
(spacing less than $\frac{1}{B}$ and/or $\frac{1}{T}$). In this paper, we take
a different approach to faster-than-Nyquist signaling. We propose to
superimpose the information symbols on one another maintaining the original
spacing in the Nyquist signaling. We carry this out in the delay-Doppler (DD)
domain using Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS)
modulation. In Zak-OTFS, the channel varies slowly. Further Zak-OTFS also
allows construction of mutually unbiased bases the interference between which
appear like Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme leverages the slow variation in
the DD channel to construct a precoder that mitigates the effect of the
doubly-spread channel. Further, in the proposed scheme we mount information
symbols on two mutually unbiased bases which allows superposition of
information symbols. This simplifies receiver processing to detection in
Gaussian noise since each basis appears to the other as Gaussian noise. This
reduction makes it possible to use trellis coded modulation to enhance
bit-error performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the
faster-than-Nyquist signaling scheme achieves similar uncoded performance as
that of Nyquist signaling and with coding the performance is better than

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用可见光通信（VLC）和低成本AS7341传感器光谱特征进行室内定位的方法，通过两阶段框架（MLP训练和TabGAN生成合成数据）提升定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有射频解决方案（如Wi-Fi、RFID、UWB）存在多径衰落、干扰和覆盖范围不可控的问题，因此探索VLC作为一种替代方案，以光谱签名作为位置指纹。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）使用实际光谱测量训练多层感知机（MLP）；2）通过TabGAN生成合成样本扩充训练数据。

Result: 数据集扩充后，平均定位误差从62.9cm降至49.3cm（提升20%），仅需5%的额外数据收集成本。实验在42个参考点验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 基于GAN的数据增强能够缓解数据稀缺问题并提升模型泛化能力，证明VLC是室内定位的一种可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization underpins applications ranging from wayfinding
and emergency response to asset tracking and smart-building services.
Radio-frequency solutions (e.g. Wi-Fi, RFID, UWB) are widely adopted but remain
vulnerable to multipath fading, interference, and uncontrollable coverage
variation. We explore an orthogonal modality -- visible light communication
(VLC) -- and demonstrate that the spectral signatures captured by a low-cost
AS7341 sensor can serve as robust location fingerprints.
  We introduce a two-stage framework that (i) trains a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) on real spectral measurements and (ii) enlarges the training corpus with
synthetic samples produced by TabGAN. The augmented dataset reduces the mean
localization error from 62.9cm to 49.3cm -- a 20% improvement -- while
requiring only 5% additional data-collection effort. Experimental results
obtained on 42 reference points in a U-shaped laboratory confirm that GAN-based
augmentation mitigates data-scarcity issues and enhances generalization.

Motivation: 解决下一代无线通信系统对性能的高需求，同时提升极大规模天线阵列（ELAA）的实用性。

Method: 采用可重构透射超表面实现高效的射频到天线耦合和相位控制，开发了电磁场传播模型和距离依赖的近似模型，提出了两阶段信道估计框架。

Result: 数值实验验证了信道估计算法的高分辨率和电磁模型的准确性，MELA架构展现出接近最优的空间分辨率。

Conclusion: MELA架构为极大规模天线的实际部署提供了高效且前瞻性的解决方案。

Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) have emerged as a pivotal
technology for addressing the unprecedented performance demands of
next-generation wireless communication systems. To enhance their practicality,
we propose metasurface-enabled extremely large-scale antenna (MELA) systems --
novel transceiver architectures that employ reconfigurable transmissive
metasurfaces to facilitate efficient over-the-air RF-to-antenna coupling and
phase control. This architecture eliminates the need for bulky switch matrices
and costly phase-shifter networks typically required in conventional solutions.
Physically grounded models are developed to characterize electromagnetic field
propagation through individual transmissive unit cells, capturing the
fundamental physics of wave transformation and transmission. Additionally,
distance-dependent approximate models are introduced, exhibiting structural
properties conducive to efficient parameter estimation and signal processing.
Based on the channel model, a two stage channel estimation framework is
proposed for the scenarios comprising users in the hybrid near- and far-fields.
In the first stage, a dictionary-driven beamspace filtering technique enables
rapid angular-domain scanning. In the refinement stage, the rotational symmetry
of subarrays is exploited to design super-resolution estimators that jointly
recover angular and range parameters. An analytical expression for the
half-power beamwidth of MELA is derived, revealing its near-optimal spatial
resolution relative to conventional ELAA architectures. Numerical experiments
further validate the high-resolution of the proposed channel estimation
algorithm and the fidelity of the electromagnetic model, positioning the MELA
architecture as a highly competitive and forward-looking solution for practical
ELAA deployment.

Motivation: 无线定位技术在智能位置服务中具有潜力，但环境动态性影响了其实际应用的准确性。

Method: 采用对比自监督预训练框架CSSLoc，通过无监督学习无线电数据的相似性度量，生成场景无关的表示空间。特征编码器可直接迁移至下游定位任务。

Result: CSSLoc在典型室内场景中优于经典和最先进的基于DNN的定位方案，提升了定位的通用性。

Conclusion: CSSLoc通过对比自监督学习，将深度学习定位从特定性推向泛化性，具有显著的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Wireless localization has become a promising technology for offering
intelligent location-based services. Although its localization accuracy is
improved under specific scenarios, the short of environmental dynamic
vulnerability still hinders this approach from being fully practical
applications. In this paper, we propose CSSLoc, a novel framework on
contrastive self-supervised pre-training to learn generic representations for
accurate localization in various scenarios. Without the location information
supervision, CSSLoc attempts to learn an insightful metric on the similarity
discrimination of radio data, in such a scenario-agnostic manner that the
similar samples are closely clustered together and different samples are
separated in the representation space. Furthermore, the trained feature encoder
can be directly transferred for downstream localization tasks, and the location
predictor is trained to estimate accurate locations with the robustness of
environmental dynamics. With extensive experimental results, CSSLoc can
outperform classical and state-of-the-art DNN-based localization schemes in
typical indoor scenarios, pushing deep-learning-based localization from
specificity to generality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有雷达技术结合深度学习的材料识别方法局限于封闭集对象且需任务特定数据训练，限制了实际应用。如何利用LLM的强大推理能力直接从雷达信号推断材料组成是研究动机。

Method: 1)设计物理信号处理流程，压缩冗余雷达原始数据为紧凑中间参数；2)采用RAG策略为LLM提供领域知识，使其能解释和推理中间参数。

Result: 初步结果表明LLMaterial能有效区分多种常见材料，展现出实际应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了LLM直接从雷达信号识别材料的可行性，为开放集材料识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurately identifying the material composition of objects is a critical
capability for AI robots powered by large language models (LLMs) to perform
context-aware manipulation. Radar technologies offer a promising sensing
modality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar
technologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of
various objects. However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained
to closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data
collection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical
applicability. This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful
reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material
composition from raw radar signals? Answering this question is non-trivial due
to the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs
have no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we
introduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using
LLM to identify materials directly from radar signals. First, we introduce a
physics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar
raw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the
material's intrinsic characteristics. Second, we adopt a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) strategy to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling it to interpret and reason over the extracted intermediate parameters.
Leveraging this integration, the LLM is empowered to perform step-by-step
reasoning on the condensed radar features, achieving open-set material
recognition directly from raw radar signals. Preliminary results show that
LLMaterial can effectively distinguish among a variety of common materials,
highlighting its strong potential for real-world material identification
applications.

Method: 结合延迟嵌入技术，提出HODMD算法，直接从时域模拟数据中提取主导动态模式，无需显式系统方程。

Result: HODMD解决了DMD在空间分辨率不足时的问题，适用于各类电路，通过三个测试案例验证了效率和准确性。

Conclusion: HODMD是一种通用且高效的方法，适用于大规模电路模拟。

Abstract: Model order reduction (MOR) has long been a mainstream strategy to accelerate
large-scale transient circuit simulation. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)
represents a novel data-driven characterization method, extracting dominant
dynamical modes directly from time-domain simulation data without requiring
explicit system equations. This paper first deduces the DMD algorithm and then
proposes high order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD) incorporating delayed
embedding technique, specifically targeting computational efficiency in
large-scale circuit simulations. Compared with the DMD method, the HODMD method
overcomes the problem that the output signal cannot be reconstructed when the
spatial resolution is insufficient. The proposed HODMD algorithm is applicable
to general circuits and does not impose any constraints on the topology of the
pertinent circuit or type of the components. Three representative numerical
test cases are presented to systematically validate both the computational
efficiency and accuracy of the proposed HODMD method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义通信系统中因知识库不匹配和模型过时导致的错误，需频繁模型更新的问题。

Method: 在FedSFR中引入语义特征重建步骤，部分客户端传输紧凑特征向量而非完整模型更新，设计针对VQ-based图像语义通信的损失函数。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验证实FedSFR优于现有基线，尤其适用于资源受限场景。

Conclusion: FedSFR有效且鲁棒，适用于语义通信系统的模型更新和优化。

Abstract: Recent advancements in semantic communication have primarily focused on image
transmission, where neural network (NN)-based joint source-channel coding
(JSCC) modules play a central role. However, such systems often experience
semantic communication errors due to mismatched knowledge bases between users
and performance degradation from outdated models, necessitating regular model
updates. To address these challenges in vector quantization (VQ)-based image
semantic communication systems, we propose FedSFR, a novel federated learning
(FL) framework that incorporates semantic feature reconstruction (FR). FedSFR
introduces an FR step at the parameter server (PS) and allows a subset of
clients to transmit compact feature vectors in lieu of sending full local model
updates, thereby improving training stability and communication efficiency. To
enable effective FR learning, we design a loss function tailored for VQ-based
image semantic communication and demonstrate its validity as a surrogate for
image reconstruction error. Additionally, we provide a rigorous convergence
analysis and present a differentially private variant of FedSFR, along with
formal privacy analysis. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets
validate the superiority of FedSFR over existing baselines, especially in
capacity-constrained settings, confirming both its effectiveness and
robustness.

Result: LED刹车灯的认知反应时间显著快于白炽灯，LED设计间的差异不显著。

Conclusion: LED刹车灯设计能更快引发驾驶员的认知反应，可能有助于减少追尾事故。

Abstract: Half of all road accidents result from either lack of driver attention or
from maintaining insufficient separation between vehicles. Collision from the
rear, in particular, has been identified as the most common class of accident
in the UK, and its influencing factors have been widely studied for many years.
Rear-mounted stop lamps, illuminated when braking, are the primary mechanism to
alert following drivers to the need to reduce speed or brake. This paper
develops a novel brain response approach to measuring subject reaction to
different brake light designs. A variety of off-the-shelf brake light
assemblies are tested in a physical simulated driving environment to assess the
cognitive reaction times of 22 subjects. Eight pairs of LED-based and two pairs
of incandescent bulb-based brake light assemblies are used and
electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded. Channel Pz is utilised to extract the
P3 component evoked during the decision making process that occurs in the brain
when a participant decides to lift their foot from the accelerator and depress
the brake. EEG analysis shows that both incandescent bulb-based lights are
statistically slower to evoke cognitive responses than all tested LED-based
lights. Between the LED designs, differences are evident, but not statistically
significant, attributed to the significant amount of movement artifact in the
EEG signal.

Abstract: This work presents a new spiking neural network (SNN)-based approach for user
equipment-base station (UE-BS) association in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs).
With the introduction of UAV's in wireless networks, the system architecture
becomes heterogeneous, resulting in the need for dynamic and efficient
management to avoid congestion and sustain overall performance. The presented
framework compares two SNN-based optimization strategies. Specifically, a
top-down centralized approach with complete network visibility and a bottom-up
distributed approach for individual network nodes. The SNN is based on leak
integrate-and-fire neurons with temporal components, which can perform fast and
efficient event-driven inference. Realistic ray-tracing simulations are
conducted, which showcase that the bottom-up model attains over 90\% accuracy,
while the top-down model maintains 80-100\% accuracy. Both approaches reveal a
trade-off between individually optimal solutions and UE-BS association
feasibility, thus revealing the effectiveness of both approaches depending on
deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Increasing demand for massive device connectivity in underserved regions
drives the development of advanced low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite
communication systems. Beam-hopping LEO systems without connection
establishment provide a promising solution for achieving both demand-aware
resource allocation and low access latency. This paper investigates
beam-hopping pattern design for the grant-free random access systems to
dynamically allocate satellite resources according to traffic demands across
serving cells. We formulate a binary optimization problem that aims to maximize
the minimum successful transmission probability across cells, given limited
satellite beam generation capacity. To solve this problem, we propose novel
beam-hopping design algorithms that alternately enhance the collision avoidance
rate and decoding success probability within an alternating optimization
framework. Specifically, the algorithms employ a bisection method to optimize
illumination allocation for each cell based on demand, while using the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to optimize beam-hopping
patterns for maximizing decoding success probability. Furthermore, we enhance
the ADMM by replacing the strict binary constraint with two equivalent
continuous-valued constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed algorithms compared to other beam-hopping methods and verify
robustness in managing traffic demand imbalance.

Conclusion: 提出的CF-mMIMO主动监控系统在CSI获取和优化方法上有显著优势，适用于不同天线配置和预编码方案。

Abstract: This paper studies a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(CF-mMIMO) proactive monitoring system in which multiple multi-antenna
monitoring nodes (MNs) are assigned to either observe the transmissions from an
untrusted transmitter (UT) or to jam the reception at the untrusted receiver
(UR). We propose an effective channel state information (CSI) acquisition
scheme for the monitoring system. In our approach, the MNs leverage the pilot
signals transmitted during the uplink and downlink phases of the untrusted link
and estimate the effective channels corresponding to the UT and UR via a
minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation scheme. We derive new spectral
efficiency (SE) expressions for the untrusted link and the monitoring system.
For the latter, the SE is derived for two CSI availability cases at the central
processing unit (CPU); namely case-1: imperfect CSI knowledge at both MNs and
CPU, case-2: imperfect CSI knowledge at the MNs and no CSI knowledge at the
CPU. To improve the monitoring performance, we propose a novel joint mode
assignment and jamming power control optimization method to maximize the
monitoring success probability (MSP) based on the Bayesian optimization
framework. Numerical results show that (a) our CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring
system relying on the proposed CSI acquisition and optimization approach
significantly outperforms the considered benchmarks; (b) the MSP performance of
our CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring system is greater than 0.8, regardless of the
number of antennas at the untrusted nodes or the precoding scheme for the
untrusted transmission link.

Conclusion: 提出的DTDD CF-mMIMO ISAC系统在保留硬件简单性的同时，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: This paper studies integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with dynamic
time division duplex (DTDD) cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input
multiple-output~(mMIMO) systems. DTDD enables the CF mMIMO system to
concurrently serve both uplink~(UL) and downlink~(DL) users with spatially
separated \emph{half-duplex~(HD)} access points~(APs) using the same
time-frequency resources. Further, to facilitate ISAC, the UL APs are utilized
for both UL data and target echo reception, while the DL APs jointly transmit
the precoded DL data streams and target signal. In this context, we present
centralized and distributed generalized likelihood-ratio tests~(GLRTs) for
target detection treating UL users' signals as sensing interference. We then
quantify the optimality and complexity trade-off between distributed and
centralized GLRTs and benchmark the respective estimators with the Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for target radar-cross section~(RCS). Then, we present
a unified framework for joint UL users' data detection and RCS estimation.
Next, for communication, we derive the signal-to-noise-plus-interference~(SINR)
optimal combiner accounting for the cross-link and radar interference for UL
data processing. In DL, we use regularized zero-forcing for the users and
propose two types of precoders for the target: one ``user-centric" that
nullifies the interference caused by the target signal to the DL users and one
``target-centric" based on the dominant eigenvector of the composite channel
between the target and the APs. Finally, numerical studies corroborate with our
theoretical findings and reveal that the \emph{GLRT is robust to inter-AP
interference, and DTDD doubles the $90\%$-likely sum UL-DL SE compared to
traditional TDD-based CF-mMIMO ISAC systems}; while using HD hardware.

exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice
using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the
communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding
of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome
communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome
communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a
multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is
conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological
signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart
agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of
agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed.
These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things
enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and

open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are
discussed.

Abstract: Semantic communication is an emerging paradigm that prioritizes transmitting
task-relevant information over accurately delivering raw data bits. In this
paper, we address an unequal error protection (UEP) problem in digital semantic
communication, where bits of higher semantic importance require stronger
protection. To quantify bit-level importance, we leverage bit-flip
probabilities of semantic bits as target error protection levels, which are
jointly learned with semantic encoder and decoder. We propose two novel channel
coding frameworks aimed at minimizing the total blocklength while satisfying
UEP constraints. First, we develop a bit-level UEP framework based on
repetition coding, in which the repetition number for each bit is optimized to
precisely meet its target bit-flip probability. Second, we introduce a
block-level UEP framework utilizing modern channel codes, where semantic bits
with similar target bit-flip probabilities are grouped to exploit coding gains.
Within this framework, we propose a bit-grouping algorithm guided by finite
blocklength capacity analysis. Simulation results conducted on image
transmission tasks confirm that the proposed frameworks significantly
outperform conventional approaches, yielding substantial improvements in both
task performance and transmission efficiency.

Abstract: Transparency and explainability are two important aspects to be considered
when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications.
Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of catering this requirement.
However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of the institution that is
providing the explanation, as well as the user who is requesting it. In this
work, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve
a counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the
institution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual
explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect,
information-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of
private counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that
keeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the
institution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the
amount of information leaked about the institution database to the user,
compared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability
of all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the
user retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of
their features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their
feature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we
propose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically,
but ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and
I-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their
attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we
present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the
database leakage of the proposed schemes.

Abstract: Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for
Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their
integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted
to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale
deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited
generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework
based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage
localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to
have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source
and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling
effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about
dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained
CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed
MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different
composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess
domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a
substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.
Hence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and
statistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.

Conclusion: STSMamba方法有效解决了MODIS数据分类中的关键问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Although MODIS time series data are critical for supporting dynamic,
large-scale land cover land use classification, it is a challenging task to
capture the subtle class signature information due to key MODIS difficulties,
e.g., high temporal dimensionality, mixed pixels, and spatial-temporal-spectral
coupling effect. This paper presents a novel spatial-temporal-spectral Mamba
(STSMamba) with deformable token sequence for enhanced MODIS time series
classification, with the following key contributions. First, to disentangle
temporal-spectral feature coupling, a temporal grouped stem (TGS) module is
designed for initial feature learning. Second, to improve Mamba modeling
efficiency and accuracy, a sparse, deformable Mamba sequencing (SDMS) approach
is designed, which can reduce the potential information redundancy in Mamba
sequence and improve the adaptability and learnability of the Mamba sequencing.
Third, based on SDMS, to improve feature learning, a novel
spatial-temporal-spectral Mamba architecture is designed, leading to three
modules, i.e., a sparse deformable spatial Mamba module (SDSpaM), a sparse
deformable spectral Mamba module (SDSpeM), and a sparse deformable temporal
Mamba module (SDTM) to explicitly learn key information sources in MODIS. The
proposed approach is tested on MODIS time series data in comparison with many
state-of-the-art approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed
approach can achieve higher classification accuracy with reduced computational
complexity.

Abstract: The rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has enabled real-time
monitoring and intervention for mental health conditions using passively sensed
smartphone data. Building on these capabilities, Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs) seek to deliver personalized support at opportune
moments, adapting to users' evolving contexts and needs. Although prior
research has examined how context affects user responses to generic
notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored
its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions.
Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when
users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to
understanding receptivity, i.e., users' willingness and ability to engage with
and act upon the intervention.
  In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components:
acceptance(acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to
act given situational constraints). We conducted a two-week in-the-wild study
with 70 students using a custom Android app, LogMe, which collected passive
sensor data and active context reports to prompt mental health interventions.
The adaptive intervention module was built using Thompson Sampling, a
reinforcement learning algorithm. We address four research questions relating
smartphone features and self-reported contexts to acceptance and feasibility,
and examine whether an adaptive reinforcement learning approach can optimize
intervention delivery by maximizing a combined receptivity reward. Our results
show that several types of passively sensed data significantly influenced user
receptivity to interventions. Our findings contribute insights into the design
of context-aware, adaptive interventions that are not only timely but also
actionable in real-world settings.
