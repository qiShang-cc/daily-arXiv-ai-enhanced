One significant change is that agents,\ninstead of traditional machines or humans, will be the primary participants in\nthe future production process, which consequently requires a novel AI-native\ncommunication system tailored for agent communications. Integrating the ability\nof large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented semantic communication is a\npotential approach.

In\nthis paper, we innovatively propose a task-oriented agent communication system.\nSpecifically, we leverage the original LLM to learn a specialized machine\nlanguage represented by token embeddings. Simultaneously, a multi-modal LLM is\ntrained to comprehend the application task and to extract essential implicit\ninformation from multi-modal inputs, subsequently expressing it using machine\nlanguage tokens. This representation is significantly more efficient for\ntransmission over the air interface.

This paper tackles this optimization when the\ncommunication is assisted by a RIS whose phase shifts are adjusted on the basis\nof the statistics of the channels. For a setting representative of a\nmacrocellular deployment, the benefits of optimizing the PDPR are seen to be\nsignificant over a broad range of operating conditions. These benefits,\ndemonstrated through the ergodic minimum mean squared error, for which a\nclosed-form solution is derived, become more pronounced as the number of RIS\nelements and/or the channel coherence grow large."}

Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and\nsupport clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent\nfunctional decline. This study has been submitted to the \\textit{Second\nMultimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The\nproposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input\nsignal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer\nalongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nrespiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover,\nexperiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly\noptimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger\ncounterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both\nshort-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby\nenhancing the model's representational capacity."}
