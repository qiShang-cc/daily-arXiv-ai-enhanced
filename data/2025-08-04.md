TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个近似闭式表达式，用于估计宽带系统中受激拉曼散射和光纤损耗的综合影响，并通过数值验证了其准确性，还推导了逆表达式以通过预加重实现目标OSNR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宽带系统中的受激拉曼散射(ISRS)和通道相关损耗会导致非均匀衰减，需通过数值方法准确估计。本文旨在提出一种闭式表达式以简化这一过程。

Method: 提出一个近似闭式表达式，用于计算通道功率分布，并通过数值解验证其准确性。还推导了一个逆表达式，用于通过预加重调整发射功率以实现目标OSNR。

Result: 验证表明，该表达式在单跨度和多跨度光纤链路中均具有高准确性，并能通过预加重实现目标OSNR分布。

Conclusion: 该闭式表达式提供了一种高效且准确的方法，用于估计宽带系统中的功率分布和优化OSNR性能。

Abstract: Wideband systems experience significant inter-channel stimulated Raman
scattering (ISRS) and channel-dependent losses. Due to the non-uniform
attenuation profile, the combined effects of ISRS and fiber loss can only be
accurately estimated using numerical methods. In this work, we present an
approximate closed-form expression for the channels' power profile accounting
for these combined effects. We validate the proposed expression against
numerical solutions in the case of CLU transmission, showing high accuracy for
both single-span and multi-span fiber-optic links. Additionally, we derive an
inverse expression, formulated as a function of the output power, which can be
utilized to target a desired optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) profile
through pre-emphasis of the launched channel powers.

*Yunfei Liu,Mingxuan Liu,Wupeng Xie,Xinzhu Liu,Wenxue Liu,Yangang Sun,Xin Qiu,Cui Yuan,Jinhai Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为RIS-MAE的自监督学习框架，用于解决自动调制分类（AMC）中的两个主要问题：依赖时频图像导致的特征丢失和对大量标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMC在智能无线通信系统中至关重要，但现有方法依赖时频图像和有监督学习，导致特征丢失和数据需求大，难以适应实际环境。

Method: 提出了RIS-MAE框架，利用掩码自编码器从无标签的原始IQ序列中学习信号特征，通过随机掩码和重建捕捉关键时域特征。

Result: 在四个数据集上测试，RIS-MAE在少样本和跨域任务中优于现有方法，仅需少量微调样本即可在新数据集上实现高分类精度。

Conclusion: RIS-MAE具有优异的泛化能力和实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a basic technology in
intelligent wireless communication systems. It is important for tasks such as
spectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent
years, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC. However,
mainstream methods still face two key problems. First, they often use
time-frequency images instead of raw signals. This causes loss of key
modulation features and reduces adaptability to different communication
conditions. Second, most methods rely on supervised learning. This needs a
large amount of labeled data, which is hard to get in real-world environments.
To solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called
RIS-MAE. RIS-MAE uses masked autoencoders to learn signal features from
unlabeled data. It takes raw IQ sequences as input. By applying random masking
and reconstruction, it captures important time-domain features such as
amplitude, phase, etc. This helps the model learn useful and transferable
representations. RIS-MAE is tested on four datasets. The results show that it
performs better than existing methods in few-shot and cross-domain tasks.
Notably, it achieves high classification accuracy on previously unseen datasets
with only a small number of fine-tuning samples, confirming its generalization
ability and potential for real-world deployment.

### [3] [Model-Driven Deep Learning Enhanced Joint Beamforming and Mode Switching for RDARS-Aided MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00326)
*Chengwang Ji,Kehui Li,Haiquan Lu,Qiaoyan Peng,Jintao Wang,Shaodan Ma*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于RDARS架构的6G无线网络优化方法，通过联合优化基站和RDARS的波束成形矩阵以及RDARS的模式切换矩阵，显著提升了系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是通过动态工作模式配置的RDARS架构，为6G无线网络带来额外选择增益，超越现有RIS辅助系统和DAS的能力。

Method: 方法是通过结合MM和WMMSE技术的PWM算法，以及模型驱动深度学习，优化波束成形和模式切换矩阵。

Result: 仿真结果显示，PWM-BFNet能将迭代次数减半，并在高发射功率和大规模RDARS传输元素场景下分别实现26.53%和103.2%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，RDARS架构及其优化方法在6G网络中具有显著优势，提供了更高的系统性能和更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: Reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is a
promising architecture for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In
particular, the dynamic working mode configuration for the RDARS-aided system
brings an extra selection gain compared to the existing reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-aided system and distributed antenna system (DAS). In
this paper, we consider the RDARS-aided downlink multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) system and aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) by jointly
optimizing the beamforming matrices at the based station (BS) and RDARS, as
well as mode switching matrix at RDARS. The optimization problem is challenging
to be solved due to the non-convex objective function and mixed integer binary
constraint. To this end, a penalty term-based weight minimum mean square error
(PWM) algorithm is proposed by integrating the majorization-minimization (MM)
and weight minimum mean square error (WMMSE) methods. To further escape the
local optimum point in the PWM algorithm, a model-driven DL method is
integrated into this algorithm, where the key variables related to the
convergence of PWM algorithm are trained to accelerate the convergence speed
and improve the system performance. Simulation results are provided to show
that the PWM-based beamforming network (PWM-BFNet) can reduce the number of
iterations by half and achieve performance improvements of 26.53% and 103.2% at
the scenarios of high total transmit power and a large number of RDARS transmit
elements (TEs), respectively.

Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is intrinsically amalgamated with
simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) to enhance energy efficiency (EE) of the finite block length
(FBL) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink. An alternating
optimization-based algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the transmit
beamforming matrices, STAR-RIS configurations, and rate-splitting parameters.
STAR-RIS attains 360-degree full-plane coverage, while RSMA provides a
prominent gain by efficiently managing interference. Numerical results reveal a
strong synergy between RSMA and STAR-RIS, demonstreating significant EE gains
over reflective RIS and spatial division multiple access (SDMA).

### [5] [When Vision-Language Model (VLM) Meets Beam Prediction: A Multimodal Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00456)
*Ji Wang,Bin Tang,Jian Xiao,Qimei Cui,Xingwang Li,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的多模态波束预测框架，通过对比学习增强跨模态一致性，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对复杂动态环境下毫米波波束预测的挑战，传统依赖实时信道状态信息（CSI）的方法成本高且精度不足，VLM的跨模态表示能力提供了新思路。

Method: 采用对比预训练策略整合图像和LiDAR特征，利用位置信息作为文本提示引入语言模态，实现跨模态一致性。

Result: 在DeepSense-6G数据集上，VLM框架的DBA-Score达到0.9016，比现有方法平均提升了1.46%。

Conclusion: VLM驱动的多模态框架通过语义增强和跨模态一致性，显著改进了复杂环境下的波束预测性能。

Abstract: As the real propagation environment becomes in creasingly complex and
dynamic, millimeter wave beam prediction faces huge challenges. However, the
powerful cross modal representation capability of vision-language model (VLM)
provides a promising approach. The traditional methods that rely on real-time
channel state information (CSI) are computationally expensive and often fail to
maintain accuracy in such environments. In this paper, we present a VLM-driven
contrastive learning based multimodal beam prediction framework that integrates
multimodal data via modality-specific encoders. To enforce cross-modal
consistency, we adopt a contrastive pretraining strategy to align image and
LiDAR features in the latent space. We use location information as text prompts
and connect it to the text encoder to introduce language modality, which
further improves cross-modal consistency. Experiments on the DeepSense-6G
dataset show that our VLM backbone provides additional semantic grounding.
Compared with existing methods, the overall distance-based accuracy score
(DBA-Score) of 0.9016, corresponding to 1.46% average improvement.

### [6] [Feasibility of Extracting Skin Nerve Activity from Electrocardiogram Recorded at A Low Sampling Frequency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00494)
*Youngsun Kong,Farnoush Baghestani,I-Ping Chen,Ki Chon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SKNA可从低采样频率的ECG信号中提取，与传统高采样率效果相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究低采样频率下SKNA提取的可行性，以解决穿戴设备采样率限制问题。

Method: 采集16名参与者的ECG信号，重采样为0.5、1和4 kHz，通过统计分析比较SKNA指标。

Result: 结果表明，不同采样频率下SKNA指标无显著差异。

Conclusion: 常规低采样率ECG设备可用于可靠收集SKNA，前提是肌肉伪影较少。

Abstract: Skin nerve activity (SKNA) derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has
been a promising non-invasive surrogate for accurate and effective assessment
of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Typically, SKNA extraction requires a
higher sampling frequency than the typical ECG recording requirement (> 2 kHz)
because analysis tools extract SKNA from the 0.5-1 kHz frequency band. However,
ECG recording systems commonly provide a sampling frequency of 1 kHz or lower,
particularly for wearable devices. Our recent power spectral analysis exhibited
that 150-500 Hz frequency bands are dominant during sympathetic stimulation.
Therefore, we hypothesize that SKNA can be extracted from ECG sampled at a
lower sampling frequency. We collected ECG signals from 16 participants during
SNS stimulation and resampled the signals at 0.5, 1, and 4 kHz. Our statistical
analyses of significance, classification performance, and reliability indicate
no significant difference between SKNA indices derived from ECG signals sampled
at 0.5, 1, and 4 kHz. Our findings indicate that conventional ECG devices,
which are limited to low sampling rates due to resource constraints or outdated
guidelines, can be used to reliably collect SKNA if muscle artifact
contamination is minimal.

### [7] [Subband Architecture Aided Selective Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00603)
*Hong-Cheng Liang,Man-Wai Mak,Kong Aik Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于延迟无子带结构的新选择性固定滤波器方案，以提高噪声抑制效果和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统选择性固定滤波器方法仅能处理有限类型噪声，且对非均匀功率谱密度噪声性能下降。

Method: 离线训练阶段预训练不同频率范围的子带控制滤波器；在线阶段通过FFT滤波器组分解噪声并匹配子带滤波器，再堆叠权重为全带滤波器。

Result: 实验证明该方案收敛快、降噪效果好且在处理复杂噪声环境时鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: 该方案显著提升了对复杂噪声的抑制能力。

Abstract: The feedforward selective fixed-filter method selects the most suitable
pre-trained control filter based on the spectral features of the detected
reference signal, effectively avoiding slow convergence in conventional
adaptive algorithms. However, it can only handle limited types of noises, and
the performance degrades when the input noise exhibits non-uniform power
spectral density. To address these limitations, this paper devises a novel
selective fixed-filter scheme based on a delayless subband structure. In the
off-line training stage, subband control filters are pre-trained for different
frequency ranges and stored in a dedicated sub-filter database. During the
on-line control stage, the incoming noise is decomposed using a polyphase FFT
filter bank, and a frequency-band-matching mechanism assigns each subband
signal the most appropriate control filter. Subsequently, a weight stacking
technique is employed to combine all subband weights into a fullband filter,
enabling real-time noise suppression. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme provides fast convergence, effective noise reduction, and
strong robustness in handling more complicated noisy environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着通信需求的增长，HTS系统作为6G关键技术，亟需优化资源分配和干扰消除，以提升性能并服务偏远地区。

Method: 论文首先总结HTS系统的硬件基础，随后综述灵活的无线资源分配方法和多波束预编码技术，最后探讨相关挑战。

Result: 研究提出了HTS系统在资源分配和干扰消除方面的多种优化方案，并指出未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 优化HTS系统的资源分配和预编码技术将提升性能，助力6G通信发展，尤其是对偏远地区的覆盖。

Abstract: With its wide coverage and uninterrupted service, satellite communication is
a critical technology for next-generation 6G communications. High throughput
satellite (HTS) systems, utilizing multipoint beam and frequency multiplexing
techniques, enable satellite communication capacity of up to Tbps to meet the
growing traffic demand. Therefore, it is imperative to review
the-state-of-the-art of multibeam HTS systems and identify their associated
challenges and perspectives. Firstly, we summarize the multibeam HTS hardware
foundations, including ground station systems, on-board payloads, and user
terminals. Subsequently, we review the flexible on-board radio resource
allocation approaches of bandwidth, power, time slot, and joint allocation
schemes of HTS systems to optimize resource utilization and cater to
non-uniform service demand. Additionally, we survey multibeam precoding methods
for the HTS system to achieve full-frequency reuse and interference
cancellation, which are classified according to different deployments such as
single gateway precoding, multiple gateway precoding, on-board precoding, and
hybrid on-board/on-ground precoding. Finally, we disscuss the challenges
related to Q/V band link outage, time and frequency synchronization of
gateways, the accuracy of channel state information (CSI), payload light-weight
development, and the application of deep learning (DL). Research on these
topics will contribute to enhancing the performance of HTS systems and finally
delivering high-speed data to areas underserved by terrestrial networks.

### [9] [Beamformed 360° Sound Maps: U-Net-Driven Acoustic Source Segmentation and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00307)
*Belman Jahir Rodriguez,Sergio F. Chevtchenko,Marcelo Herrera Martinez,Yeshwant Bethy,Saeed Afshar*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于U-net模型的360度声源定位方法，将声源定位任务视为球形语义分割问题，通过分段波束成形音频图来识别声源区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声源定位方法通常通过回归离散的到达角度（DoA）进行定位，但这种方法在高密度空间音频理解中效果有限。本文旨在通过语义分割实现更精确的定位。

Method: 使用延迟求和（DAS）波束成形技术生成音频图，并将其作为U-net的输入。通过Tversky损失函数解决类别不平衡问题，最终通过计算激活区域的质心实现DoA估计。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同环境下具有泛化能力，并提高了角度定位精度。

Conclusion: U-net模型为密集空间音频理解提供了新的范式，优于传统的声源定位方法。

Abstract: We introduce a U-net model for 360{\deg} acoustic source localization
formulated as a spherical semantic segmentation task. Rather than regressing
discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio
maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using
delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate
signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A
modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps,
learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class
imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed
energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to
different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The
segmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated
regions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world
open-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360{\deg} video
and flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show
that U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular
precision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond
traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列数据中特征识别的挑战，尤其是在音频识别任务中。

Method: 采用连续小波变换提取频谱特征，并通过小波相干分析比较录音频谱与合成音乐。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能高效准确地识别录音音乐。

Conclusion: 小波相干模型在多个领域（如EEG信号分析和金融时间序列预测）中表现优异，优于其他时频分解方法。

Abstract: This work presents a wavelet-based approach to time-frequency fingerprinting
for time series feature extraction, with a focus on audio identification from
live recordings of traditional Irish tunes. The challenges of identifying
features in time-series data are addressed by employing a continuous wavelet
transform to extract spectral features and wavelet coherence analysis is used
to compare recorded audio spectrograms to synthetically generated tunes. The
synthetic tunes are derived from ABC notation, which is a common symbolic
representation for Irish music. Experimental results demonstrate that the
wavelet-based method can accurately and efficiently identify recorded tunes.
This research study also details the performance of the wavelet coherence
model, highlighting its strengths over other methods of time-frequency
decomposition. Additionally, we discuss and deploy the model on several
applications beyond music, including in EEG signal analysis and financial time
series forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖领域特定或未经训练的先验，而FMPlug通过简单但强大的洞见，利用基础模型的真正潜力。

Method: 引入时间自适应预热策略和尖锐高斯性正则化，增强基础流匹配先验。

Result: 在图像超分辨率和高斯去模糊任务中显著优于现有使用基础流匹配先验的方法。

Conclusion: FMPlug通过创新的策略和正则化，展示了在不适定逆问题中的优越性能。

Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation
flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike
traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug
smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between
observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By
introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity
regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation
models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors
by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

*Ecem Bozkurt,Antonio Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段框架，利用几何信息改进基础模型在标签噪声下的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在标签噪声下微调时，传统方法依赖局部几何信息，希望通过引入几何信息改进性能。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：可靠性估计和加权推断，使用非负核（NNK）构建局部邻域，并提出基于可靠性估计的方法。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和DermaMNIST上验证，新方法在不同噪声条件下优于标准K-NN和自适应邻域基线。

Conclusion: 通过引入几何信息，显著提升了模型在标签噪声下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) pretrained on large datasets have become fundamental
for various downstream machine learning tasks, in particular in scenarios where
obtaining perfectly labeled data is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we
assume an FM has to be fine-tuned with noisy data and present a two-stage
framework to ensure robust classification in the presence of label noise
without model retraining. Recent work has shown that simple k-nearest neighbor
(kNN) approaches using an embedding derived from an FM can achieve good
performance even in the presence of severe label noise. Our work is motivated
by the fact that these methods make use of local geometry. In this paper,
following a similar two-stage procedure, reliability estimation followed by
reliability-weighted inference, we show that improved performance can be
achieved by introducing geometry information. For a given instance, our
proposed inference uses a local neighborhood of training data, obtained using
the non-negative kernel (NNK) neighborhood construction. We propose several
methods for reliability estimation that can rely less on distance and local
neighborhood as the label noise increases. Our evaluation on CIFAR-10 and
DermaMNIST shows that our methods improve robustness across various noise
conditions, surpassing standard K-NN approaches and recent
adaptive-neighborhood baselines.

Conclusion: 无人机辅助的MEC系统和DPPOIL算法有效提升了智能设备的计算性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technique to improve the
computational capacity of smart devices (SDs) in Internet of Things (IoT).
However, the performance of MEC is restricted due to its fixed location and
limited service scope. Hence, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-assisted MEC system, where multiple UAVs are dispatched and each UAV can
simultaneously provide computing service for multiple SDs. To improve the
performance of system, we formulated a UAV-based trajectory control and
resource allocation multi-objective optimization problem (TCRAMOP) to
simultaneously maximize the offloading number of UAVs and minimize total
offloading delay and total energy consumption of UAVs by optimizing the flight
paths of UAVs as well as the computing resource allocated to served SDs. Then,
consider that the solution of TCRAMOP requires continuous decision-making and
the system is dynamic, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm, namely, distributed proximal policy optimization with imitation
learning (DPPOIL). This algorithm incorporates the generative adversarial
imitation learning technique to improve the policy performance. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DPPOIL and prove that the
learned strategy of DPPOIL is better compared with other baseline methods.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了网络的韧性和任务执行能力，适用于多阶段操作。

Abstract: Heterogeneous marine-aerial swarm networks encounter substantial difficulties
due to targeted communication disruptions and structural weaknesses in
adversarial environments. This paper proposes a two-step framework to
strengthen the network's resilience. Specifically, our framework combines the
node prioritization based on criticality with multi-objective topology
optimization. First, we design a three-layer architecture to represent
structural, communication, and task dependencies of the swarm networks. Then,
we introduce the SurBi-Ranking method, which utilizes graph convolutional
networks, to dynamically evaluate and rank the criticality of nodes and edges
in real time. Next, we apply the NSGA-III algorithm to optimize the network
topology, aiming to balance communication efficiency, global connectivity, and
mission success rate. Experiments demonstrate that compared to traditional
methods like K-Shell, our SurBi-Ranking method identifies critical nodes and
edges with greater accuracy, as deliberate attacks on these components cause
more significant connectivity degradation. Furthermore, our optimization
approach, when prioritizing SurBi-Ranked critical components under attack,
reduces the natural connectivity degradation by around 30%, achieves higher
mission success rates, and incurs lower communication reconfiguration costs,
ensuring sustained connectivity and mission effectiveness across multi-phase
operations.

amplifying the reflected signals so as to overcome significant reflection path
loss in NLoS communication and sensing. In particular, we derive the sensing
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target response matrix.
Accordingly, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and the
reflective beamforming at the active IRS to minimize the sensing CRB, subject
to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements at the CUs,
the transmit power budgets at the BS and active IRS, as well as the power
amplification gain constraints at the active IRS. The CRB minimization problem
is highly non-convex and thus difficult to solve in general. To address this
challenge, we first focus on two specified conditions by considering the
sensing-only scenario via ignoring the SINR constraints for communications, for
which the closed-form optimal transmit beamforming is derived. Then, we propose
two efficient alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms to obtain
high-quality solutions for the general ISAC scenarios. Next, we analyze the
inherent relationship between the power scaling at the BS and the amplification
scaling at the active IRS. It is shown that the active IRS always amplifies the
signal using the maximum amplification gain under practical system settings.
Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed AO-based algorithms and the benefits of active IRS-enabled ISAC
compared to its passive IRSs counterparts.

Abstract: Rydberg atomic (RA) receivers represent a revolutionary quantum technology
for wireless communications, offering unprecedented sensitivity beyond
conventional radio frequency (RF) antennas. However, these receivers detect
only signal amplitude, losing critical phase information. While reference
signals generated by a local oscillator (LO) can assist in phase recovery,
existing modulation schemes designed for conventional systems perform poorly
with this quantum detection mechanism. This paper introduces a breakthrough
LO-aware adaptive modulation (LOAM) scheme specifically developed for RA
receivers that dynamically adapts to complex fading channel coefficients. LOAM
maximizes the minimum amplitude difference between constellation points,
ensuring optimal detection performance. The innovation employs an adaptive
co-linear constellation architecture aligned with the combined phase of
reference signal and channel coefficient. For strong reference signals, LOAM
generates symmetric constellation points centered at origin; for weak signals,
it adopts non-symmetric distributions. The paper mathematically derives the
threshold governing these operational regimes. Simulation results reveal the
transformative impact of LOAM, demonstrating performance gains exceeding 45 dB
over conventional modulation schemes, including quadrature amplitude modulation
(QAM), phase-shift keying (PSK), and pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM).

Abstract: Accurate and efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is crucial
for unlocking the substantial spectral efficiency gains of extremely
large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems in future 6G networks. However, the
combination of near-field spherical wave propagation and frequency-dependent
beam split effects in wideband scenarios poses significant challenges for CSI
representation and compression. This paper proposes WideNLNet-CA, a
rate-adaptive deep learning framework designed to enable efficient CSI feedback
in wideband near-field XL-MIMO systems. WideNLNet-CA introduces a lightweight
encoder-decoder architecture with multi-stage downsampling and upsampling,
incorporating computationally efficient residual blocks to capture complex
multi-scale channel features with reduced overhead. A novel compression ratio
adaptive module with feature importance estimation is introduced to dynamically
modulate feature selection based on target compression ratios, enabling
flexible adaptation across a wide range of feedback rates using a single model.
Evaluation results demonstrate that WideNLNet-CA consistently outperforms
existing compressive sensing and deep learning-based works across various
compression ratios and bandwidths, while maintaining fast inference and low
model storage requirements.
