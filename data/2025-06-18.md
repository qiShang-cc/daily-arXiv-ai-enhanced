### [1] [Dynamically Tunable Helical Antenna](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14065)
*Ethan Chien,Jan Steckel*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了一种针对高速无人机FPV系统的实时可调螺旋天线阵列，显著降低了多普勒和多径效应引起的误包率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速无人机在复杂环境中飞行时，多普勒频移和多径效应会导致通信链路误包率大幅上升，需要新型解决方案。

Method: 结合Maxwell方程的全波仿真(Ansys HFSS)与盲测场试验，提出了一种可实时调整螺距和直径的螺旋天线阵列。

Result: 相比固定天线，自适应天线阵列在无人机速度超过150 mph时误包率降低了20-30%，且VSWR接近1，RSSI波动减少一半。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，可调螺旋天线能有效应对高速无人机的通信挑战，为无人机天线阵列设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial FPV systems demand ultra-low latency, high-reliability communication links. At high speeds and in cluttered environments, Doppler shifts and rapid multipath changes can dramatically raise packet error rates. This paper investigates these phenomena in the context of ExpressLRS (ELRS) long-range FPV control links and demonstrates a novel solution: real-time geometry tuning of a circularly polarized helical antenna array. This study integrates Maxwell-equation-based full-wave simulations (via Ansys HFSS) with controlled, blind field trials to validate performance. A new analysis framework incorporates Doppler-induced frequency offset into the antenna's radiation pattern and the system's error model. Compared to a conventional fixed antenna, the adaptive helical array shows a 20-30% PER reduction when drones exceed 150 mph. The adaptive system automatically adjusts coil pitch and diameter to retune the antenna as flight parameters (velocity, attitude) change. Measured VSWR stays near unity, preventing transmitter reflection spikes. RSSI variation is reduced by half, indicating stronger link stability in urban multi-path. A regression analysis confirms that the reduction in PER due to tuning is highly statistically significant. Calibration data and error analyses are provided to validate our methodology. These findings advance the understanding of high-mobility UAV communication channels and demonstrate that reconfigurable hardware-here, mechanically tunable helices-can effectively counter Doppler and multi-path impairments. The findings inform new design principles for UAV antenna arrays and suggest a path toward AI-integrated adaptive RF systems for drone swarms and racing platforms.

Abstract: Underwater target tracking technology plays a pivotal role in marine resource exploration, environmental monitoring, and national defense security. Given that acoustic waves represent an effective medium for long-distance transmission in aquatic environments, underwater acoustic target tracking has become a prominent research area of underwater communications and networking. Existing literature reviews often offer a narrow perspective or inadequately address the paradigm shifts driven by emerging technologies like deep learning and reinforcement learning. To address these gaps, this work presents a systematic survey of this field and introduces an innovative multidimensional taxonomy framework based on target scale, sensor perception modes, and sensor collaboration patterns. Within this framework, we comprehensively survey the literature (more than 180 publications) over the period 2016-2025, spanning from the theoretical foundations to diverse algorithmic approaches in underwater acoustic target tracking. Particularly, we emphasize the transformative potential and recent advancements of machine learning techniques, including deep learning and reinforcement learning, in enhancing the performance and adaptability of underwater tracking systems. Finally, this survey concludes by identifying key challenges in the field and proposing future avenues based on emerging technologies such as federated learning, blockchain, embodied intelligence, and large models.

Result: 理论分析了混合近远场信道对检测性能的影响，仿真结果表明该算法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了混合近远场活动检测问题，并在性能和计算效率上表现出色。

Abstract: A great amount of endeavor has recently been devoted to activity detection for massive machine-type communications in cell-free massive MIMO. However, in practice, as the number of antennas at the access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this challenge, this paper considers a hybrid near-far field activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO, and establishes a covariance-based formulation, which facilitates the development of a distributed algorithm to alleviate the computational burden at the central processing unit (CPU). Specifically, each AP performs local activity detection for the devices and then transmits the detection result to the CPU for further processing. In particular, a novel coordinate descent algorithm based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury update with Taylor expansion is proposed to handle the local detection problem at each AP. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how the hybrid near-far field channels affect the detection performance. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing approaches.

Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that can implement a phase rotation continuously over the whole surface rather than via a finite number of discrete elements. Such an RIS can be considered a design for future systems where advances in metamaterials make such an implementation feasible or as the limiting case where the number of elements in a traditional RIS increases in a given area. We derive the optimal RIS design for the single-user (SU) scenario assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) from the RIS to the base station (BS) and correlated Rayleigh fading for the other links. We also derive the associated optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its mean, a bound on the mean spectral efficiency (SE), an approximation to the SNR outage probability and an approximation to the coefficient of variation for the investigation of channel hardening.

### [6] [Widely Linear Augmented Extreme Learning Machine Based Impairments Compensation for Satellite Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14557)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星通信的动态性和固有损伤带来挑战，需要更有效的信号恢复方法。

Method: 结合CELMAH架构与WLP，提出CELM-WLLS用于后失真处理。

Result: CELM-WLLS在BER性能上优于传统方法0.8 dB，计算复杂度降低三分之二。

Conclusion: CELM-WLLS是一种高效且鲁棒的卫星通信解决方案。

Abstract: Satellite communications are crucial for the evolution beyond fifth-generation networks. However, the dynamic nature of satellite channels and their inherent impairments present significant challenges. In this paper, a novel post-compensation scheme that combines the complex-valued extreme learning machine with augmented hidden layer (CELMAH) architecture and widely linear processing (WLP) is developed to address these issues by exploiting signal impropriety in satellite communications. Although CELMAH shares structural similarities with WLP, it employs a different core algorithm and does not fully exploit the signal impropriety. By incorporating WLP principles, we derive a tailored formulation suited to the network structure and propose the CELM augmented by widely linear least squares (CELM-WLLS) for post-distortion. The proposed approach offers enhanced communication robustness and is highly effective for satellite communication scenarios characterized by dynamic channel conditions and non-linear impairments. CELM-WLLS is designed to improve signal recovery performance and outperform traditional methods such as least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). Compared to CELMAH, CELM-WLLS demonstrates approximately 0.8 dB gain in BER performance, and also achieves a two-thirds reduction in computational complexity, making it a more efficient solution.

Conclusion: 相位截断失真虽改变波形但不可感知，可用于音频机器学习的数据增强，提升模型表现。

Abstract: Phase distortion refers to the alteration of the phase relationships between frequencies in a signal, which can be perceptible. In this paper, we discuss a special case of phase distortion known as phase-intercept distortion, which is created by a frequency-independent phase shift. We hypothesize that, though this form of distortion changes a signal's waveform significantly, the distortion is imperceptible. Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the imperceptibility of phase-intercept distortion can be useful for machine learning, specifically for data augmentation. We conducted multiple experiments using phase-intercept distortion as a novel approach to data augmentation, and obtained improved results for audio machine learning tasks.

Overall, MA-IRS integration emerges as a compelling approach toward next-generation reconfigurable wireless systems.

### [9] [A stochastic noise model based excess noise factor expressions for staircase avalanche photodiodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14722)
*Ankitha E Bangera*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了多层渐变带隙雪崩光电二极管（APD）的广义过量噪声因子表达式，适用于所有工作偏压，并简化了阶梯式APD的模型，纠正了先前基于Friis噪声因子公式的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多级阶梯雪崩光电二极管（APD）的确定性放大特性使其成为光电倍增管的固态类似物，但阶梯式碰撞电离的不规则性随着级数增加而加剧，成为内部噪声的主要来源。现有的噪声模型基于Friis噪声因子公式，错误地将功率增益视为增益，因此需要更准确的模型。

Method: 作者提出了一种广义过量噪声因子表达式，基于层间电离概率，适用于所有工作偏压（亚阈值、阶梯和隧穿击穿区），并进一步推导了阶梯式APD的简化表达式。

Result: 推导的表达式与Bangera对Friis噪声因子公式的修正一致，验证了模型的正确性。

Conclusion: 新模型为多层渐变带隙APD提供了更准确的噪声描述，特别适用于阶梯式APD，纠正了先前模型的错误。

Abstract: Multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are the solid-state analogue of photomultiplier tubes, owing to their deterministic amplification with twofold stepwise gain via impact ionization. Yet, the stepwise impact ionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major source of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We further derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these expressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for cascade networks.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多用户PASS的信道容量区域，证明了其优于传统固定天线系统，并分析了单点和多点天线激活下的容量和速率区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PASS的信道容量区域，以证明其比传统固定天线系统更具优势，尤其是在多用户通信场景中。

Method: 通过分析和优化天线激活位置，推导单点和多点情况下的容量区域及TDMA和FDMA的速率区域，并利用上行-下行对偶框架扩展到下行PASS。

Result: PASS的容量区域显著大于传统系统，且在多点情况下，TDMA和FDMA能够接近信道容量极限。

Conclusion: PASS在多用户通信中表现出优越性能，其容量和速率区域的分析为实际系统设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Unlike conventional systems using a fixed-location antenna, the channel capacity of the pinching-antenna system (PASS) is determined by the activated positions of pinching antennas. This article characterizes the capacity region of multiuser PASS, where a single pinched waveguide is deployed to enable both uplink and downlink communications. The capacity region of the uplink channel is first characterized. \romannumeral1) For the single-pinch case, closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal antenna activation position, along with the corresponding capacity region and the achievable data rate regions under time-division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA). It is proven that the capacity region of PASS encompasses that of conventional fixed-antenna systems, and that the FDMA rate region contains the TDMA rate region. \romannumeral2) For the multiple-pinch case, inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are derived using an element-wise alternating antenna position optimization technique and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, respectively. The achievable FDMA rate region is also derived using the same optimization framework, while the TDMA rate region is obtained through an antenna position refinement approach. The analysis is then extended to the downlink PASS using the uplink-downlink duality framework. It is proven that the relationships among the downlink capacity and rate regions are consistent with those in the uplink case. Numerical results demonstrate that: \romannumeral1) the derived bounds closely approximate the exact capacity region, \romannumeral2) PASS yields a significantly enlarged capacity region compared to conventional fixed-antenna systems, and \romannumeral3) in the multiple-pinch case, TDMA and FDMA are capable of approaching the channel capacity limit.

Conclusion: 结论强调了协作波束成型设计对系统性能的重要性，以及优化算法在不同系统配置中的显著增益。

Abstract: We consider fronthaul-limited generalized zeroforcing-based cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems with multiple-antenna users and multipleantenna access points (APs) relying on both cooperative beamforming (CB) and user-centric (UC) clustering. The proposed framework is very general and can be degenerated into different special cases, such as pure CB/pure UC clustering, or fully centralized CB/fully distributed beamforming. We comprehensively analyze the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the system wherein the users use the minimum mean-squared errorbased successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) scheme to detect the desired signals. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the user association and power control for maximizing the sum SE. The formulated problem is under per-AP transmit power and fronthaul constraints, and is based on only long-term channel state information (CSI). The challenging formulated problem is transformed into tractable form and a novel algorithm is proposed to solve it using minorization maximization (MM) technique. We analyze the trade-offs provided by the CF-mMIMO system with different number of CB clusters, hence highlighting the importance of the appropriate choice of CB design for different system setups. Numerical results show that for the centralized CB, the proposed power optimization provides nearly 59% improvement in the average sum SE over the heuristic approach, and 312% improvement, when the distributed beamforming is employed.

### [12] [Joint Error Correction and Fading Channel Estimation Enhancement Leveraging GRAND](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14756)
*Charles Wiame,Ken R. Duffy,Muriel Médard*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出两种基于GRAND解码器的新方法，用于纠正衰落信道估计误差（CEE），通过并行测试多个信道估计候选方案并使用ORBGRAND确定最可能码字，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在衰落信道估计误差显著时，传统不调整无线收发器的做法会导致性能损失，因此需要新的纠错方法，而非通过增加导频序列或改进估计算法。

Method: 1. 测试围绕原始导频估计的多个复杂邻域内的信道候选方案，并行计算LLR并输入ORBGRAND。2. 在LLR计算中考虑残余CEE的改进版本。两种方法均用于评估5G NR CA-Polar和CRC码。

Result: 在忽略CEE的情况下，新方法可带来几dB的块误码率（BLER）增益。

Conclusion: 基于GRAND的纠错方法在显著衰落信道估计误差下表现出色，显著优于传统忽略CEE的方案。

Abstract: We present a novel method for error correction in the presence of fading channel estimation errors (CEE). When such errors are significant, considerable performance losses can be observed if the wireless transceiver is not adapted. Instead of refining the estimate by increasing the pilot sequence length or improving the estimation algorithm, we propose two new approaches based on Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) decoders. The first method involves testing multiple candidates for the channel estimate located in the complex neighborhood around the original pilot-based estimate. All these candidates are employed in parallel to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLR). These LLRs are used as soft input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). Posterior likelihood formulas associated with ORBGRAND are then computed to determine which channel candidate leads to the most probable codeword. The second method is a refined version of the first approach accounting for the presence of residual CEE in the LLR computation. The performance of these two techniques is evaluated for [128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar and CRC codes. For the considered settings, block error rate (BLER) gains of several dBs are observed compared to cases where CEE is ignored.

Abstract: We present a method for estimating ego-velocity in autonomous navigation by integrating high-resolution imaging radar with an inertial measurement unit. The proposed approach addresses the limitations of traditional radar-based ego-motion estimation techniques by employing a neural network to process complex-valued raw radar data and estimate instantaneous linear ego-velocity along with its associated uncertainty. This uncertainty-aware velocity estimate is then integrated with inertial measurement unit data using an Extended Kalman Filter. The filter leverages the network-predicted uncertainty to refine the inertial sensor's noise and bias parameters, improving the overall robustness and accuracy of the ego-motion estimation. We evaluated the proposed method on the publicly available ColoRadar dataset. Our approach achieves significantly lower error compared to the closest publicly available method and also outperforms both instantaneous and scan matching-based techniques.

Abstract: The field of backscatter communication has undergone a profound transformation, evolving from a niche technology for radio-frequency identification (RFID) into a sophisticated paradigm poised to enable a truly battery-free Internet of Things (IoT). This evolution is built upon a deepening understanding of the fundamental principles governing these ultra-low-power links. Modern backscatter systems are no longer simple reflectors of continuous waves but are increasingly designed to interact with complex, data-carrying ambient signals from ubiquitous sources like WiFi, ZigBee, and cellular networks. This review systematically charts the journey of ambient backscatter, particularly focusing on its interaction with ZigBee and other commodity wireless protocols over the last decade. We analyze the progression from foundational proof-of-concept systems that established productive backscatter to modern high-throughput, concurrent, and cross-technology communication architectures. Key advancements in fine-grained modulation, robust synchronization, cross-technology physical layer emulation, and multi-tag coordination are detailed. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art systems highlights the core trade-offs between performance metrics like data rate and range, power consumption, and compatibility with commodity hardware. Finally, we synthesize the primary challenges, including networking scalability, security vulnerabilities, the near-far problem, and practical deployment hurdles, and outline future research directions, such as integration with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and 6G networks, that promise to further expand the capabilities of this transformative technology.
