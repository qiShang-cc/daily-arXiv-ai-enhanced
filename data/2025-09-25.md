Abstract: In this paper we discuss several surprisingly simple methods for transforming
the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2) microcontroller into a radio transmitter, by using
only cheap off the shelf electronic components, and open source software. While
initially this transformation may look as a harmless curiosity, in some extreme

### [2] [A Federated Fine-Tuning Paradigm of Foundation Models in Heterogenous Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19306)
*Jingyi Wang,Zhongyuan Zhao,Qingtian Wang,Zexu Li,Yue Wang,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线学习优化的联邦微调方法，以解决无线网络中设备异构性和资源限制对边缘智能性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘智能在移动设备中提供低延迟和普适服务，但设备异构性和资源限制对联邦微调性能构成威胁。

Method: 提出动态切换LoRA模块的联邦微调框架，并基于理论分析推导了推理风险差距的上界。通过分解非凸混合整数规划问题，开发了一种在线优化算法。

Result: 在SST-2和QNLI数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在测试准确性和能源效率上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过在线学习优化的联邦微调方法有效解决了无线网络中的设备异构性和资源限制问题，提升了边缘智能性能。

Abstract: Edge intelligence has emerged as a promising strategy to deliver low-latency
and ubiquitous services for mobile devices. Recent advances in fine-tuning
mechanisms of foundation models have enabled edge intelligence by integrating
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning. However, in wireless
networks, the device heterogeneity and resource constraints on edge devices
pose great threats to the performance of federated fine-tuning. To tackle these
issues, we propose to optimize federated fine-tuning in heterogenous wireless
networks via online learning. First, the framework of switching-based federated
fine-tuning in wireless networks is provided. The edge devices switches to LoRA
modules dynamically for federated fine-tuning with base station to jointly
mitigate the impact of device heterogeneity and transmission unreliability.
Second, a tractable upper bound on the inference risk gap is derived based on
theoretical analysis. To improve the generalization capability, we formulate a
non-convex mixed-integer programming problem with long-term constraints, and
decouple it into model switching, transmit power control, and bandwidth
allocation subproblems. An online optimization algorithm is developed to solve
the problems with polynomial computational complexity. Finally, the simulation
results on the SST-2 and QNLI data sets demonstrate the performance gains in
test accuracy and energy efficiency.

### [3] [Bandwidth of Gamma-Distribution-Shaped Functions via Lambert W Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19307)
*Anthony LoPrete,Johannes Burge*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 推导并提出了伽马分布概率密度函数（PDF）的半高全宽（FWHM）的解析表达式，并与其他近似方法进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伽马分布的概率密度函数在实际应用中常见，但其半高全宽的闭式表达式尚未广泛提供，因此需要推导这一表达式以满足实际需求。

Method: 利用Lambert W函数计算伽马PDF的逆函数，从而推导出伽马分布在任意比例处的宽度解析表达式，进而得到FWHM。

Result: 成功推导出伽马形状函数的FWHM的精确解析表达式，并提供了八度带宽的表达式，与高斯近似进行了比较。

Conclusion: 本研究填补了伽马分布FWHM闭式表达式的空白，为相关领域的研究提供了有用的工具。

Abstract: The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is a useful quantity for characterizing
the bandwidth of unimodal functions. However, a closed-form expression for the
FWHM of gamma-shaped functions-i.e. functions that are shaped like the gamma
distribution probability density function (PDF)-is not widely available. Here,
we derive and present just such an expression. To do so, we use the Lambert W
function to compute the inverse of the gamma PDF. We use this inverse to derive
an exact analytic expression for the width of a gamma distribution at an
arbitrary proportion of the maximum, from which the FWHM follows trivially. (An
expression for the octave bandwidth of gamma-shaped functions is also
provided.) The FWHM is then compared to the Gaussian approximation of
gamma-shaped functions. A few other related issues are discussed.

### [4] [Graph-Based Spatio-temporal Attention and Multi-Scale Fusion for Clinically Interpretable, High-Fidelity Fetal ECG Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19308)
*Chang Wang,Ming Zhu,Shahram Latifi,Buddhadeb Dawn,Shengjie Zhai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为FetalHealthNet（FHNet）的深度学习框架，用于从腹部心电图中提取干净的胎儿心电图信号，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先天性心脏病是新生儿常见疾病，早期检测需求迫切，但胎儿心电图信号常被母体心电图和噪音掩盖，传统方法在低信噪比条件下表现不佳。

Method: 结合图神经网络和多尺度增强变压器，动态建模导联间的时空关联，提取胎儿心电图信号。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，R2>0.99，RMSE=0.015，即使在高噪音条件下。

Conclusion: FHNet展示了AI在胎儿监测和早期先天性心脏病筛查中的潜力，推动了生物医学信号处理的革新。

Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common neonatal anomaly,
highlighting the urgent need for early detection to improve outcomes. Yet,
fetal ECG (fECG) signals in abdominal ECG (aECG) are often masked by maternal
ECG and noise, challenging conventional methods under low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) conditions. We propose FetalHealthNet (FHNet), a deep learning framework
that integrates Graph Neural Networks with a multi-scale enhanced transformer
to dynamically model spatiotemporal inter-lead correlations and extract clean
fECG signals. On benchmark aECG datasets, FHNet consistently outperforms long
short-term memory (LSTM) models, standard transformers, and state-of-the-art
models, achieving R2>0.99 and RMSE = 0.015 even under severe noise.
Interpretability analyses highlight physiologically meaningful temporal and
lead contributions, supporting model transparency and clinical trust. FHNet
illustrates the potential of AI-driven modeling to advance fetal monitoring and
enable early CHD screening, underscoring the transformative impact of
next-generation biomedical signal processing.

### [5] [A Novel Two-Dimensional Wigner Distribution Framework via the Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform with a Non-Separable Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19310)
*Mukul Chauhan,Waseem Z. Lone,Amit K. Verma*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的时频分布方法2D-NSQPWD，基于2D-NSQPFT框架，能有效捕捉复杂非分离信号结构，并展示了其在交叉项抑制和信号定位上的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决复杂非分离信号的时频分析问题，扩展经典Wigner分布的应用范围。

Method: 通过将经典傅里叶核替换为NSQPFT核，提出了2D-NSQPWD方法，并验证了其关键性质。

Result: 在单、双和三组分2D-LFM信号中表现出卓越的交叉项抑制和信号定位能力。

Conclusion: 2D-NSQPWD是一种高效的时频分析工具，适用于复杂信号处理。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel time-frequency distribution, referred to as the
Two-Dimensional Non-Separable Quadratic Phase Wigner Distribution (2D-NSQPWD),
formulated within the framework of the Two-Dimensional Non-Separable Quadratic
Phase Fourier Transform (2D-NSQPFT). By replacing the classical Fourier kernel
with the NSQPFT kernel, the proposed distribution generalizes the classical
Wigner distribution and effectively captures complex, non-separable signal
structures. We rigorously establish several key properties of the 2D-NSQPWD,
including time and frequency shift invariance, marginal behavior, conjugate
symmetry, convolution relations, and Moyal's identity. Furthermore, the
connection between the 2D-NSQPWD and the two-dimensional short-time Fourier
transform (2D-STFT) is explored. The distribution's effectiveness is
demonstrated through its application to single-, bi-, and tri-component
two-dimensional linear frequency modulated (2D-LFM) signals, where it shows
superior performance in cross-term suppression and signal localization.

### [6] [E2E Learning Massive MIMO for Multimodal Semantic Non-Orthogonal Transmission and Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19312)
*Minghui Wu,Zhen Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个端到端的上下行CSI融合预编码网络，通过联合建模下行CSI参考信号设计、CSI反馈和基站预编码，有效提升了大规模MIMO系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模MIMO系统虽然提供了高频谱效率，但高维下行CSI的获取和实时预编码带来了复杂性问题，需要一种更高效的方法来解决。

Method: 提出了基于MAXIM架构的投影网络，结合上下行信号信息，设计反馈和预编码模块，并通过三阶段训练优化性能。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法通过融合上行SRS信息和用户反馈显著优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: 该端到端网络有效地利用了上下行信号信息，为大规模MIMO系统的CSI获取和预编码提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) promises high spectral
efficiency but also leads to high-dimensional downlink channel state
information (CSI), which complicates real-time channel acquisition and
precoding. To address this, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) uplink-downlink CSI
fusion precoding network that jointly models downlink CSI reference signal
(CSI-RS) design, CSI feedback, and base-station (BS) precoding within a single
E2E neural architecture. Concretely, a projection network built on the MAXIM
architecture takes uplink sounding reference signals (SRS) as input and outputs
frequency-, beam-, and port-domain projection matrices for designing downlink
CSI-RS. User equipment (UE) then compresses/quantizes the resulting CSI-RS
observations and feeds back a compact representation. At the base station (BS),
two complementary branches produce candidate precoders: one is a feedback-only
precoding network driven by quantized downlink observations, and the other is
an SRS-only precoding network driven by uplink SRS. These candidate precoders
are subsequently combined by a fusion precoding network to yield the final
transmit precoder. All the modules are trained with a
spectral-efficiency-oriented loss under a three-stage schedule. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach effectively harnesses both SRS-derived
information and UE feedback, achieving markedly better performance than
conventional baselines.

### [7] [STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM: An Effective Wave Height High Accuracy Prediction Model Fusing Time-Frequency Domain Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19313)
*Huipeng Liu,Zhichao Zhu,Yuan Zhou,Changlu Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM的混合模型，用于高效准确地预测显著波高（WVHT）。该方法在多尺度特征融合、极端波高捕获以及高频噪声和周期性信号处理方面表现出色，实验结果表明其在预测精度上优于其他模型。


<details>

Conclusion: STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM模型在处理波能预测问题上表现出显著优势，验证了其多尺度特征融合的有效性。

Abstract: As the consumption of traditional energy sources intensifies and their
adverse environmental impacts become more pronounced, wave energy stands out as
a highly promising member of the renewable energy family due to its high energy
density, stability, widespread distribution, and environmental friendliness.
The key to its development lies in the precise prediction of Significant Wave
Height (WVHT). However, wave energy signals exhibit strong nonlinearity, abrupt
changes, multi-scale periodicity, data sparsity, and high-frequency noise
interference; additionally, physical models for wave energy prediction incur
extremely high computational costs. To address these challenges, this study
proposes a hybrid model combining STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM. This model exploits
the Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on Loess (STL), Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technologies. The model aims
to optimize multi-scale feature fusion, capture extreme wave heights, and
address issues related to high-frequency noise and periodic signals, thereby
achieving efficient and accurate prediction of significant wave height.
Experiments were conducted using hourly data from NOAA Station 41008 and 41047
spanning 2019 to 2022. The results showed that compared with other single
models and hybrid models, the STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM model achieved
significantly higher prediction accuracy in capturing extreme wave heights and
suppressing high-frequency noise, with MAE reduced by 15.8\%-40.5\%, SMAPE
reduced by 8.3\%-20.3\%, and R increased by 1.31\%-2.9\%; in ablation
experiments, the model also demonstrated the indispensability of each component
step, validating its superiority in multi-scale feature fusion.

### [8] [Advancing Few-Shot Pediatric Arrhythmia Classification with a Novel Contrastive Loss and Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19315)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种多模态端到端深度学习框架，结合心电图和内电图的特征提取，引入自适应全局类感知对比损失函数，显著提升儿科心律失常的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿科心律失常是导致残疾和心源性猝死的主要风险因素，但其自动分类因类别不平衡、样本稀少和信号复杂等问题而极具挑战性。

Method: 采用双分支卷积编码器处理ECG和IEGM信号，结合语义注意力机制和轻量级Transformer，并引入自适应全局类感知对比损失函数（AGCACL）。

Result: 在性能指标上全面超越基线方法，Top-1准确率达97.76%，Macro Precision/Recall/F1/F2均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架显著改善了少数心律失常类别的检测能力，对儿科和先天性心脏病患者的临床筛查和治疗具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Pediatric arrhythmias are a major risk factor for disability and sudden
cardiac death, yet their automated classification remains challenging due to
class imbalance, few-shot categories, and complex signal characteristics, which
severely limit the efficiency and reliability of early screening and clinical
intervention. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal end-to-end deep
learning framework that combines dual-branch convolutional encoders for ECG and
IEGM, semantic attention for cross-modal feature alignment, and a lightweight
Transformer encoder for global dependency modeling. In addition, we introduce a
new contrastive loss fucntion named Adaptive Global Class-Aware Contrastive
Loss (AGCACL) to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability
through class prototypes and a global similarity matrix. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first systematic study based on the Leipzig Heart Center
pediatric/congenital ECG+IEGM dataset, for which we also provide a complete and
reproducible preprocessing pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves the overall best performance on this dataset,
including 97.76\% Top-1 Accuracy, 94.08\% Macro Precision, 91.97\% Macro
Recall, 92.97\% Macro F1, and 92.36\% Macro F2, with improvements of +13.64,
+15.96, +19.82, and +19.44 percentage points over the strongest baseline in
Macro Precision/Recall/F1/F2, respectively. These findings indicate that the
framework significantly improves the detectability and robustness for minority
arrhythmia classes, offering potential clinical value for rhythm screening,
pre-procedural assessment, and postoperative follow-up in pediatric and
congenital heart disease populations.

*Ammar Kamoona,Hui Song,Ali Moradi Amani,Mahdi Jalili,Xinghuo Yu,Peter McTaggart*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了从智能电表记录中识别电动汽车充电负荷的无监督学习方法，用于电网规划和管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电网运营商需要了解网络中的电动汽车充电需求以优化电网管理，但传统方法需要充电数据。

Result: TAE在澳大利亚维多利亚州的智能电表数据中表现优异，能有效识别电动汽车用户。

Conclusion: 该方法无需先验充电数据，为电网管理提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging loads identification from behind smart meter
recordings is an indispensable aspect that enables effective decision-making
for energy distributors to reach an informed and intelligent decision about the
power grid's reliability. When EV charging happens behind the meter (BTM), the
charging occurs on the customer side of the meter, which measures the overall
electricity consumption. In other words, the charging of the EV is considered
part of the customer's load and not separately measured by the Distribution
Network Operators (DNOs). DNOs require complete knowledge about the EV presence
in their network. Identifying the EV charging demand is essential to better
plan and manage the distribution grid. Unlike supervised methods, this paper
addresses the problem of EV charging load identification in a non-nonintrusive
manner from low-frequency smart meter using an unsupervised learning approach
based on anomaly detection technique. Our approach does not require prior
knowledge of EV charging profiles. It only requires real power consumption data
of non-EV users, which are abundant in practice. We propose a deep temporal
convolution encoding decoding (TAE) network. The TAE is applied to power
consumption from smart BTM from Victorian households in Australia, and the TAE
shows superior performance in identifying households with EVs.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Scensory的机器人嗅觉系统，通过VOC传感器阵列和深度学习实时监测和定位室内真菌污染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真菌检测方法慢、成本高且缺乏空间分辨率，无法满足实时监测需求。

Method: 利用可负担的VOC传感器阵列和深度学习技术，解析VOC动态中的化学和空间特征。

Result: 系统在五种真菌中检测准确率达89.85%，定位准确率达87.31%，每次预测仅需3-7秒传感器输入。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了实时、空间感知的真菌监测，为自主环境传感提供了可扩展且经济的框架。

Abstract: Indoor fungal contamination poses significant risks to public health, yet
existing detection methods are slow, costly, and lack spatial resolution.
Conventional approaches rely on laboratory analysis or high-concentration
sampling, making them unsuitable for real-time monitoring and scalable
deployment. We introduce \textbf{\textit{Scensory}}, a robot-enabled olfactory
system that simultaneously identifies fungal species and localizes their
spatial origin using affordable volatile organic compound (VOC) sensor arrays
and deep learning. Our key idea is that temporal VOC dynamics encode both
chemical and spatial signatures, which we decode through neural architectures
trained on robot-automated data collection. We demonstrate two operational
modes: a passive multi-array configuration for environmental monitoring, and a
mobile single-array configuration for active source tracking. Across five
fungal species, our system achieves up to 89.85\% accuracy in species detection
and 87.31\% accuracy in localization under ambient conditions, where each
prediction only takes 3--7\,s sensor inputs. Additionally, by computationally
analyzing model behavior, we can uncover key biochemical signatures without
additional laboratory experiments. Our approach enables real-time, spatially
aware fungal monitoring and establishes a scalable and affordable framework for
autonomous environmental sensing.

### [11] [Human Activity Recognition Based on Electrocardiogram Data Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19328)
*Sina Montazeri,Waltenegus Dargie,Yunhe Feng,Kewei Sha*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文首次展示了仅使用心电图（ECG）对六种不同活动进行稳健识别的能力，超越了之前的工作范围。通过设计和评估三种新的深度学习模型，证明了ECG在活动识别中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的活动识别依赖于惯性测量单元（IMUs），但其资源消耗大且需要校准。ECG基于的方法通常仅作为IMU的补充或用于粗略分类。本文旨在探索仅用ECG进行多活动识别的可行性。

Method: 设计了三种深度学习模型：带有Squeeze-and-Excitation块的CNN分类器、带有扩张卷积的ResNet分类器以及新颖的CNNTransformer混合模型。

Result: 三种模型在54名受试者的六种活动数据上均实现了超过94%的准确率（已知受试者）。CNNTransformer混合模型在新受试者中达到72%的最高准确率。

Conclusion: 研究首次证明了仅用ECG进行多活动分类的成功，为开发下一代可穿戴设备（同时监测心脏活动和识别活动）提供了重要潜力。

Abstract: Human activity recognition is critical for applications such as early
intervention and health analytics. Traditional activity recognition relies on
inertial measurement units (IMUs), which are resource intensive and require
calibration. Although electrocardiogram (ECG)-based methods have been explored,
these have typically served as supplements to IMUs or have been limited to
broad categorical classification such as fall detection or active vs. inactive
in daily activities. In this paper, we advance the field by demonstrating, for
the first time, robust recognition of activity only with ECG in six distinct
activities, which is beyond the scope of previous work. We design and evaluate
three new deep learning models, including a CNN classifier with
Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for channel-wise feature recalibration, a ResNet
classifier with dilated convolutions for multiscale temporal dependency
capture, and a novel CNNTransformer hybrid combining convolutional feature
extraction with attention mechanisms for long-range temporal relationship
modeling. Tested on data from 54 subjects for six activities, all three models
achieve over 94% accuracy for seen subjects, while CNNTransformer hybrid
reaching the best accuracy of 72% for unseen subjects, a result that can be
further improved by increasing the training population. This study demonstrates
the first successful ECG-only activity classification in multiple physical
activities, offering significant potential for developing next-generation
wearables capable of simultaneous cardiac monitoring and activity recognition
without additional motion sensors.

Abstract: EEG-based multimodal emotion recognition(EMER) has gained significant
attention and witnessed notable advancements, the inherent complexity of human
neural systems has motivated substantial efforts toward multimodal approaches.
However, this field currently suffers from three critical limitations: (i) the
absence of open-source implementations. (ii) the lack of standardized and
transparent benchmarks for fair performance analysis. (iii) in-depth discussion

scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce LibEMER, a unified
evaluation framework that provides fully reproducible PyTorch implementations
of curated deep learning methods alongside standardized protocols for data
preprocessing, model realization, and experimental setups. This framework
enables unbiased performance assessment on three widely-used public datasets
across two learning tasks. The open-source library is publicly accessible at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度模型在处理复数信号时仅关注实值相关性，忽略了振幅与相位之间的干扰效应。

Method: 采用全息注意力机制，通过相对相位调制交互，同时使用双头解码器防止相位塌缩。

Result: 在PolSAR图像分类和无线信道预测任务中表现优异，分类准确率和F1分数高，回归误差低，且对相位扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过物理一致性约束注意力机制，能显著提升复数信号学习的泛化能力，并提供了一种统一、基于物理的相干信号建模框架。

Abstract: Complex-valued signals encode both amplitude and phase, yet most deep models
treat attention as real-valued correlation, overlooking interference effects.
We introduce the Holographic Transformer, a physics-inspired architecture that
incorporates wave interference principles into self-attention. Holographic
attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes
values, ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase. A dual-headed decoder
simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing
phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that
holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains
phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image
classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance,
achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and
increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that
enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements
in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for
coherent signal modeling. The code is available at

Abstract: To address the issue of limited channels and insufficient information
collection in portable EEG devices, this study explores an EEG virtual channel
signal generation network using a novel spatio-temporal feature fusion
strategy. Based on the EEG signals from four frontal lobe channels, the network
aims to generate virtual channel EEG signals for other 13 important brain
regions. The architecture of the network is a two-dimensional convolutional
neural network and it includes a parallel module for temporal and spatial
domain feature extraction, followed by a feature fusion module. The public
PRED+CT database, which includes multi-channel EEG signals from 119 subjects,
was selected to verify the constructed network. The results showed that the
average correlation coefficient between the generated virtual channel EEG
signals and the original real signals was 0.6724, with an average absolute
error of 3.9470. Furthermore, the 13 virtual channel EEG signals were combined
with the original EEG signals of four brain regions and then used for anxiety
classification with a support vector machine. The results indicate that the
virtual EEG signals generated by the constructed network not only have a high
degree of consistency with the real channel EEG signals but also significantly
enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms for anxiety
classification. This study effectively alleviates the problem of insufficient
information acquisition by portable EEG devices with few channels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 散射体感知在ISAC中至关重要，但现有方法要么需要波形或硬件修改，要么依赖传统信号处理方案，导致兼容性差且精度有限。因此，作者旨在提出一种无需修改现有系统的解决方案。

Method: 论文提出的CSIYOLO框架包括两个主要部分：基于锚点的散射体参数检测和基于CSI的散射体定位。通过将参数提取建模为图像检测问题，并借鉴YOLO架构，设计了多尺度锚点检测和噪声注入训练策略，以提高精度和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，CSIYOLO在不同散射体数量和估计误差下，能显著优于现有方法的定位精度，且复杂度较低。

Conclusion: CSIYOLO作为一种无需修改现有通信系统的插件方案，实现了散射体的高精度定位，为ISAC的实际应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: ISAC is regarded as a promising technology for next-generation communication
systems, enabling simultaneous data transmission and target sensing. Among
various tasks in ISAC, scatter sensing plays a crucial role in exploiting the
full potential of ISAC and supporting applications such as autonomous driving
and low-altitude economy. However, most existing methods rely on either
waveform and hardware modifications or traditional signal processing schemes,
leading to poor compatibility with current communication systems and limited
sensing accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CSIYOLO, a framework
that performs scatter localization only using estimated CSI from a single base
station-user equipment pair. This framework comprises two main components:
anchor-based scatter parameter detection and CSI-based scatter localization.
First, by formulating scatter parameter extraction as an image detection
problem, we propose an anchor-based scatter parameter detection method inspired
by You Only Look Once architectures. After that, a CSI-based localization
algorithm is derived to determine scatter locations with extracted parameters.
Moreover, to improve localization accuracy and implementation efficiency, we
design an extendable network structure with task-oriented optimizations,
enabling multi-scale anchor detection and better adaptation to CSI
characteristics. A noise injection training strategy is further designed to
enhance robustness against channel estimation errors. Since the proposed
framework operates solely on estimated CSI without modifying waveforms or
signal processing pipelines, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing
communication systems as a plugin. Experiments show that our proposed method
can significantly outperform existing methods in scatter localization accuracy
with relatively low complexities under varying numbers of scatters and
estimation errors.

Conclusion: 该框架在流体天线辅助的移动边缘计算系统中表现出优越性，为解决信道估计和联合优化问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: With the emergence of fluid antenna (FA) in wireless communications, the
capability to dynamically adjust port positions offers substantial benefits in
spatial diversity and spectrum efficiency, which are particularly valuable for
mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. Therefore, we propose an FA-assisted MEC
offloading framework to minimize system delay. This framework faces two severe
challenges, which are the complexity of channel estimation due to dynamic port
configuration and the inherent non-convexity of the joint optimization problem.
Firstly, we propose Information Bottleneck Metric-enhanced Channel Compressed
Sensing (IBM-CCS), which advances FA channel estimation by integrating
information relevance into the sensing process and capturing key features of FA
channels effectively. Secondly, to address the non-convex and high-dimensional
optimization problem in FA-assisted MEC systems, which includes FA port
selection, beamforming, power control, and resource allocation, we propose a
game theory-assisted Hierarchical Twin-Dueling Multi-agent Algorithm (HiTDMA)
based offloading scheme, where the hierarchical structure effectively decouples
and coordinates the optimization tasks between the user side and the base
station side. Crucially, the game theory effectively reduces the dimensionality
of power control variables, allowing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents
to achieve improved optimization efficiency. Numerical results confirm that the
proposed scheme significantly reduces system delay and enhances offloading
performance, outperforming benchmarks. Additionally, the IBM-CCS channel
estimation demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness under varying port
densities, contributing to efficient communication under imperfect CSI.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于测量报告（MR）数据的低成本和高效的局部统计信道建模（LSCM）框架，用于数字孪生网络优化中的性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LSCM方法依赖高成本的drive test数据，空间覆盖有限，需低成本、广泛覆盖的替代方案。

Method: 框架包含MR定位模块（半监督超图神经网络）和联合网格构建与信道APS估计模块（聚类与稀疏恢复优化）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定位和信道建模中表现出优异的性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LSCM提供了一种低成本、高效的解决方案，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is crucial for effective
performance evaluation in digital twin-assisted network optimization. Solely
relying on the multi-beam reference signal receiving power (RSRP), LSCM aims to
model the localized statistical propagation environment by estimating the
channel angular power spectrum (APS). However, existing methods rely heavily on
drive test data with high collection costs and limited spatial coverage. In
this paper, we propose a measurement report (MR) data-driven framework for
LSCM, exploiting the low-cost and extensive collection of MR data. The
framework comprises two novel modules. The MR localization module addresses the
issue of missing locations in MR data by introducing a semi-supervised method
based on hypergraph neural networks, which exploits multi-modal information via
distance-aware hypergraph modeling and hypergraph convolution for location
extraction. To enhance the computational efficiency and solution robustness,
LSCM operates at the grid level. Compared to independently constructing
geographically uniform grids and estimating channel APS, the joint grid
construction and channel APS estimation module enhances robustness in complex
environments with spatially non-uniform data by exploiting their correlation.
This module alternately optimizes grid partitioning and APS estimation using
clustering and improved sparse recovery for the ill-conditioned measurement
matrix and incomplete observations. Through comprehensive experiments on a
real-world MR dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance and robustness
of our framework in localization and channel modeling.

Abstract: We present a sensor-fusion framework for rapid, non-destructive
classification and quality control of organic substances, built on a standard
Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller platform equipped with three commercial
environmental and gas sensors. All data used in this study were generated
in-house: sensor outputs for ten distinct classes - including fresh and expired
samples of apple juice, onion, garlic, and ginger, as well as cinnamon and
cardamom - were systematically collected and labeled using this hardware setup,
resulting in a unique, application-specific dataset. Correlation analysis was
employed as part of the preprocessing pipeline for feature selection. After
preprocessing and dimensionality reduction (PCA/LDA), multiple supervised
learning models - including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT),
and Random Forest (RF), each with hyperparameter tuning, as well as an
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and an ensemble voting classifier - were
trained and cross-validated on the collected dataset. The best-performing
models, including tuned Random Forest, ensemble, and ANN, achieved test
accuracies in the 93 to 94 percent range. These results demonstrate that
low-cost, multisensory platforms based on the Arduino Mega 2560, combined with

Abstract: This study presents the development and optimization of a deep learning model
based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict short-term hourly
electricity demand in C\'ordoba, Argentina. Integrating historical consumption
data with exogenous variables (climatic factors, temporal cycles, and
demographic statistics), the model achieved high predictive precision, with a
mean absolute percentage error of 3.20\% and a determination coefficient of

crucial to capture seasonal patterns and extreme consumption events, enhancing
the robustness and generalizability of the model. In addition to the design and
hyperparameter optimization of the LSTM architecture, two complementary
analyses were carried out: (i) an interpretability study using Random Forest
regression to quantify the relative importance of exogenous drivers, and (ii)
an evaluation of model performance in predicting the timing of daily demand
maxima and minima, achieving exact-hour accuracy in more than two-thirds of the
test days and within abs(1) hour in over 90\% of cases. Together, these results
highlight both the predictive accuracy and operational relevance of the
proposed framework, providing valuable insights for grid operators seeking
optimized planning and control strategies under diverse demand scenarios.

Abstract: Passive intermodulation (PIM) has emerged as a critical source of
self-interference in modern MIMO-OFDM systems, especially under the stringent

complex nonlinear models with limited scalability and high computational cost.
In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for PIM
cancellation that leverages depthwise separable convolutions and dilated
convolutions to efficiently capture nonlinear dependencies across antennas and
subcarriers. To further enhance convergence, we adopt a cyclic learning rate
schedule and gradient clipping. In a controlled MIMO experimental setup, the
method effectively suppresses third-order passive intermodulation (PIM)
distortion, achieving up to 29dB of average power error (APE) with only 11k
trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of compact neural
architectures for scalable interference mitigation in future wireless
communication systems.

Conclusion: 优化发射功率和反射元件数量可有效减轻低精度ADC的负面影响，ARIS-NOMA系统在性能和效率上更具优势。

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of an active reconfigurable intelligent
surface (ARIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system employing
low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Analytical approximations
for the outage probability (OP) are derived, considering residual hardware
impairments (RHIs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC).
Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic OP, system throughput, and diversity
order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed quantized ARIS-NOMA system outperforms its passive
counterpart (PRIS-NOMA), achieving lower OP and higher throughput with reduced
transmit power requirements and fewer reflecting elements. Moreover, the outage
performance of both quantized ARIS-NOMA and PRIS-NOMA systems demonstrates
significant improvement as the number of reflecting elements increases. The
negative impacts of low-precision ADCs can be effectively mitigated by
optimizing transmit power and scaling the number of reflecting elements.

Result: AUWave在夏威夷区域的验证损失最低为0.043285，空间误差在观测站点附近最低；在数据较丰富配置下持续优于基线方法。

Conclusion: AUWave为填补数据空白、数据同化和应急重建提供了可扩展的高分辨率解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution regional significant wave height fields from
sparse and uneven buoy observations remains a core challenge for ocean
monitoring and risk-aware operations. We introduce AUWave, a hybrid deep
learning framework that fuses a station-wise sequence encoder (MLP) with a
multi-scale U-Net enhanced by a bottleneck self-attention layer to recover
32$\times$32 regional SWH fields. A systematic Bayesian hyperparameter search
with Optuna identifies the learning rate as the dominant driver of
generalization, followed by the scheduler decay and the latent dimension. Using
NDBC buoy observations and ERA5 reanalysis over the Hawaii region, AUWave
attains a minimum validation loss of 0.043285 and a slightly right-skewed RMSE
distribution. Spatial errors are lowest near observation sites and increase
with distance, reflecting identifiability limits under sparse sampling.
Sensitivity experiments show that AUWave consistently outperforms a
representative baseline in data-richer configurations, while the baseline is
only marginally competitive in the most underdetermined single-buoy cases. The
architecture's multi-scale and attention components translate into accuracy
gains when minimal but non-trivial spatial anchoring is available. Error maps
and buoy ablations reveal key anchor stations whose removal disproportionately
degrades performance, offering actionable guidance for network design. AUWave
provides a scalable pathway for gap filling, high-resolution priors for data
assimilation, and contingency reconstruction.

Abstract: Effective control of neural interfaces is limited by poor signal quality.
While neural network-based electroencephalography (EEG) denoising methods for
electromyogenic (EMG) artifacts have improved in recent years, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models perform suboptimally in settings with high
noise. To address the shortcomings of current machine learning (ML)-based
denoising algorithms, we present a signal filtration algorithm driven by a new
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. Our algorithm leverages three new
statistical insights into the EEG-EMG denoising problem: (1) EMG artifacts can
be partitioned into quantifiable subtypes to aid downstream MoE classification,
(2) local experts trained on narrower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges can
achieve performance increases through specialization, and (3) correlation-based
objective functions, in conjunction with rescaling algorithms, can enable
faster convergence in a neural network-based denoising context. We empirically
demonstrate these three insights into EMG artifact removal and use our findings
to create a new downstream MoE denoising algorithm consisting of convolutional
(CNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks. We tested all results on a major
benchmark dataset (EEGdenoiseNet) collected from 67 subjects. We found that our
MoE denoising model achieved competitive overall performance with SOTA ML
denoising algorithms and superior lower bound performance in high noise
settings. These preliminary results highlight the promise of our MoE framework
for enabling advances in EMG artifact removal for EEG processing, especially in
high noise settings. Further research and development will be necessary to
assess our MoE framework on a wider range of real-world test cases and explore
its downstream potential to unlock more effective neural interfaces.

Method: 使用双边移动平均滤波器抑制高频背景活动，计算残差信号的均值和标准差作为特征向量，输入浅层ANN进行分类。

Result: 在12名患者的780通道EEG数据中，方法检测到384/392事件（98%灵敏度），特异性96.2%，准确率97.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分析特征和轻量级ANN实现了高效、实时且无需人工干预的SWDs自动检测，适用于长期EEG记录。

Abstract: Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) are the electroencephalographic hallmark of
absence epilepsy, yet their manual identification in multi-day recordings
remains labour-intensive and error-prone. We present a lightweight hybrid
pipeline that couples analytical features with a shallow artificial neural
network (ANN) for accurate, patient-specific SWD detection in long-term,
monopolar EEG. A two-sided moving-average (MA) filter first suppresses the
high-frequency components of normal background activity. The residual signal is
then summarised by the mean and the standard deviation of its normally
distributed samples, yielding a compact, two-dimensional feature vector for
every 20s window. These features are fed to a single-hidden-layer ANN trained
via back-propagation to classify each window as SWD or non-SWD. The method was
evaluated on 780 channels sampled at 256 Hz from 12 patients, comprising 392
annotated SWD events. It correctly detected 384 events (sensitivity: 98%) while
achieving a specificity of 96.2 % and an overall accuracy of 97.2%. Because
feature extraction is analytic, and the classifier is small, the pipeline runs
in real-time and requires no manual threshold tuning. These results indicate
that normal-distribution descriptors combined with a modest ANN provide an
effective and computationally inexpensive solution for automated SWD screening
in extended EEG recordings.

Conclusion: SelfMIS通过潜在空间对齐显著提升了单导联ECG对心肌梗死的检测能力，为相关诊断提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a critical manifestation of coronary artery disease,
yet detecting it from single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains challenging
due to limited spatial information. An intuitive idea is to convert single-lead
into multiple-lead ECG for classification by pre-trained models, but generative
methods optimized at the signal level in most cases leave a large latent space
gap, ultimately degrading diagnostic performance. This naturally raises the
question of whether latent space alignment could help. However, most prior ECG
alignment methods focus on learning transformation invariance, which mismatches
the goal of single-lead detection. To address this issue, we propose SelfMIS, a
simple yet effective alignment learning framework to improve myocardial
infarction detection from single-lead ECG. Discarding manual data
augmentations, SelfMIS employs a self-cutting strategy to pair multiple-lead
ECG with their corresponding single-lead segments and directly align them in
the latent space. This design shifts the learning objective from pursuing
transformation invariance to enriching the single-lead representation,
explicitly driving the single-lead ECG encoder to learn a representation
capable of inferring global cardiac context from the local signal.
Experimentally, SelfMIS achieves superior performance over baseline models
across nine myocardial infarction types while maintaining a simpler
architecture and lower computational overhead, thereby substantiating the
efficacy of direct latent space alignment. Our code and checkpoint will be
publicly available after acceptance.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based P300 speller brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) face three main challenges: low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor
generalization, and time-consuming calibration. We propose SpellerSSL, a
framework that combines self-supervised learning (SSL) with P300 aggregation to
address these issues. First, we introduce an aggregation strategy to enhance
SNR. Second, to achieve generalization in training, we employ a customized 1D
U-Net backbone and pretrain the model on both cross-domain and in-domain EEG
data. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned with a lightweight
ERP-Head classifier for P300 detection, which adapts the learned
representations to subject-specific data. Our evaluations on calibration time
demonstrate that combining the aggregation strategy with SSL significantly
reduces the calibration burden per subject and improves robustness across
subjects. Experimental results show that SSL learns effective EEG
representations in both in-domain and cross-domain, with in-domain achieving a
state-of-the-art character recognition rate of 94% with only 7 repetitions and
the highest information transfer rate (ITR) of 21.86 bits/min on the public
II-B dataset. Moreover, in-domain SSL with P300 aggregation reduces the
required calibration size by 60% while maintaining a comparable character
recognition rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
apply SSL to P300 spellers, highlighting its potential to improve both
efficiency and generalization in speller BCIs and paving the way toward an EEG
foundation model for P300 speller BCIs.

Conclusion: 该算法能够快速校准，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Individual differences in brain activity hinder the online application of
electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems. To
overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm
for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The
alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space
and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space.
Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is
computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the
unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate
self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven
decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of
BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is
updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9%
on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery.
These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed
algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.

Result: 研究发现LEO系统信号更强、动态更快，但多普勒范围和速率更高，星座结构独特，需优化接收器设计以减少计算时间和功耗。

Conclusion: 通过优化接收器设计（如改进捕获策略和预测技术），Pulsar系统可实现更快的首次定位时间和更低的功耗，为未来PNT应用提供支持。

Abstract: The landscape of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) is expanding with
the emergence of low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations such as Pulsar, which are
expected to play a key role in the future of positioning, navigation, and
timing (PNT). LEO-based systems provide advantages including stronger signals
for greater robustness, faster dynamics that aid convergence and multipath
mitigation, and shorter time to first fix (TTFF) enabled by high data rates.
These benefits, however, come with changes in signal behavior and constellation
geometry that require careful consideration in receiver design. This paper
investigates Pulsar properties using a GNSS simulator, analyzing parameters
such as satellite pass duration, elevation, Doppler shift, Doppler rate, range,
and number of satellites in view. Comparisons with GPS highlight the
differences introduced by LEO operation. The analysis examines temporal
evolution, statistical distributions, and maximum and minimum values. Beyond
these statistical insights, the study explores interdependencies between
parameters and differences across satellites, providing additional perspective.
Evaluations are performed at multiple latitudes to ensure a worldwide
perspective, and the impact of applying different elevation masks is discussed
where relevant. Building on these findings, the paper assesses Pulsar's impact
on receiver design from two standpoints: design considerations, addressing
expanded Doppler ranges, higher Doppler rates, and unique constellation
structure; and design optimizations, exploiting parameter analyses and
interdependencies (e.g., Doppler rate vs Doppler) to refine acquisition
strategies and applying prediction and prioritization techniques to avoid
unnecessary computations. Together, these optimizations can reduce acquisition
time and lower receiver power consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决XL-MIMO系统中多用户干扰问题，实现实时和可扩展的波束聚焦。

Method: 采用双估计器架构，包含两个全连接深度神经网络（FCDNNs），分别预测NCBF权重的相位和幅度分量，并使用用户位置数据进行训练。

Abstract: This paper proposes a deep learning-based framework for near-field nulling
control beam focusing (NCBF) in extra-large MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems to mitigate
multi-user interference (MUI). A dual-estimator architecture comprising two
fully connected deep neural networks (FCDNNs) is developed to separately
predict the phase and magnitude components of NCBF weights, using locations of
both desired and interfering users. The models are trained on a large dataset
generated via a Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamforming
algorithm to accommodate diverse user configurations, including both collinear
and non-collinear scenarios. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed
DNN models achieve high prediction accuracy, with test errors of only 0.067
radians for phase estimation and 0.206 dB for magnitude estimation. Full-wave
simulations incorporating realistic element radiation patterns and
inter-element coupling confirm the close agreement between the beam patterns
produced by the DNN-predicted and LCMV-based NCBF schemes under practical
deployment conditions. An average MUI suppression of 36.7 dB is achieved, with
interference mitigation exceeding 17.5 dB across all tested cases. The proposed
approach enables scalable and real-time beam focusing with effective
interference suppression, offering a promising solution for future near-field
multi-user wireless communications.

Method: 提出NAPReS方法，通过对大量声门脉冲进行堆叠、求和和修剪，简化数据可视化，并尝试GMM模型拟合共振峰。

Result: NAPReS能够直观展示大量数据并提高低振幅周期性结构的观察性，且在噪声环境下比传统LPC拟合更具重现性。

Conclusion: NAPReS是一种有效的改进方法，适用于复杂环境下的语音分析。

Abstract: Reassigned spectrograms have shown advantages in precise formant measuring
and inter-speaker differentiation. However, reassigned spectrograms suffer from
their inability to visualize larger amounts of data in an easily comprehensible
and reproducible manner. Utilizing the techniques and tools developed by Fulop
and Fitz, a variation of the reassigned spectrogram is proposed. Non-locally
Averaged Pruned Reassigned Spectrograms (NAPReS) provide a simplified view into
the characteristics of a speaker's glottal pulsation patterns throughout the
centroid of a vowel through the stacking, summing, and pruning of large numbers
of glottal pulses. In this exploratory study, NAPReS has been shown to display
a large amount of data in an easily comprehensible and quantifiable manner,
while also making the observation of low-amplitude cyclical structures more
accessible. NAPReS also allows for alternative formant fitting methods such as
Gaussian mixture modeling. In this study, NAPReS with GMM was compared against
conventional LPC fitting of formant values and was shown to be more
reproducible than conventional LPC fitting in high-noise situations.

Conclusion: 该方法为时间敏感无线网络中的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and timely image transmission is critical for emerging
time-sensitive applications such as remote sensing in satellite-assisted
Internet of Things. However, the bandwidth limitation poses a significant
challenge in existing wireless systems, making it difficult to fulfill the
requirements of both high-fidelity and low-latency image transmission. Semantic
communication is expected to break through the performance bottleneck by
focusing on the transmission of goal-oriented semantic information rather than
raw data. In this paper, we employ a new timeliness metric named the value of
information (VoI) and propose an adaptive joint source and channel coding
(JSCC) method for image transmission that simultaneously considers both
reconstruction quality and timeliness. Specifically, we first design a JSCC
framework for image transmission with adaptive code length. Next, we formulate
a VoI maximization problem by optimizing the transmission code length of the
adaptive JSCC under the reconstruction quality constraint. Then, a deep
reinforcement learning-based algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization
problem efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method
significantly outperforms baseline schemes in terms of reconstruction quality
and timeliness, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, offering
a promising solution for efficient and robust image transmission in
time-sensitive wireless networks.

Abstract: Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs) are recently attracting considerable
research interests due to their potential to enable low-cost, reconfigurable,
and highly scalable antenna array architectures for next generation wireless
systems. However, most of the existing literature relies on idealized models
for the DMA operation, often overlooking critical structural and physical
constraints inherent to their constituent metamaterials. In this paper,
leveraging a recently proposed model for this antenna architecture
incorporating physically consistent modeling of mutual coupling and waveguide
propagation losses, we optimize DMA-based transmission for bistatic sensing. A
tractable approximation for the DMA response is first presented, which enables
efficient optimization of the dynamically reconfigurable Lorentzian-constrained
responses of the array's metamaterials. In particular, we formulate a robust
beamforming optimization problem with the objective to minimize the worst-case
position error bound, in the presence of spatial uncertainties for the
environment's scatterers as well as synchronization uncertainties at the analog
combining multi-antenna receiver. To address the resulting high computational
complexity due to the possibly excessive number of metamaterial-based antennas
and their operation constraints, two low complexity beamforming design
approaches are presented that perform offline searching over a novel beam
codebook. The accuracy of all presented DMA designs is assessed by means of
Monte Carlo simulations for various system parameters, confirming that
accurately modeling mutual coupling is essential for maintaining increased
localization performance. It is also shown that, even under positioning and
synchronization uncertainties, the proposed designs yield accuracy comparable
to their fully digital and analog counterparts, while adhering to the
structural DMA constraints.

Abstract: This paper introduces Generalized Nonnegative Structured Kruskal Tensor
Regression (NS-KTR), a novel tensor regression framework that enhances
interpretability and performance through mode-specific hybrid regularization
and nonnegativity constraints. Our approach accommodates both linear and
logistic regression formulations for diverse response variables while
addressing the structural heterogeneity inherent in multidimensional tensor
data. We integrate fused LASSO, total variation, and ridge regularizers, each
tailored to specific tensor modes, and develop an efficient alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm for parameter
estimation. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic signals and real
hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that NS-KTR consistently outperforms
conventional tensor regression methods. The framework's ability to preserve
distinct structural characteristics across tensor dimensions while ensuring
physical interpretability makes it especially suitable for applications in
signal processing and hyperspectral image analysis.

Abstract: Conventional antenna arrays rely primarily on digital beamforming for spatial
control. While adding more elements can narrow beamwidth and suppress
interference, such scaling incurs prohibitive hardware and power costs.
Rotatable antennas (RAs), which allow mechanical or electronic adjustment of
element orientations, introduce a new degree of freedom to exploit spatial
flexibility without enlarging the array. By dynamically optimizing
orientations, RAs can substantially improve desired link alignment and
interference suppression. This paper investigates RA-enabled multiple-input
single-output (MISO) interference channels under co-channel spectrum sharing
and formulates a weighted sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes
transmit beamforming and antenna orientations. To tackle this nonconvex
problem, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) framework that integrates
weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based beamforming with
Frank-Wolfe-based orientation updates. To reduce complexity, we further study
orientation optimization under maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and
zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming schemes. For finite-resolution actuators, we
construct spherical Fibonacci codebooks and design a cross-entropy method
(CEM)-based algorithm for discrete orientation selection. Simulations show that
integrating RAs with conventional beamforming markedly increases weighted
sum-rate, with gains rising with element directivity. Under discrete
orientation control, the proposed CEM algorithm consistently outperforms the
nearest-projection baseline.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在计算效率上具有显著优势，适用于需要快速时间差估计的应用场景。

Abstract: We present a theorem concerning the invariance of cross-correlation peak
positions, which provides a foundation for a new method for time difference
estimation that is potentially faster than the conventional fast Fourier
transform (FFT) approach for real/complex sequences. This theoretical result
shows that the peak position of the cross-correlation function between two
shifted discrete-time signals remains unchanged under arbitrary monotonic
transformations of the input signals. By exploiting this property, we design an
efficient estimation algorithm based on the cross-correlation function between
signals quantized into low-bit integers. The proposed method requires only
integer arithmetic instead of real-valued operations, and further computational
efficiency can be achieved through number-theoretic algorithms. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a shorter processing
time than conventional FFT-based approaches.

Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems are
pivotal to next-generation wireless communications, where dynamic RF chain
architectures offer enhanced performance. However, efficient precoding in such
systems requires accurate channel state information (CSI) obtained with low
complexity. To address this challenge, spatial-domain channel extrapolation has
attracted growing interest. Existing methods often overlook near-field
spherical wavefronts or rely heavily on sparsity priors, leading to performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose an adaptive near-field channel
extrapolation framework for multi-subcarrier XL-MIMO systems, leveraging a
strategically selected subset of antennas. Subsequently, we develop both
on-grid and off-grid algorithms, where the latter refines the former's
estimates for improved accuracy. To further reduce complexity, a
cross-validation (CV)-based scheme is introduced. Additionally, we analytically
formulate the mutual coherence of the sensing matrix and propose a
coherence-minimizing-based random pattern to ensure robust extrapolation.
Numerical results validate that the proposed algorithms significantly
outperform existing methods in both extrapolation accuracy and achievable rate,
while maintaining low computational complexity. In particular, our proposed CV
ratio offers a flexible trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and the
corresponding off-grid algorithm achieves high accuracy with complexity
comparable to conventional on-grid methods.

Conclusion: 量子接收器能显著提升CV-QKD在湍流信道中的性能，Type-II接收器尤其适合恶劣环境。

Abstract: Continuous variable-quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols attract
increasing attentions in recent years because they enjoy high secret key rate
(SKR) and good compatibility with existing optical communication
infrastructure. Classical coherent receivers are widely employed in coherent
states based CV-QKD protocols, whose detection performance is bounded by the
standard quantum limit (SQL). Recently, quantum receivers based on displacement
operators are experimentally demonstrated with detection performance
outperforming the SQL in various practical conditions. However, potential
applications of quantum receivers in CV-QKD protocols under turbulent channels
are still not well explored, while practical CV-QKD protocols must survive from
the atmospheric turbulence in satellite-to-ground optical communication links.
In this paper, we consider the possibility of using a quantum receiver called
multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the SKR performance of a quadrature
phase shift keying (QPSK) modulated CV-QKD protocol in turbulent channels. We
first derive the error probability of the multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver for
detecting QPSK signals in turbulent channels and further propose three types of
multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver with different displacement choices, i.e., the
Type-I, Type-II, and Type-III receivers. Then we derive the SKR of a QPSK
modulated CV-QKD protocol using the multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver and
post-selection strategy in turbulent channels. Numerical results show that the
multi-stage CD-Kennedy receiver can outperform the classical coherent receiver
in turbulent channels in terms of both error probability and SKR performance
and the Type-II receiver can tolerate worse channel conditions compared with
Type-I and Type-III receivers in terms of error probability performance.

Abstract: During an epidemic outbreak, decision makers crucially need accurate and
robust tools to monitor the pathogen propagation. The effective reproduction
number, defined as the expected number of secondary infections stemming from
one contaminated individual, is a state-of-the-art indicator quantifying the
epidemic intensity. Numerous estimators have been developed to precisely track
the reproduction number temporal evolution. Yet, COVID-19 pandemic surveillance
raised unprecedented challenges due to the poor quality of worldwide reported
infection counts. When monitoring the epidemic in different territories
simultaneously, leveraging the spatial structure of data significantly enhances
both the accuracy and robustness of reproduction number estimates. However,
this requires a good estimate of the spatial structure. To tackle this major
limitation, the present work proposes a joint estimator of the reproduction
number and connectivity structure. The procedure is assessed through intensive
numerical simulations on carefully designed synthetic data and illustrated on
real COVID-19 spatiotemporal infection counts.

Abstract: Optical fibers have long been employed as sensors in a wide range of
commercial systems. Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) extends this concept by
enabling the detection and localization of acoustic sources along the fiber,
using backscattered light from small segments to achieve spatial resolution on
the order of meters. Recently, DAS has also been explored as a component in
underwater acoustic communication systems. Emerging interest in bidirectional
configurations where both transmitter and receiver are placed at opposite ends
of the fiber has opened new possibilities. However, in such setups, source
localization is not inherently integrated into the signal decoding process. For
scenarios where source positioning is valuable, we propose an approach inspired
by bi-static radar principles. This configuration utilizes acoustic signals
received at both ends of the fiber to estimate source position based on
propagation delay differences. Although the localization accuracy is lower than
that of DAS due to reduced sampling rates, the method offers a viable
alternative for integrated communication and positioning. We present the system
topology and configuration for a dual-fiber layout, each end equipped with
optical transmitters and receivers. The position estimation is derived from the
time difference of arrival (TDOA) between the two receivers. The Cram\'er-Rao
Bound is derived to characterize the theoretical limits of localization
accuracy, highlighting dependencies on system parameters such as optical power
loss. Our analysis shows that increased acoustic bandwidth and higher carrier
frequencies enhance spatial resolution. We formulate the Cross Ambiguity
Function as a maximum likelihood estimator for TDOA and provide simulation
results illustrating its performance under varying system conditions. Finally,
we discuss key challenges that must be addressed for practical implementation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-accuracy radio map construction method tailored
for environments where location information is affected by bursty errors. Radio
maps are an effective tool for visualizing wireless environments. Although
extensive research has been conducted on accurate radio map construction, most
existing approaches assume noise-free location information during sensing. In
practice, however, positioning errors ranging from a few to several tens of
meters can arise due to device-based positioning systems (e.g., GNSS). Ignoring
such errors during inference can lead to significant degradation in radio map
accuracy. This study highlights that these errors often tend to be biased when
using mobile devices as sensors. We introduce a novel framework that models
these errors together with spatial correlation in radio propagation by
embedding them as tunable parameters in the marginal log-likelihood function.
This enables ex-post calibration of location uncertainty during radio map
construction. Numerical results based on practical human mobility data
demonstrate that the proposed method can limit RMSE degradation to
approximately 0.25-0.29 dB, compared with Gaussian process regression using
noise-free location data, whereas baseline methods suffer performance losses
exceeding 1 dB.

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) are emerging as
a transformative technology in wireless communications, enabling enhanced
performance and quality of service (QoS) of wireless systems in harsh urban
environments due to their relatively low cost and advanced signal processing
capabilities. Generally, BD-RIS systems are employed to improve robustness,
increase achievable rates, and enhance energy efficiency of wireless systems in
both direct and indirect ways. The direct way is to produce a favorable
propagation environment via the design of optimized scattering matrices, while
the indirect way is to reap additional improvements via the design of
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamformers that further exploit the
latter "engineered" medium. In this article, the problem of sum-rate
maximization via BD-RIS is examined, with a focus on feasibility, namely
low-complexity physical implementation, by enforcing reciprocity in the BD-RIS
design. We begin by outlining the system model and formulating an optimization
problem that aims to enhance the system's sum-rate by designing a symmetric
scattering matrix. In particular, the approach leverages a manifold
optimization framework, where a penalty term is added to the objective function
to ensure that the symmetry constraint is upheld, with reciprocity further

matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出两种自适应单射频端口选择方案（EOHS和PCA），以优化CUMA技术的性能，显著提升信号干扰比（SIR），同时保持低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUMA技术虽然通过随机信道叠加抑制用户间干扰且硬件成本低，但其临时端口选择策略仍有优化空间，需改进以支持大规模用户场景。

Method: 提出两种端口选择方案：1）EOHS动态选择最优投影方向以最大化信号；2）PCA通过主成分分析降低复杂度，并提供闭式解和分析框架。

Result: 仿真表明，EOHS和PCA在性能上均优于传统CUMA，PCA在低计算成本下接近EOHS性能，适应大规模用户需求。

Conclusion: 两种方案有效平衡复杂度与性能，为下一代多址系统提供优化方案，尤其是PCA在大规模场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Compact ultra-massive antenna-array (CUMA) is a novel multiple access
technology built on the fluid antenna system (FAS) concept, offering an
improved scheme over fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) that can support
massive connectivity on the same physical channel without the need of precoding
and interference cancellation. By employing a simple port-selection mechanism
that leverages random channel superposition, CUMA can suppress inter-user
interference while keeping hardware costs low. Nevertheless, its ad-hoc
port-selection strategy leaves considerable room for optimization. In this
work, we revisit CUMA and propose two adaptive single-RF port-selection schemes
that retain its simplicity while significantly enhancing performance. The first
one, referred to as exact optimal half-space (EOHS), dynamically selects the
projection direction that maximizes the instantaneous signal build-up across
active ports. To reduce complexity while preserving most of the gains, we
furthermore introduce a principal component analysis (PCA)-based scheme, which
aligns port partitioning with the dominant statistical direction of per-port
channel vectors. This method yields a closed-form low-complexity solution,
complemented by a tractable analytical framework that provides a closed-form
expression for the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) probability density
function (PDF). Simulation results corroborate the analysis, demonstrating that
both EOHS and PCA consistently outperform conventional CUMA across diverse user
densities, port counts, and FAS aperture sizes. Notably, PCA achieves
performance close to EOHS at a fraction of the computational cost. The proposed
schemes scale effectively to large-user regimes, offering a compelling
complexity-performance trade-off for next-generation multiple access systems.

*Alessandro Saviolo,Jeffrey Mao,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HUNT框架通过实时统一搜索、捕获和跟踪任务，利用机载瞬时观测数据实现高速飞行，成功在复杂环境中展示了自主性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机在未知无结构环境中高速导航和目标跟踪的双重挑战，特别是在感知退化和无全局定位的情况下。

Method: 提出HUNT框架，直接基于机载瞬时观测数据（如姿态、高度、速度）定义导航目标，实现搜索和跟踪的无缝切换。

Result: 在密集森林、集装箱区域和搜救任务中成功验证了HUNT的鲁棒性，优于传统全局方法。

Conclusion: HUNT框架在复杂环境中实现了高效且鲁棒的无人机导航和跟踪能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Search and rescue operations require unmanned aerial vehicles to both
traverse unknown unstructured environments at high speed and track targets once
detected. Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global
localization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation
have shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible
detected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field
of view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time
framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single
relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard
instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling
reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same
perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking. Outdoor
experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue
operations with vehicles and mannequins demonstrate robust autonomy where
global methods fail.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ROPA的方法，通过微调Stable Diffusion合成第三人称RGB和RGB-D图像及动作标签，用于增强双边操控的数据多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界双边操控演示数据收集成本高且耗时，限制了规模扩展，现有数据增强方法多针对手腕摄像头或RGB输入，缺乏对第三人称RGB-D数据的探索。

Method: ROPA方法利用Stable Diffusion合成新机器人姿态的RGB/RGB-D图像，同时生成对应的动作标签，并通过约束优化确保物理一致性。

Result: 在5个模拟任务和3个真实任务中，ROPA在2625次模拟实验和300次真实实验中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ROPA展示了在第三人称双边操控中用于RGB和RGB-D数据规模扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning
requires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and
scene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world
demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior
works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either
eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel
images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand
(third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this
paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data
Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method
that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D
observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates
corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained
optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate
gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our
method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625
simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms
baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data
augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation. Our project website is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模仿学习中专家演示数据收集成本高且费力的问题，实现少样本下的高效学习。

Method: SEIL框架通过模拟器生成成功轨迹作为新演示，并采用双层次增广（模型级和环境级）及轨迹选择器提升演示多样性。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，SEIL在少样本模仿学习场景下实现了新SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SEIL框架通过自生成高质量演示，显著减少了对专家数据的依赖，为模仿学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Imitation learning has been a trend recently, yet training a generalist agent
across multiple tasks still requires large-scale expert demonstrations, which
are costly and labor-intensive to collect. To address the challenge of limited
supervision, we propose Self-Evolved Imitation Learning (SEIL), a framework
that progressively improves a few-shot model through simulator interactions.
The model first attempts tasksin the simulator, from which successful
trajectories are collected as new demonstrations for iterative refinement. To
enhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level
augmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model
to collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing
slight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a
lightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories
from the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples
enable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training
examples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves
a new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CU-Multi数据集，旨在解决多机器人系统中数据集匮乏和标准化不足的问题，为协作感知任务提供可重复评估的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机器人系统的协作感知数据融合缺乏标准化且有效的基准数据集，现有数据集多为单机器人轨迹分割或轨迹短、重叠少。

Method: 通过在科罗拉多大学博尔德分校两个大型户外场地收集多日数据，创建了CU-Multi数据集，包含四种同步运行、轨迹重叠控制的数据，并提供RGB-D、GPS、LiDAR等多模态感知数据。

Result: CU-Multi数据集提供了丰富的轨迹重叠变化和语义标注，支持多机器人协作感知任务的标准化评估。

Conclusion: CU-Multi填补了多机器人数据集领域的空白，为未来研究提供了可比较和可重复的实验基础。

Abstract: A central challenge for multi-robot systems is fusing independently gathered
perception data into a unified representation. Despite progress in
Collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM), benchmarking remains hindered by the scarcity of
dedicated multi-robot datasets. Many evaluations instead partition single-robot
trajectories, a practice that may only partially reflect true multi-robot
operations and, more critically, lacks standardization, leading to results that
are difficult to interpret or compare across studies. While several multi-robot
datasets have recently been introduced, they mostly contain short trajectories
with limited inter-robot overlap and sparse intra-robot loop closures. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CU-Multi, a dataset collected over
multiple days at two large outdoor sites on the University of Colorado Boulder
campus. CU-Multi comprises four synchronized runs with aligned start times and
controlled trajectory overlap, replicating the distinct perspectives of a robot
team. It includes RGB-D sensing, RTK GPS, semantic LiDAR, and refined
ground-truth odometry. By combining overlap variation with dense semantic
annotations, CU-Multi provides a strong foundation for reproducible evaluation
in multi-robot collaborative perception tasks.

Motivation: 月球阴影区水冰资源对火星任务至关重要，但现有探测技术难以胜任。

Conclusion: COBRA为解决月球探测难题提供了创新方案，支持未来深空任务。

Abstract: NASA aims to establish a sustainable human basecamp on the Moon as a stepping
stone for future missions to Mars and beyond. The discovery of water ice on the
Moon's craters located in permanently shadowed regions, which can provide
drinking water, oxygen, and rocket fuel, is therefore of critical importance.
However, current methods to access lunar ice deposits are limited. While rovers
have been used to explore the lunar surface for decades, they face significant
challenges in navigating harsh terrains, such as permanently shadowed craters,
due to the high risk of immobilization. This report introduces COBRA (Crater
Observing Bio-inspired Rolling Articulator), a multi-modal snake-style robot
designed to overcome mobility challenges in Shackleton Crater's rugged
environment. COBRA combines slithering and tumbling locomotion to adapt to
various crater terrains. In snake mode, it uses sidewinding to traverse flat or
low inclined surfaces, while in tumbling mode, it forms a circular barrel by
linking its head and tail, enabling rapid movement with minimal energy on steep
slopes. Equipped with an onboard computer, stereo camera, inertial measurement
unit, and joint encoders, COBRA facilitates real-time data collection and
autonomous operation. This paper highlights COBRAs robustness and efficiency in
navigating extreme terrains through both simulations and experimental
validation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OmniVLA的训练框架，通过多模态目标条件化提升机器人导航策略的适应性，结合语言、空间坐标和视觉参考等多种目标指定方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人导航策略通常针对单一模态训练，限制了其在多样化现实场景中的适应性。为解决这一问题，研究团队提出了一种多模态目标条件化的训练框架。

Method: 采用高容量的视觉-语言-动作（VLA）主干，结合2D姿态、第一视角图像和自然语言三种主要模态，通过随机模态融合策略进行训练。

Result: 模型OmniVLA在未见过的环境中表现出强泛化能力，对稀缺模态的鲁棒性，并能遵循新的自然语言指令。其在各模态上的表现均优于专用基线模型。

Conclusion: OmniVLA为构建通用的、灵活的导航策略和可扩展的多模态机器人基础模型提供了重要一步。

Abstract: Humans can flexibly interpret and compose different goal specifications, such
as language instructions, spatial coordinates, or visual references, when
navigating to a destination. In contrast, most existing robotic navigation
policies are trained on a single modality, limiting their adaptability to
real-world scenarios where different forms of goal specification are natural
and complementary. In this work, we present a training framework for robotic
foundation models that enables omni-modal goal conditioning for vision-based
navigation. Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA)
backbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric
images, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a
randomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of
usable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric,
semantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves
strong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities,
and the ability to follow novel natural language instructions. We demonstrate
that OmniVLA outperforms specialist baselines across modalities and offers a
flexible foundation for fine-tuning to new modalities and tasks. We believe
OmniVLA provides a step toward broadly generalizable and flexible navigation
policies, and a scalable path for building omni-modal robotic foundation
models. We present videos showcasing OmniVLA performance and will release its
checkpoints and training code on our project page.

TL;DR: SHARP研究展示了高性能计算（HPC）如何实现机器人控制的毫秒级响应，通过在远程和本地HPC集群上进行并行化轨迹规划，证明了HPC卸载对实时机器人控制的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器人在人机共享工作空间中需要更高的反应速度，但由于尺寸、功耗和成本限制，无法依赖机载处理器实现。HPC卸载提供了潜在的解决方案，但其在实时机器人应用中的可行性尚不明确。

Method: 采用并行化的多目标A*搜索算法，通过MPI在本地和远程HPC集群上实现轨迹规划，评估系统在高压力避障场景中的表现。

Result: 在避障测试中，本地和远程HPC的规划延迟分别为22.9毫秒和30.0毫秒，避障成功率分别为84%和88%。结果表明，当网络延迟在几十毫秒内时，HPC不再是性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: SHARP证明了HPC卸载在动态环境中实现可靠、高反应速度机器人的可行性，并提出了混合控制架构的潜在应用前景。

Abstract: This paper presents SHARP (Supercomputing for High-speed Avoidance and
Reactive Planning), a proof-of-concept study demonstrating how high-performance
computing (HPC) can enable millisecond-scale responsiveness in robotic control.
While modern robots face increasing demands for reactivity in human--robot
shared workspaces, onboard processors are constrained by size, power, and cost.
Offloading to HPC offers massive parallelism for trajectory planning, but its
feasibility for real-time robotics remains uncertain due to network latency and
jitter. We evaluate SHARP in a stress-test scenario where a 7-DOF manipulator
must dodge high-speed foam projectiles. Using a parallelized multi-goal A*
search implemented with MPI on both local and remote HPC clusters, the system
achieves mean planning latencies of 22.9 ms (local) and 30.0 ms (remote, ~300
km away), with avoidance success rates of 84% and 88%, respectively. These
results show that when round-trip latency remains within the
tens-of-milliseconds regime, HPC-side computation is no longer the bottleneck,
enabling avoidance well below human reaction times. The SHARP results motivate
hybrid control architectures: low-level reflexes remain onboard for safety,
while bursty, high-throughput planning tasks are offloaded to HPC for
scalability. By reporting per-stage timing and success rates, this study
provides a reproducible template for assessing real-time feasibility of
HPC-driven robotics. Collectively, SHARP reframes HPC offloading as a viable
pathway toward dependable, reactive robots in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Gesture-based control for mobile manipulators faces persistent challenges in
reliability, efficiency, and intuitiveness. This paper presents a dual-hand
gesture interface that integrates TinyML, spectral analysis, and sensor fusion
within a ROS framework to address these limitations. The system uses left-hand
tilt and finger flexion, captured using accelerometer and flex sensors, for
mobile base navigation, while right-hand IMU signals are processed through
spectral analysis and classified by a lightweight neural network. This pipeline
enables TinyML-based gesture recognition to control a 7-DOF Kinova Gen3
manipulator. By supporting simultaneous navigation and manipulation, the
framework improves efficiency and coordination compared to sequential methods.
Key contributions include a bimanual control architecture, real-time low-power
gesture recognition, robust multimodal sensor fusion, and a scalable ROS-based
implementation. The proposed approach advances Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
for industrial automation, assistive robotics, and hazardous environments,
offering a cost-effective, open-source solution with strong potential for
real-world deployment and further optimization.

Motivation: 软机器人控制因非线性响应、滞后效应和大变形等问题而面临挑战。传统方法难以有效利用软机器人的配置空间，而基于强化学习的方法则受限于样本效率和初始化不一致性。本文旨在通过RL实现实时单次硬件部署的可靠控制策略学习。

Conclusion: 单次学习在硬件上的实现为软机器人在真实世界中可靠学习提供了可能，将推动更多样化和能力更强的软机器人系统的开发。

Abstract: Closed-loop control remains an open challenge in soft robotics. The nonlinear
responses of soft actuators under dynamic loading conditions limit the use of
analytic models for soft robot control. Traditional methods of controlling soft
robots underutilize their configuration spaces to avoid nonlinearity,
hysteresis, large deformations, and the risk of actuator damage. Furthermore,
episodic data-driven control approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL) are
traditionally limited by sample efficiency and inconsistency across
initializations. In this work, we demonstrate RL for reliably learning control
policies for dynamic balancing tasks in real-time single-shot hardware
deployments. We use a deformable Stewart platform constructed using parallel,
3D-printed soft actuators based on motorized handed shearing auxetic (HSA)
structures. By introducing a curriculum learning approach based on expanding
neighborhoods of a known equilibrium, we achieve reliable single-deployment
balancing at arbitrary coordinates. In addition to benchmarking the performance
of model-based and model-free methods, we demonstrate that in a single
deployment, Maximum Diffusion RL is capable of learning dynamic balancing after
half of the actuators are effectively disabled, by inducing buckling and by
breaking actuators with bolt cutters. Training occurs with no prior data, in as
fast as 15 minutes, with performance nearly identical to the fully-intact
platform. Single-shot learning on hardware facilitates soft robotic systems
reliably learning in the real world and will enable more diverse and capable
soft robots.

Conclusion: 自动化LIBS扫描能够补充野外测量，连接锂基电池材料供应链中的资源勘探和处理步骤。

Abstract: Despite the rapidly growing applications of robots in industry, the use of
robots to automate tasks in scientific laboratories is less prolific due to
lack of generalized methodologies and high cost of hardware. This paper focuses
on the automation of characterization tasks necessary for reducing cost while
maintaining generalization, and proposes a software architecture for building
robotic systems in scientific laboratory environment. A dual-layer (Socket.IO
and ROS) action server design is the basic building block, which facilitates
the implementation of a web-based front end for user-friendly operations and
the use of ROS Behavior Tree for convenient task planning and execution. A
robotic platform for automating mineral and material sample characterization is
built upon the architecture, with an open source, low-cost three-axis computer
numerical control gantry system serving as the main robot. A handheld laser
induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analyzer is integrated with a 3D printed
adapter, enabling automated 2D chemical mapping. We demonstrate the utility of
automated chemical mapping by scanning of the surface of a spodumene-bearing
pegmatite core sample with a 1071-point dense hyperspectral map acquired at a
rate of 1520 bits per second. Automated LIBS scanning enables controlled
chemical quantification in the laboratory that complements field-based
measurements acquired with the same handheld device, linking resource
exploration and processing steps in the supply chain for lithium-based battery
materials.

Motivation: 现有潜在安全过滤器假设安全约束预先已知且固定，限制了其适应性。为此，作者希望通过图像编码和潜在空间相似性度量实现运行时约束调整。

Method: 提出约束参数化的潜在安全过滤器，利用图像编码表示安全约束，通过一致校准对齐相似性度量。训练完全在世界模型的想象空间中进行。

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验（如Franka机械臂的视觉控制任务）中，该方法能在运行时适应不同约束，且不影响性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过运行时约束调整增强了安全过滤器的适应性，适用于多样化的真实场景。

Abstract: Recent works have shown that foundational safe control methods, such as
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, can be applied in the latent space
of world models. While this enables the synthesis of latent safety filters for
hard-to-model vision-based tasks, they assume that the safety constraint is
known a priori and remains fixed during deployment, limiting the safety
filter's adaptability across scenarios. To address this, we propose
constraint-parameterized latent safety filters that can adapt to user-specified
safety constraints at runtime. Our key idea is to define safety constraints by
conditioning on an encoding of an image that represents a constraint, using a
latent-space similarity measure. The notion of similarity to failure is aligned
in a principled way through conformal calibration, which controls how closely
the system may approach the constraint representation. The parameterized safety
filter is trained entirely within the world model's imagination, treating any
image seen by the model as a potential test-time constraint, thereby enabling
runtime adaptation to arbitrary safety constraints. In simulation and hardware
experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show
that our method adapts at runtime by conditioning on the encoding of
user-specified constraint images, without sacrificing performance. Video

Abstract: Executing open-ended natural language queries is a core problem in robotics.
While recent advances in imitation learning and vision-language-actions models
(VLAs) have enabled promising end-to-end policies, these models struggle when
faced with complex instructions and new scenes. An alternative is to design an
explicit scene representation as a queryable interface between the robot and
the world, using query results to guide downstream motion planning. In this
work, we present Agentic Scene Policies (ASP), an agentic framework that
leverages the advanced semantic, spatial, and affordance-based querying
capabilities of modern scene representations to implement a capable
language-conditioned robot policy. ASP can execute open-vocabulary queries in a
zero-shot manner by explicitly reasoning about object affordances in the case
of more complex skills. Through extensive experiments, we compare ASP with VLAs
on tabletop manipulation problems and showcase how ASP can tackle room-level
queries through affordance-guided navigation, and a scaled-up scene
representation. (Project page:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合非线性控制理论和强化学习的方法（CLF-RL），用于设计人形机器人的高动态行为控制器，避免手工调整奖励函数，同时确保稳定性和动态可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计人形机器人的高动态行为（如跑步）控制器需要兼顾鲁棒性和精确性，传统方法难以处理非线性和混合动力学问题，而强化学习虽受欢迎但缺乏稳定性保证和有效的学习引导。

Method: 论文提出CLF-RL方法，将控制李雅普诺夫函数（CLFs）和优化的动态参考轨迹嵌入强化学习训练中，以自然生成奖励函数，避免手工调整。

Result: CLF-RL方法成功实现机器人在跑步机及户外环境中的稳定跑步，包括飞行和单支撑阶段，并展示了对外部干扰的鲁棒性。仅通过机载传感器即可实现精确的全局参考跟踪。

Conclusion: CLF-RL方法为高动态行为控制提供了一种稳定性可验证且无需手工设计奖励的有效方案，为机器人自主系统中的动态运动集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Achieving highly dynamic behaviors on humanoid robots, such as running,
requires controllers that are both robust and precise, and hence difficult to
design. Classical control methods offer valuable insight into how such systems
can stabilize themselves, but synthesizing real-time controllers for nonlinear
and hybrid dynamics remains challenging. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)
has gained popularity for locomotion control due to its ability to handle these
complex dynamics. In this work, we embed ideas from nonlinear control theory,
specifically control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), along with optimized dynamic
reference trajectories into the reinforcement learning training process to
shape the reward. This approach, CLF-RL, eliminates the need to handcraft and
tune heuristic reward terms, while simultaneously encouraging certifiable
stability and providing meaningful intermediate rewards to guide learning. By
grounding policy learning in dynamically feasible trajectories, we expand the
robot's dynamic capabilities and enable running that includes both flight and
single support phases. The resulting policy operates reliably on a treadmill
and in outdoor environments, demonstrating robustness to disturbances applied
to the torso and feet. Moreover, it achieves accurate global reference tracking
utilizing only on-board sensors, making a critical step toward integrating
these dynamic motions into a full autonomy stack.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合室内3D场景图技术和户外几何地图的地形感知3D场景图方法，用于提升户外自主机器人的语义理解和任务规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统几何地图缺乏语义理解，限制了机器人的高级推理能力。3D场景图通过整合几何、拓扑和语义关系，提供了更丰富的环境表达，但户外场景还需结合地形信息。

Method: 结合室内3DSG技术和户外几何地图，生成地形感知的地点节点和分层区域组织，构建轻量级3DSG用于下游规划任务。

Result: 生成的3DSG在物体检索上与现有方法相当，在区域分类中表现更好，并且内存效率更高。在模拟和真实环境中验证了其在物体检索和区域监测任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文的方法有效提升了户外机器人的语义理解和规划能力，同时保持了轻量化和高效性。

Abstract: Outdoor intelligent autonomous robotic operation relies on a sufficiently
expressive map of the environment. Classical geometric mapping methods retain
essential structural environment information, but lack a semantic understanding
and organization to allow high-level robotic reasoning. 3D scene graphs (3DSGs)
address this limitation by integrating geometric, topological, and semantic
relationships into a multi-level graph-based map. Outdoor autonomous operations
commonly rely on terrain information either due to task-dependence or the
traversability of the robotic platform. We propose a novel approach that
combines indoor 3DSG techniques with standard outdoor geometric mapping and
terrain-aware reasoning, producing terrain-aware place nodes and hierarchically
organized regions for outdoor environments. Our method generates a
task-agnostic metric-semantic sparse map and constructs a 3DSG from this map
for downstream planning tasks, all while remaining lightweight for autonomous
robotic operation. Our thorough evaluation demonstrates our 3DSG method
performs on par with state-of-the-art camera-based 3DSG methods in object
retrieval and surpasses them in region classification while remaining memory
efficient. We demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse robotic tasks of object
retrieval and region monitoring in both simulation and real-world environments.

Method: 提出 SPACE2TIME 方法，通过将空间扰动的变化重新参数化为时间变化，利用离线学习的值函数在线操作。

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中验证了 SPACE2TIME 的显著改进，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SPACE2TIME 为高维系统在未知扰动下的安全部署提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of autonomous systems in safety-critical
environments such as urban air mobility hinges on ensuring reliable,
performant, and safe operation under varying environmental conditions. One such
approach, value function-based safety filters, minimally modifies a nominal
controller to ensure safety. Recent advances leverage offline learned value
functions to scale these safety filters to high-dimensional systems. However,
these methods assume detailed priors on all possible sources of model mismatch,
in the form of disturbances in the environment -- information that is rarely
available in real world settings. Even in well-mapped environments like urban
canyons or industrial sites, drones encounter complex, spatially-varying
disturbances arising from payload-drone interaction, turbulent airflow, and
other environmental factors. We introduce SPACE2TIME, which enables safe and
adaptive deployment of offline-learned safety filters under unknown,
spatially-varying disturbances. The key idea is to reparameterize spatial
variations in disturbance as temporal variations, enabling the use of
precomputed value functions during online operation. We validate SPACE2TIME on
a quadcopter through extensive simulations and hardware experiments,
demonstrating significant improvement over baselines.

Result: 在高自由度机器人上验证，PS-PRM在静态和动态环境中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PS-PRM有效解决了动态环境中高自由度机器人运动规划与感知任务的冲突问题。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of planning robot motions for a
high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robot that effectively achieves a given perception
task while the robot and the perception target move in a dynamic environment.
Achieving navigation and perception tasks simultaneously is challenging, as
these objectives often impose conflicting requirements. Existing methods that
compute motion under perception constraints fail to account for obstacles, are
designed for low-DoF robots, or rely on simplified models of perception.
Furthermore, in dynamic real-world environments, robots must replan and react
quickly to changes and directly evaluating the quality of perception (e.g.,
object detection confidence) is often expensive or infeasible at runtime. This
problem is especially important in human-centered environments such as homes
and hospitals, where effective perception is essential for safe and reliable
operation. To address these challenges, we propose a GPU-parallelized
perception-score-guided probabilistic roadmap planner with a neural surrogate
model (PS-PRM). The planner explicitly incorporates the estimated quality of a
perception task into motion planning for high-DoF robots. Our method uses a
learned model to approximate perception scores and leverages GPU parallelism to
enable efficient online replanning in dynamic settings. We demonstrate that our
planner, evaluated on high-DoF robots, outperforms baseline methods in both
static and dynamic environments in both simulation and real-robot experiments.

Abstract: Egocentric human experience data presents a vast resource for scaling up
end-to-end imitation learning for robotic manipulation. However, significant
domain gaps in visual appearance, sensor modalities, and kinematics between
human and robot impede knowledge transfer. This paper presents EgoBridge, a
unified co-training framework that explicitly aligns the policy latent spaces
between human and robot data using domain adaptation. Through a measure of
discrepancy on the joint policy latent features and actions based on Optimal
Transport (OT), we learn observation representations that not only align
between the human and robot domain but also preserve the action-relevant
information critical for policy learning. EgoBridge achieves a significant
absolute policy success rate improvement by 44% over human-augmented
cross-embodiment baselines in three real-world single-arm and bimanual
manipulation tasks. EgoBridge also generalizes to new objects, scenes, and
tasks seen only in human data, where baselines fail entirely. Videos and

Abstract: Autonomous racing has seen significant advancements, driven by competitions
such as the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) and the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing
League (A2RL). However, developing an autonomous racing stack for a full-scale
car is often constrained by limited access to dedicated test tracks,
restricting opportunities for real-world validation. While previous work
typically requires extended development cycles and significant track time, this
paper introduces a minimalistic autonomous racing stack for high-speed
time-trial racing that emphasizes rapid deployment and efficient system
integration with minimal on-track testing. The proposed stack was validated on
real speedways, achieving a top speed of 206 km/h within just 11 hours'
practice run on the track with 325 km in total. Additionally, we present the
system performance analysis, including tracking accuracy, vehicle dynamics, and
safety considerations, offering insights for teams seeking to rapidly develop
and deploy an autonomous racing stack with limited track access.

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，RoboSSM在未见任务上表现优异且在长时任务中保持稳健。

Conclusion: SSM作为一种高效可扩展的框架，展示了在上下文模仿学习中的潜力。

Abstract: In-context imitation learning (ICIL) enables robots to learn tasks from
prompts consisting of just a handful of demonstrations. By eliminating the need
for parameter updates at deployment time, this paradigm supports few-shot
adaptation to novel tasks. However, recent ICIL methods rely on Transformers,
which have computational limitations and tend to underperform when handling
longer prompts than those seen during training. In this work, we introduce
RoboSSM, a scalable recipe for in-context imitation learning based on
state-space models (SSM). Specifically, RoboSSM replaces Transformers with
Longhorn -- a state-of-the-art SSM that provides linear-time inference and
strong extrapolation capabilities, making it well-suited for long-context
prompts. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark and compare it
against strong Transformer-based ICIL baselines. Experiments show that RoboSSM
extrapolates effectively to varying numbers of in-context demonstrations,
yields high performance on unseen tasks, and remains robust in long-horizon
scenarios. These results highlight the potential of SSMs as an efficient and
scalable backbone for ICIL. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架为控制系统（尤其是机器人动力学）提供了一种通用的经验学习方法，增强了其在复杂状态空间中的导航能力，无需领域专业知识或大量离线训练。

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control methods often struggle in complex non-convex
landscapes, frequently becoming trapped in local optima due to their inability
to learn from historical trajectory data. This paper introduces
Memory-Augmented Potential Field Theory, a unified mathematical framework that
integrates historical experience into stochastic optimal control. Our approach
dynamically constructs memory-based potential fields that identify and encode
key topological features of the state space, enabling controllers to
automatically learn from past experiences and adapt their optimization
strategy. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that memory-augmented
potential fields possess non-convex escape properties, asymptotic convergence
characteristics, and computational efficiency. We implement this theoretical
framework in a Memory-Augmented Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
controller that demonstrates significantly improved performance in challenging
non-convex environments. The framework represents a generalizable approach to
experience-based learning within control systems (especially robotic dynamics),
enhancing their ability to navigate complex state spaces without requiring
specialized domain knowledge or extensive offline training.

Conclusion: 该方法在不需重新训练的情况下提升了GMPs的安全性和动态可行性，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based
generative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages
over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of
their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale
only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve
GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate
the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural
tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This
yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the
controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a
library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that
imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving
safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including
diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in
simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware
(differential-drive robot).

Abstract: Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are
not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance
Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting
feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a
framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with
cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force
Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space
behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise
scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then
passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping
parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task
axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were
collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using
teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples,
the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational
accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and
autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller
achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30
success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any
peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the
Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision
Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an
important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical
interaction with learning-based methods for trajectory generation.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation tasks involving cutting deformable objects remain
challenging due to complex topological behaviors, difficulties in perceiving
dense object states, and the lack of efficient evaluation methods for cutting
outcomes. In this paper, we introduce TopoCut, a comprehensive benchmark for
multi-step robotic cutting tasks that integrates a cutting environment and
generalized policy learning. TopoCut is built upon three core components: (1)
We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment based on a particle-based
elastoplastic solver with compliant von Mises constitutive models, augmented by
a novel damage-driven topology discovery mechanism that enables accurate
tracking of multiple cutting pieces. (2) We develop a comprehensive reward
design that integrates the topology discovery with a pose-invariant spectral
reward model based on Laplace-Beltrami eigenanalysis, facilitating consistent
and robust assessment of cutting quality. (3) We propose an integrated policy
learning pipeline, where a dynamics-informed perception module predicts
topological evolution and produces particle-wise, topology-aware embeddings to
support PDDP (Particle-based Score-Entropy Discrete Diffusion Policy) for
goal-conditioned policy learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TopoCut supports trajectory generation, scalable learning, precise evaluation,
and strong generalization across diverse object geometries, scales, poses, and
cutting goals.

Result: ThERMO将切割成功率提升三倍，峰值切割力降低一半，并能适应环境干扰，避免恒速方法的灾难性失败。

Conclusion: ThERMO通过智能速度控制显著提升电手术的安全性和效率，适用于实际手术需求。

Abstract: Electrosurgery is a surgical technique that can improve tissue cutting by
reducing cutting force and bleeding. However, electrosurgery adds a risk of
thermal injury to surrounding tissue. Expert surgeons estimate desirable
cutting velocities based on experience but have no quantifiable reference to
indicate if a particular velocity is optimal. Furthermore, prior demonstrations
of autonomous electrosurgery have primarily used constant tool velocity, which
is not robust to changes in electrosurgical tissue characteristics, power
settings, or tool type. Thermal imaging feedback provides information that can
be used to reduce thermal injury while balancing cutting force by controlling
tool velocity. We introduce Thermography for Electrosurgical Rate Modulation
via Optimization (ThERMO) to autonomously reduce thermal injury while balancing
cutting force by intelligently controlling tool velocity. We demonstrate ThERMO
in tissue phantoms and compare its performance to the constant velocity
approach. Overall, ThERMO improves cut success rate by a factor of three and
can reduce peak cutting force by a factor of two. ThERMO responds to varying
environmental disturbances, reduces damage to tissue, and completes cutting
tasks that would otherwise result in catastrophic failure for the constant
velocity approach.

Motivation: 现有方法大多需要已知工具表面几何形状或耗时较长，且仅限于低维形状参数的工具。为解决这一问题，提出了一种新方法。

Method: 使用粒子滤波技术，每个粒子携带独立的工具形状参数，避免了高维参数空间的直接处理。工具形状通过高维网格表示。

Result: 通过模拟和实验验证，该方法能够同时估计工具形状和接触位置，提高了接触位置估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了高维工具形状下的接触状态估计问题，提高了估计的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: Estimating the contact state between a grasped tool and the environment is
essential for performing contact tasks such as assembly and object
manipulation. Force signals are valuable for estimating the contact state, as
they can be utilized even when the contact location is obscured by the tool.
Previous studies proposed methods for estimating contact positions using
force/torque signals; however, most methods require the geometry of the tool
surface to be known. Although several studies have proposed methods that do not
require the tool shape, these methods require considerable time for estimation
or are limited to tools with low-dimensional shape parameters. Here, we propose
a method for simultaneously estimating the contact position and tool shape,
where the tool shape is represented by a grid, which is high-dimensional (more
than 1000 dimensional). The proposed method uses a particle filter in which
each particle has individual tool shape parameters, thereby to avoid directly
handling a high-dimensional parameter space. The proposed method is evaluated
through simulations and experiments using tools with curved shapes on a plane.
Consequently, the proposed method can estimate the shape of the tool
simultaneously with the contact positions, making the contact-position
estimation more accurate.

Abstract: Planning collision free trajectories in complex environments remains a core
challenge in robotics. Existing corridor based planners which rely on
decomposition of the free space into collision free subsets scale poorly with
environmental complexity and require explicit allocations of time windows to
trajectory segments. We introduce a new trajectory parameterization that
represents trajectories in a nonconvex collision free corridor as being in a
convex cartesian product of balls. This parameterization allows us to decouple
problem size from geometric complexity of the solution and naturally avoids
explicit time allocation by allowing trajectories to evolve continuously inside
ellipsoidal corridors. Building on this representation, we formulate the
Orthogonal Trust Region Problem (Orth-TRP), a specialized convex program with
separable block constraints, and develop a solver that exploits this parallel
structure and the unique structure of each parallel subproblem for efficient
optimization. Experiments on a quadrotor trajectory planning benchmark show
that our approach produces smoother trajectories and lower runtimes than
state-of-the-art corridor based planners, especially in highly complicated
environments.

Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在多任务和多环境中表现出强大的泛化能力，但其依赖人类演示的大规模数据收集限制了可扩展性。传统强化学习在稀疏奖励的长时程任务中表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的方法来生成演示数据。

Method: 作者提出了一种改进的扩散策略优化算法，利用扩散模型的高表达能力和迭代去噪过程的隐式正则化，生成平滑且一致的演示数据。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，生成的轨迹比人类演示和高斯强化学习生成的轨迹更平滑、更一致；仅使用扩散强化学习生成的数据训练的VLA模型成功率高达81.9%，分别比人类数据和高斯RL数据训练的模型高出5.3%和12.6%。

Conclusion: 扩散强化学习是一种有效的替代方案，能够为VLA模型生成大量高质量、低方差的演示数据。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown strong generalization across
tasks and embodiments; however, their reliance on large-scale human
demonstrations limits their scalability owing to the cost and effort of manual
data collection. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential alternative to
generate demonstrations autonomously, yet conventional RL algorithms often
struggle on long-horizon manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. In this paper,
we propose a modified diffusion policy optimization algorithm to generate
high-quality and low-variance trajectories, which contributes to a diffusion
RL-powered VLA training pipeline. Our algorithm benefits from not only the high
expressiveness of diffusion models to explore complex and diverse behaviors but
also the implicit regularization of the iterative denoising process to yield
smooth and consistent demonstrations. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO
benchmark, which includes 130 long-horizon manipulation tasks, and show that
the generated trajectories are smoother and more consistent than both human
demonstrations and those from standard Gaussian RL policies. Further, training
a VLA model exclusively on the diffusion RL-generated data achieves an average
success rate of 81.9%, which outperforms the model trained on human data by
+5.3% and that on Gaussian RL-generated data by +12.6%. The results highlight
our diffusion RL as an effective alternative for generating abundant,
high-quality, and low-variance demonstrations for VLA models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DynaFlow是将可微分模拟器嵌入流匹配模型的新框架，通过生成动作空间轨迹并映射到动态可行的状态轨迹，确保输出物理一致性。该框架能在只使用状态演示的情况下训练，同时生成物理一致的状态轨迹和推断动作序列。实验证明其在真实四足机器人上有效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从仅状态演示中生成物理一致的动作序列的挑战，并弥合运动学数据与实际执行之间的差距。

Method: 采用可微分模拟器嵌入流匹配模型，生成动作空间轨迹并通过模拟器映射到状态轨迹，实现端到端可微分训练。

Result: 实验表明，DynaFlow能生成可部署的有效动作，并在真实四足机器人上成功复现步态和执行长时程运动。

Conclusion: DynaFlow通过物理一致性保障和端到端训练，有效连接运动学数据与实际硬件执行，适用于现实世界应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces DynaFlow, a novel framework that embeds a
differentiable simulator directly into a flow matching model. By generating
trajectories in the action space and mapping them to dynamically feasible state
trajectories via the simulator, DynaFlow ensures all outputs are physically
consistent by construction. This end-to-end differentiable architecture enables
training on state-only demonstrations, allowing the model to simultaneously
generate physically consistent state trajectories while inferring the
underlying action sequences required to produce them. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through quantitative evaluations and showcase its
real-world applicability by deploying the generated actions onto a physical Go1
quadruped robot. The robot successfully reproduces diverse gait present in the
dataset, executes long-horizon motions in open-loop control and translates
infeasible kinematic demonstrations into dynamically executable, stylistic
behaviors. These hardware experiments validate that DynaFlow produces
deployable, highly effective motions on real-world hardware from state-only
demonstrations, effectively bridging the gap between kinematic data and
real-world execution.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种开放词汇的语义探索系统，用于半静态环境中的机器人导航，通过持续跟踪环境变化和主动探索未访问区域，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中的机器人需要适应环境变化并高效完成任务，但现有研究多关注静态场景，缺乏对半静态环境中对象级实例变化的持续跟踪。

Method: 系统通过建立对象实例稳定性的概率模型，系统跟踪半静态变化，并结合基于大语言模型的推理进行开放词汇目标导航。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高精度的同时显著减少了探索需求，为半静态环境中的机器人导航提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Robots deployed in real-world environments, such as homes, must not only
navigate safely but also understand their surroundings and adapt to environment
changes. To perform tasks efficiently, they must build and maintain a semantic
map that accurately reflects the current state of the environment. Existing
research on semantic exploration largely focuses on static scenes without
persistent object-level instance tracking. A consistent map is, however,
crucial for real-world robotic applications where objects in the environment
can be removed, reintroduced, or shifted over time. In this work, to close this
gap, we propose an open-vocabulary, semantic exploration system for semi-static
environments. Our system maintains a consistent map by building a probabilistic
model of object instance stationarity, systematically tracking semi-static
changes, and actively exploring areas that have not been visited for a
prolonged period of time. In addition to active map maintenance, our approach
leverages the map's semantic richness with LLM-based reasoning for
open-vocabulary object-goal navigation. This enables the robot to search more
efficiently by prioritizing contextually relevant areas. We evaluate our
approach across multiple real-world semi-static environments. Our system
detects 95% of map changes on average, improving efficiency by more than 29% as
compared to random and patrol baselines. Overall, our approach achieves a
mapping precision within 2% of a fully rebuilt map while requiring
substantially less exploration and further completes object goal navigation
tasks about 14% faster than the next-best tested strategy (coverage
patrolling). A video of our work can be found at

Motivation: 多阶段机器人任务常因视觉相似的观测导致动作模糊，需要一种能明确捕捉任务阶段并解决模糊性的方法。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，基于HMDP建模任务，通过状态转移网络推断隐藏状态，并结合状态感知的动作策略。采用半自动标注减少人工标注。

Result: 在复杂任务中，SAGE实现了100%成功率，显著优于基线方法。仅需13%手动标注即可保持高性能。

Conclusion: SAGE有效解决了多阶段任务的状态模糊问题，显著提升了任务成功率，同时降低了人工标注成本。

Abstract: Multi-stage sequential (MSS) robotic manipulation tasks are prevalent and
crucial in robotics. They often involve state ambiguity, where visually similar
observations correspond to different actions. We present SAGE, a state-aware
guided imitation learning framework that models tasks as a Hidden Markov
Decision Process (HMDP) to explicitly capture latent task stages and resolve
ambiguity. We instantiate the HMDP with a state transition network that infers
hidden states, and a state-aware action policy that conditions on both
observations and hidden states to produce actions, thereby enabling
disambiguation across task stages. To reduce manual annotation effort, we
propose a semi-automatic labeling pipeline combining active learning and soft
label interpolation. In real-world experiments across multiple complex MSS
tasks with state ambiguity, SAGE achieved 100% task success under the standard
evaluation protocol, markedly surpassing the baselines. Ablation studies
further show that such performance can be maintained with manual labeling for
only about 13% of the states, indicating its strong effectiveness.

Abstract: Achieving diverse and stable dexterous grasping for general and deformable
objects remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, due to high-dimensional
action spaces and uncertainty in perception. In this paper, we present D3Grasp,
a multimodal perception-guided reinforcement learning framework designed to
enable Diverse and Deformable Dexterous Grasping. We firstly introduce a
unified multimodal representation that integrates visual and tactile perception
to robustly grasp common objects with diverse properties. Second, we propose an
asymmetric reinforcement learning architecture that exploits privileged
information during training while preserving deployment realism, enhancing both
generalization and sample efficiency. Third, we meticulously design a training
strategy to synthesize contact-rich, penetration-free, and kinematically
feasible grasps with enhanced adaptability to deformable and contact-sensitive
objects. Extensive evaluations confirm that D3Grasp delivers highly robust
performance across large-scale and diverse object categories, and substantially
advances the state of the art in dexterous grasping for deformable and
compliant objects, even under perceptual uncertainty and real-world
disturbances. D3Grasp achieves an average success rate of 95.1% in real-world

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in structured and complex indoor environments remains
a challenging task, as existing methods often struggle to appropriately model

synergistically combines global graph inference with diffusion-based
decision-making. We introduce a region-evaluation global graph representation
that integrates both observed environmental data and predictions of unexplored
areas, enhanced by a region-level evaluation mechanism to prioritize reliable
structural inferences while discounting uncertain predictions. Building upon
this enriched representation, a diffusion policy network generates stable,
foresighted action sequences with significantly reduced denoising steps.
Extensive simulations and real-world deployments demonstrate that GUIDE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 18.3% faster
coverage completion and a 34.9% reduction in redundant movements.

Conclusion: RT-V2通过概率建模和强化学习，为共享控制提供了通用且高效的方法。

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic shared-control solution for navigation, called
Robot Trajectron V2 (RT-V2), that enables accurate intent prediction and safe,
effective assistance in human-robot interaction. RT-V2 jointly models a user's
long-term behavioral patterns and their noisy, low-dimensional control signals
by combining a prior intent model with a posterior update that accounts for
real-time user input and environmental context. The prior captures the
multimodal and history-dependent nature of user intent using recurrent neural
networks and conditional variational autoencoders, while the posterior
integrates this with uncertain user commands to infer desired actions. We
conduct extensive experiments to validate RT-V2 across synthetic benchmarks,
human-computer interaction studies with keyboard input, and brain-machine
interface experiments with non-human primates. Results show that RT-V2
outperforms the state of the art in intent estimation, provides safe and
efficient navigation support, and adequately balances user autonomy with
assistive intervention. By unifying probabilistic modeling, reinforcement
learning, and safe optimization, RT-V2 offers a principled and generalizable
approach to shared control for diverse assistive technologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalist robot manipulation leverage pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large-scale robot demonstrations to tackle
diverse tasks in a zero-shot manner. A key challenge remains: scaling
high-quality, action-labeled robot demonstration data, which existing methods
rely on for robustness and generalization. To address this, we propose a method
that benefits from videos without action labels - featuring humans and/or
robots in action - enhancing open-vocabulary performance and enabling
data-efficient learning of new tasks. Our method extracts dense, dynamic 3D
point clouds at the hand or gripper location and uses a proposed 3D dynamics
predictor for self-supervision. This predictor is then tuned to an action
predictor using a smaller labeled dataset for action alignment. We show that
our method not only learns from unlabeled human and robot demonstrations -
improving downstream generalist robot policies - but also enables robots to
learn new tasks without action labels (i.e., out-of-action generalization) in
both real-world and simulated settings.

Motivation: 当前大型活跃粒子系统（如人群、机器人群体）的控制策略缺乏可扩展性和鲁棒性，尤其是需要单独控制每个代理的问题。

Result: 实验表明该方法在机器人疏散人群的应用中表现出高效和鲁棒性，优于直接应用强化学习的传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂场景下的活跃粒子系统控制提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Manipulation of large systems of active particles is a serious challenge
across diverse domains, including crowd management, control of robotic swarms,
and coordinated material transport. The development of advanced control
strategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of
scalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the
need of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves
controlling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents
tend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy
for a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces
acting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader
we introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to
the problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large
groups of people from hazardous places. We demonstrate, that while a
straightforward application of RL yields suboptimal results, even for advanced
architectures, our approach provides a robust and efficient evacuation
strategy. The source code supporting this study is publicly available at:

Abstract: This paper presents a lidar-only state estimation and tracking framework,
along with a roadside sensing unit for integration with existing urban
infrastructure. Urban deployments demand scalable, real-time tracking
solutions, yet traditional remote sensing remains costly and computationally
intensive, especially under perceptually degraded conditions. Our sensor node
couples a single lidar with an edge computing unit and runs a computationally
efficient, GPU-free observer that simultaneously estimates object state, class,
dimensions, and existence probability. The pipeline performs: (i) state updates
via an extended Kalman filter, (ii) dimension estimation using a 1D
grid-map/Bayesian update, (iii) class updates via a lookup table driven by the
most probable footprint, and (iv) existence estimation from track age and
bounding-box consistency. Experiments in dynamic urban-like scenes with diverse
traffic participants demonstrate real-time performance and high precision: The
complete end-to-end pipeline finishes within \SI{100}{\milli\second} for
\SI{99.88}{\%} of messages, with an excellent detection rate. Robustness is
further confirmed under simulated wind and sensor vibration. These results
indicate that reliable, real-time roadside tracking is feasible on CPU-only
edge hardware, enabling scalable, privacy-friendly deployments within existing
city infrastructure. The framework integrates with existing poles, traffic
lights, and buildings, reducing deployment costs and simplifying large-scale
urban rollouts and maintenance efforts.

Conclusion: MARG控制器通过高效的地图生成和奖励设计，实现了在复杂地形中的稳定运动策略。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controllers for quadrupedal locomotion have
demonstrated impressive performance on challenging terrains, allowing robots to
execute complex skills such as climbing, running, and jumping. However,
existing blind locomotion controllers often struggle to ensure safety and
efficient traversal through risky gap terrains, which are typically highly
complex, requiring robots to perceive terrain information and select
appropriate footholds during locomotion accurately. Meanwhile, existing
perception-based controllers still present several practical limitations,
including a complex multi-sensor deployment system and expensive computing
resource requirements. This paper proposes a DRL controller named MAstering
Risky Gap Terrains (MARG), which integrates terrain maps and proprioception to
dynamically adjust the action and enhance the robot's stability in these tasks.
During the training phase, our controller accelerates policy optimization by
selectively incorporating privileged information (e.g., center of mass,
friction coefficients) that are available in simulation but unmeasurable
directly in real-world deployments due to sensor limitations. We also designed
three foot-related rewards to encourage the robot to explore safe footholds.
More importantly, a terrain map generation (TMG) model is proposed to reduce
the drift existing in mapping and provide accurate terrain maps using only one
LiDAR, providing a foundation for zero-shot transfer of the learned policy. The
experimental results indicate that MARG maintains stability in various risky
terrain tasks.

Abstract: We present LLM Trainer, a fully automated pipeline that leverages the world
knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform a small number of human
demonstrations (as few as one) into a large robot dataset for imitation
learning. Our approach decomposes demonstration generation into two steps: (1)
offline demonstration annotation that extracts keyframes, salient objects, and
pose-object relations; and (2) online keypose retargeting that adapts those
keyframes to a new scene, given an initial observation. Using these modified
keypoints, our system warps the original demonstration to generate a new
trajectory, which is then executed, and the resulting demo, if successful, is
saved. Because the annotation is reusable across scenes, we use Thompson
sampling to optimize the annotation, significantly improving generation success
rate. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, and find that our data
annotation method consistently outperforms expert-engineered baselines. We
further show an ensemble policy that combines the optimized LLM feed-forward
plan with a learned feedback imitation learning controller. Finally, we
demonstrate hardware feasibility on a Franka Emika Panda robot. For additional

Conclusion: 3D QSR框架成功实现了空间与语义推理的融合，为复杂3D环境中的机器人任务规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: To enable robots to comprehend high-level human instructions and perform
complex tasks, a key challenge lies in achieving comprehensive scene
understanding: interpreting and interacting with the 3D environment in a
meaningful way. This requires a smart map that fuses accurate geometric
structure with rich, human-understandable semantics. To address this, we
introduce the 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR), a novel framework
built on multimedia data that unifies three complementary 3D representations:
(1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic
reconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured,
scalable organization via 3D scene graphs. Built on an object-centric design,
the framework integrates with large vision-language models to enable semantic
queryability by linking multimodal object embeddings, and supporting
object-level retrieval of geometric, visual, and semantic information. The
retrieved data are then loaded into a robotic task planner for downstream
execution. We evaluate our approach through simulated robotic task planning
scenarios in Unity, guided by abstract language instructions and using the
indoor public dataset Replica. Furthermore, we apply it in a digital duplicate
of a real wet lab environment to test QSR-supported robotic task planning for
emergency response. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to
facilitate scene understanding and integrate spatial and semantic reasoning,
effectively translating high-level human instructions into precise robotic task
planning in complex 3D environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a high-efficiency, CPU-only volumetric mapping framework
based on a Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). The system incrementally
fuses raw LiDAR point-cloud data into a voxel grid using a directional
bitmask-based integration scheme, producing dense and consistent TSDF
representations suitable for real-time 3D reconstruction. A key feature of the
approach is that the processing time per point-cloud remains constant,
regardless of the voxel grid resolution, enabling high resolution mapping
without sacrificing runtime performance. In contrast to most recent TSDF/ESDF
methods that rely on GPU acceleration, our method operates entirely on CPU,
achieving competitive results in speed. Experiments on real-world open datasets
demonstrate that the generated maps attain accuracy on par with contemporary
mapping techniques.

Conclusion: C-3TO为空中机器人提供了一种鲁棒且通用的局部重规划基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for continuous 3D trajectory
optimization in cluttered environments, leveraging online neural Euclidean
Signed Distance Fields (ESDFs). Unlike prior approaches that rely on
discretized ESDF grids with interpolation, our method directly optimizes smooth
trajectories represented by fifth-order polynomials over a continuous neural
ESDF, ensuring precise gradient information throughout the entire trajectory.
The framework integrates a two-stage nonlinear optimization pipeline that
balances efficiency, safety and smoothness. Experimental results demonstrate
that C-3TO produces collision-aware and dynamically feasible trajectories.
Moreover, its flexibility in defining local window sizes and optimization
parameters enables straightforward adaptation to diverse user's needs without
compromising performance. By combining continuous trajectory parameterization
with a continuously updated neural ESDF, C-3TO establishes a robust and
generalizable foundation for safe and efficient local replanning in aerial
robotics.

approach augments control barrier functions with a novel $\psi$-weighted
formulation that encodes directional control alignment between agents into the
safety constraints. Deterministic admissibility is combined with empirical

on margin-aware safety violations to provide a probabilistic safety
certificate. The results from the experiments conducted under different bounded

TL;DR: ReflectDrive是一种基于反射机制的新型学习框架，通过离散扩散生成安全轨迹，解决了现有VLA模型在自主驾驶中模仿学习的局限性，无需复杂的梯度计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型受限于模仿学习，难以编码物理规则，且依赖复杂后处理或计算昂贵的扩散指导，需要更高效与安全的方法支持自主驾驶系统开发。

Method: 提出ReflectDrive框架，先离散化驾驶空间构建动作码本，利用预训练扩散语言模型规划任务，并通过无梯度计算的安全感知反射机制迭代自校正。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ReflectDrive在安全关键轨迹生成方面表现出显著优势，提供了可扩展和可靠的解决方案。

Conclusion: ReflectDrive通过反射机制和离散扩散提供了高效、安全的轨迹生成方法，有望推动自主驾驶系统的进一步发展。

Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for
autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge
from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex
real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the
limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode
physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex
rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely
limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires
computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,
we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a
reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We
first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action
codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for
planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware
reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient
computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to
model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search
methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then
serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the
NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in
safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable
solution for autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 传统机器人尾巴设计难以同时满足动力和安全性需求，刚性尾巴在非结构化环境中存在风险，而软体尾巴则缺乏足够的速度和力量。

Method: 开发了一种结合被动关节脊椎和柔性气动体的混合设计，并建立了包含脊椎约束的动力学模型。

Result: BVSR尾巴表现出超过670°/s的角速度，并可产生高达5.58N的力和1.21Nm的扭矩，性能提升超过200%。

Conclusion: BVSR尾巴在多种任务中展现出优异的性能和实用性，适用于敏捷机器人平台。

Abstract: Robotic tails can enhance the stability and maneuverability of mobile robots,
but current designs face a trade-off between the power of rigid systems and the
safety of soft ones. Rigid tails generate large inertial effects but pose risks
in unstructured environments, while soft tails lack sufficient speed and force.
We present a Biomimetic Vertebraic Soft Robotic (BVSR) tail that resolves this
challenge through a compliant pneumatic body reinforced by a passively jointed
vertebral column inspired by musculoskeletal structures. This hybrid design
decouples load-bearing and actuation, enabling high-pressure actuation (up to 6
bar) for superior dynamics while preserving compliance. A dedicated kinematic
and dynamic model incorporating vertebral constraints is developed and
validated experimentally. The BVSR tail achieves angular velocities above
670{\deg}/s and generates inertial forces and torques up to 5.58 N and 1.21 Nm,
indicating over 200% improvement compared to non-vertebraic designs.
Demonstrations on rapid cart stabilization, obstacle negotiation, high-speed
steering, and quadruped integration confirm its versatility and practical
utility for agile robotic platforms.

Abstract: The accuracy, resilience, and affordability of localisation are fundamental
to autonomous robotic inspection within aircraft maintenance and overhaul (MRO)
hangars. Hangars typically feature tall ceilings and are often made of
materials such as metal. Due to its nature, it is considered a GPS-denied
environment, with extensive multipath effects and stringent operational
constraints that collectively create a uniquely challenging environment. This
persistent gap highlights the need for domain-specific comparative studies,
including rigorous cost, accuracy, and integration assessments, to inform a
reliable and scalable deployment of a localisation system in the Smart Hangar.
This paper presents the first techno-economic roadmap that benchmarks motion
capture (MoCap), ultra-wideband (UWB), and a ceiling-mounted camera network
across three operational scenarios: robot localisation, asset tracking, and
surface defect detection within a 40x50 m hangar bay. A dual-layer optimisation
for camera selection and positioning framework is introduced, which couples
market-based camera-lens selection with an optimisation solver, producing
camera layouts that minimise hardware while meeting accuracy targets. The
roadmap equips MRO planners with an actionable method to balance accuracy,
coverage, and budget, demonstrating that an optimised vision architecture has
the potential to unlock robust and cost-effective sensing for next-generation
Smart Hangars.

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中表现优异，具备强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AnchDrive通过锚点引导的扩散策略，显著提升了轨迹生成的多样性和质量。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in
autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the
generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a
framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy
to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models.
Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a
rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two
complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set
of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in
real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features.
The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a
distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This
anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse,
high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that
AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability

Motivation: 传统逆运动学方法虽能实现机械有效配置，但往往缺乏类人性，HL-IK旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用大规模人类运动数据训练FiSTA网络预测肘部姿态，并将其作为残差项整合至标准优化器中。

Result: 在18.3万次模拟步骤中，HL-IK将位置和方向误差平均降低了30.6%和35.4%。

Conclusion: HL-IK简单易集成，计算开销低，能显著提升人形机器人动作的类人性。

Abstract: Traditional IK methods for redundant humanoid manipulators emphasize
end-effector (EE) tracking, frequently producing configurations that are valid
mechanically but not human-like. We present Human-Like Inverse Kinematics
(HL-IK), a lightweight IK framework that preserves EE tracking while shaping
whole-arm configurations to appear human-like, without full-body sensing at
runtime. The key idea is a learned elbow prior: using large-scale human motion
data retargeted to the robot, we train a FiLM-modulated spatio-temporal
attention network (FiSTA) to predict the next-step elbow pose from the EE
target and a short history of EE-elbow states.This prediction is incorporated
as a small residual alongside EE and smoothness terms in a standard
Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer, making HL-IK a drop-in addition to numerical IK
stacks. Over 183k simulation steps, HL-IK reduces arm-similarity position and
direction error by 30.6% and 35.4% on average, and by 42.2% and 47.4% on the
most challenging trajectories. Hardware teleoperation on a robot distinct from
simulation further confirms the gains in anthropomorphism. HL-IK is simple to
integrate, adaptable across platforms via our pipeline, and adds minimal
computation, enabling human-like motions for humanoid robots. Project page:

Conclusion: PAD成功实现了从单个人类视频学习通用双手策略的突破，为机器人泛化学习提供了高效且低成本的新途径。

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies from expert demonstrations is an important
frontier in modern robotics research, however, most popular methods require
copious efforts for collecting teleoperation data and struggle to generalize
out-ofdistribution. Scaling data collection has been explored through
leveraging human videos, as well as demonstration augmentation techniques. The
latter approach typically requires expensive simulation rollouts and trains
policies with synthetic image data, therefore introducing a sim-to-real gap. In
parallel, alternative state representations such as keypoints have shown great
promise for category-level generalization. In this work, we bring these avenues
together in a unified framework: PAD (Parse-AugmentDistill), for learning
generalizable bimanual policies from a single human video. Our method relies on
three steps: (a) parsing a human video demo into a robot-executable
keypoint-action trajectory, (b) employing bimanual task-and-motion-planning to
augment the demonstration at scale without simulators, and (c) distilling the
augmented trajectories into a keypoint-conditioned policy. Empirically, we
showcase that PAD outperforms state-ofthe-art bimanual demonstration
augmentation works relying on image policies with simulation rollouts, both in
terms of success rate and sample/cost efficiency. We deploy our framework in
six diverse real-world bimanual tasks such as pouring drinks, cleaning trash
and opening containers, producing one-shot policies that generalize in unseen
spatial arrangements, object instances and background distractors.

Abstract: End-to-end learning of robot control policies, structured as neural networks,
has emerged as a promising approach to robotic manipulation. To complete many
common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's
field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the
spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However,
building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research
problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D
Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based
on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation
experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where
state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle. We release our
reconstruction system, training code, and evaluation tasks to spur research in
this direction.

Conclusion: VisualMimic提供了一种高效的方法，实现了类人机器人在复杂环境中的运动和操作任务。

Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments demands tight
integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control. However, existing
approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to
generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real
framework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control
for humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint
tracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with
a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual
and proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the
low-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics.
VisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in
simulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of
loco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and
kicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize
robustly to outdoor environments. Videos are available at:

Motivation: 当前机器人学习论文通常仅报告单一二进制成功率，无法展示多步骤任务中各子目标的成功与失败情况，限制了政策评估的透明度和改进方向的明确性。

Method: 提出StepEval框架，利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）从记录的图像或视频中自动化评估子目标结果，设计原则包括可扩展、社区驱动的开源项目，支持单视角或多视角输入。

Conclusion: StepEval框架旨在成为一种标准化的评估实践，通过开源社区的贡献，推动机器人学习政策评估的透明度和可重复性。

Abstract: Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR),
which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation
task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each
trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible
(e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware
plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as
automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather
than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design
principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval,
the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector;
however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered
for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation
efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available.
We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or
multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended
contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites
open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal,
becomes a standard and reproducible practice.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for
achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for
various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical
systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models
(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs
empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing
high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions
into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building
internal representations and future predictions of the external world,
facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper
comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,
covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present
the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied
AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal

embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,
meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied
cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the
above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint

significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we
examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide
applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散概率模型在离线强化学习中主要关注时域特征，忽视频域特征，导致频移和性能下降。作者从频域新视角出发，发现仅关注时域会引入低频分量偏移，从而影响轨迹稳定性和性能。

Method: 提出WFDiffuser框架，整合离散小波变换分解轨迹为高低频分量，并利用短时傅里叶变换和交叉注意力机制提取频域特征及促进跨频交互。

Conclusion: 通过结合频域特征，WFDiffuser显著提升了扩散模型在离线强化学习中的表现，验证了频域分析的重要性。

Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline
reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking
frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance
according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from
a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that
time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency
components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and
degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier
Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates
Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and
high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each
component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention
mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency
interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate
that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother,
more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing
methods.

Motivation: 心电图（ECG）在临床中是心脏病监测的金标准，但其依赖专业设备和人员限制了连续性监测。光电脉搏波（PPG）虽便于连续监测，但缺乏电生理信息，无法进行确定性诊断。因此，需要一种方法将PPG转换为有价值的ECG信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效实现PPG到ECG的转换及心血管疾病检测，生成的ECG信号具有高保真性并提升了诊断可靠性。

Conclusion: PPGFlowECG展示了在真实世界心血管筛查中的应用潜力，为连续监测提供了新思路。

Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for
cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment
and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring.
Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks
definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis.
Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically
valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges,
including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and
the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose
PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent
space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate
ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade
dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than
118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease
annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG
translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led
evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve
diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world

*Rami Zewail*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合框架DACL，结合扩散模型和监督对比学习，用于增强生物信号的表示学习，并在ECG数据集上取得了竞争力的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法难以捕捉生理数据的复杂变化，需要更有效的方法来学习稳健表示。

Method: DACL框架通过轻量级VAE和散射变换特征生成潜在空间，利用扩散前向过程生成多个噪声视图，再用U-Net风格的编码器和监督对比目标学习表示。

Result: 在PhysioNet 2017 ECG数据集上达到0.7815的AUROC。

Conclusion: DACL通过扩散过程驱动对比目标，建立了噪声不变的嵌入表示，为类别可分性提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the
challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can
fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within
this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented
Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and
supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space
created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel
Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward
process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy
views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a
supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class
discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We
evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset,
achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm
for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the
contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a
strong foundation for class separability.

TL;DR: 该论文综述了仅从专家状态观察中学习的模仿学习方法（LfO/SOIL），提出了一个分类框架，并指出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的模仿学习需要专家的状态和动作信息，但在实际应用中获取专家动作可能不切实际。因此，研究仅从专家状态中学习的LfO方法具有重要意义。

Method: 论文提出了一个LfO的分类框架，对现有方法进行梳理，重点分析了轨迹构建、假设条件和算法设计。

Result: 通过框架分析了现有LfO方法，并揭示了其与离线强化学习、基于模型的强化学习和分层强化学习之间的联系。

Conclusion: 论文总结了LfO领域的现状，指出了开放性问题并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent
by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL
algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert
demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance,
requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world
applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this
limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only
imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator
only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we
present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO
methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's
design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related
fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our
framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.

### [103] [RDAR: Reward-Driven Agent Relevance Estimation for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19789)
*Carlo Bosio,Greg Woelki,Noureldin Hendy,Nicholas Roy,Byungsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为RDAR的策略，通过学习每个智能体的重要性来减少自动驾驶系统中需要处理的智能体数量，从而提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类驾驶员每次只需关注少量周围车辆，而自动驾驶系统则需要处理复杂的场景中的所有车辆，导致计算开销大。现有注意力机制虽然可以隐式减少输入，但计算成本高。

Method: 提出RDAR策略，通过马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）学习每个智能体的相关性，决定哪些智能体可以从预训练行为模型的输入中排除。

Result: 在大规模驾驶数据集上验证了RDAR的有效性，其能够在处理显著减少的智能体数量的同时，保持与先进行为模型相当的驾驶性能（进度、安全性和表现）。

Conclusion: RDAR通过学习智能体相关性，提供了一种高效的自动驾驶输入简化方法，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other
hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents,
regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on
the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to
reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention
mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally
computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent
relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled
vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a
pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov
Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent
selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate
its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving
comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and
performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of
the art behavior model.

TL;DR: Veo 3展示了与大型语言模型类似的零样本能力，预示着视频模型可能成为通用的视觉基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视频模型是否能够像大型语言模型那样实现通用的视觉理解。

Method: 通过Veo 3模型解决未明确训练的任务，如对象分割、边缘检测等。

Result: Veo 3展示了早期视觉推理能力，如迷宫和对称性解决。

Conclusion: 视频模型正在朝着统一、通用的视觉基础模型方向发展。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified,
generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple
primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the
same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be
on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs
developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can
solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting
objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties,
recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities
to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of
visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot
capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified,
generalist vision foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DSP技术（最初用于相干光通信系统）如何改进CV-QKD，特别是在相位同步、偏振跟踪和噪声抑制方面。

Method: 采用APISSER方法（基于PRISMA协议），在IEEE Xplore和Web of Science数据库中筛选并分析2021-2025年的220篇相关文献。

Result: 经典DSP算法（如卡尔曼滤波、载波恢复等）在量子领域成功应用，但需调整以满足安全性需求。未来潜在技术包括神经网络均衡等。

Conclusion: DSP与CV-QKD的融合展示了显著进展，但在超低信噪比条件下的相位跟踪等挑战仍需解决，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This systematic review investigates the application of digital signal
processing (DSP) techniques -- originally developed for coherent optical
communication systems to continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD).
The convergence of these domains has enabled significant advances in CV-QKD
performance, particularly in phase synchronization, polarization tracking, and
excess noise mitigation. To provide a comprehensive and reproducible synthesis
of this emerging field, we employed the APISSER methodology, a task-oriented
framework adapted from the PRISMA protocol. A structured search across IEEE
Xplore and Web of Science databases (2021-2025) yielded 220 relevant
publications, which were screened, classified, and analyzed to address six
research questions. Our findings highlight that many classical DSP algorithms,
such as Kalman filtering, carrier recovery, adaptive equalization, and
machine-learning-assisted signal estimation, have been successfully adapted to
the quantum regime, often requiring modifications to meet security and noise
constraints. We also identify a range of recent DSP innovations in coherent
optical communication systems with high potential for future CV-QKD
integration, including neural equalization, probabilistic shaping, and joint
retiming-equalization filters. Despite these advances, challenges remain in
achieving robust phase tracking under ultra-low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
conditions, real-time polarization compensation, and secure co-existence with
classical channels. This review maps current trends, technical barriers, and
emerging opportunities at the intersection of signal processing for quantum and
classical communication, supporting the development of scalable and resilient
CV-QKD systems.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种非线性最优制导律，使追击者能以任意几何模式包围目标，超越了传统的圆形包围。方法仅需相对状态测量，适用于有转向约束的飞行器，并扩展了现有策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有制导策略局限于目标包围，且通常需要目标机动的精确信息。本文旨在打破这些限制，提供更灵活的包围模式，并增强抗干扰能力。

Method: 基于状态相关Riccati方程（SDRE）框架，将非线性动力学伪线性化，通过状态相关权重矩阵设计局部最优反馈指令，并引入积分滑动模态以补偿干扰。

Result: 仿真验证了方法的有效性，能够在干扰下保持性能，且允许未知的（可能时变）目标曲率。

Conclusion: 所提制导律扩展了传统策略，具有灵活性和鲁棒性，适用于复杂包围任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes a nonlinear optimal guidance law that enables a pursuer
to enclose a target within arbitrary geometric patterns, which extends beyond
conventional circular encirclement. The design operates using only relative
state measurements and formulates a target enclosing guidance law in which the
vehicle's lateral acceleration serves as the steering control, making it
well-suited for aerial vehicles with turning constraints. Our approach
generalizes and extends existing guidance strategies that are limited to target
encirclement and provides a degree of optimality. At the same time, the exact
information of the target's maneuver is unnecessary during the design. The
guidance law is developed within the framework of a state-dependent Riccati
equation (SDRE), thereby providing a systematic way to handle nonlinear
dynamics through a pseudo-linear representation to design locally optimal
feedback guidance commands through state-dependent weighting matrices. While
SDRE ensures near-optimal performance in the absence of strong disturbances, we
further augment the design to incorporate an integral sliding mode manifold to
compensate when disturbances push the system away from the nominal trajectory,
and demonstrate that the design provides flexibility in the sense that the
(possibly time-varying) stand-off curvature could also be treated as unknown.
Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为“伪无向图”的网络拓扑框架，通过允许节点对之间的边权重不同（包括有界负值），扩展了共识问题的解空间，使系统能够达成初始状态集凸包外的稳定共识值。

Motivation: 传统共识问题使用无向图或有向图存在限制，无法灵活达成某些共识值。论文的目的是通过伪无向图扩展共识问题的解空间，并保持稳健性。

Method: 引入伪无向图的概念，允许边权重不同且可包含有界负值，推导了负权重的容许边界，分析了其拉普拉斯矩阵的非对称性及其对共识的影响。

Result: 伪无向图在连通性假设下能达成稳定共识值，且该值可超出初始状态集的凸包，证明了负权重的容许边界，并以拦截移动目标为例展示了应用。

Conclusion: 伪无向图为共识问题提供了更大的灵活性，拓展了传统图论的限制，具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Consensus over networked agents is typically studied using undirected or
directed communication graphs. Undirected graphs enforce symmetry in
information exchange, leading to convergence to the average of initial states,
while directed graphs permit asymmetry but make consensus dependent on root
nodes and their influence. Both paradigms impose inherent restrictions on
achievable consensus values and network robustness. This paper introduces a
theoretical framework for achieving consensus over a class of network
topologies, termed pseudo-undirected graphs, which retains bidirectional
connectivity between node pairs but allows the corresponding edge weights to
differ, including the possibility of negative values under bounded conditions.
The resulting Laplacian is generally non-symmetric, yet it guarantees consensus
under connectivity assumptions, to expand the solution space, which enables the
system to achieve a stable consensus value that can lie outside the convex hull
of the initial state set. We derive admissibility bounds for negative weights
for a pseudo-undirected path graph, and show an application in the simultaneous
interception of a moving target.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶在非均匀地形（如露天矿场和发展中国家）需要低延迟智能系统，尤其是在无预定义路径的复杂环境中。

Method: 提出了可配置模块化分割网络（CMSNet）框架，支持不同架构组合，并通过TensorRT、C++和CUDA优化实现实时推理。使用了包含近12,000张图像的新数据集Kamino进行训练和测试。

Result: 实验验证了CMSNet在恶劣条件下（如夜间、雨、灰尘）的有效性，并实现了实时语义分割。

Conclusion: CMSNet框架和Kamino数据集为复杂地形下的自动驾驶提供了实用解决方案，同时支持实时性能优化。

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on
non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work
proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and
off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined
trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is
proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet
configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new
images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,
dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions
without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility
impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A
new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating
vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number
of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images
from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To
achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and
fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets
validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

Method: 使用更高容量的分割主干网络，通过模块化2D CNN和时序一致性网络生成LiDAR样点云。

Result: 实验表明，过高容量的模型会损害性能，但选取合适的主干网络可实现23.7%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 适中的分割主干网络能显著提升雷达生成点云的质量，为低成本自动驾驶系统提供可行方案。

Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding
environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by
offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost
continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD)
systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress
towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using
LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds
using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to
train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional
neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that
uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we
investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality
of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity
models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can
provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Result: 在TartanAir和VOID数据集表现优异，AR Table数据集零样本泛化能力强，10-20个稀疏深度点即可稳定工作。

Conclusion: VIMD框架高效、模块化，适用于资源受限场景，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual
perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular
visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense
metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular
visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit
multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of
globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD
framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing
depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir
and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on
the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy
and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth
points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for
deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and
strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide
range of scenarios.

Motivation: 尽管 Embodied AI 在复杂任务和环境适应方面取得进展，但在现实人类场景（如家庭环境）中的部署仍面临挑战，主要因个体偏好和行为建模困难。

Method: 引入 PersONAL 基准测试，包含 2000+ 高质量场景和 30+ 逼真家庭环境，要求代理通过自然语言查询（例如“找到 Lily 的背包”）识别、检索和导航，支持两种评估模式：主动导航和对象定位。

Conclusion: PersONAL 为开发现实世界辅助机器人提供了新方向，强调了个性化在 Embodied AI 中的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly
complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents
in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains
challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human
preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized
Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study
personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to
objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries
such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality
episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode
includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations
between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific
semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation
in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes.
Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human
performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving,
reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards
real-world assistive robot.

Motivation: 高光谱成像（HSI）在复杂环境中能提供丰富的空间和光谱信息，但现有方法因依赖RGB输入优化框架而表现不佳，因此需要开发一种能直接处理HSI数据的高效方法。

Method: 通过结合光谱变换器和光谱感知空间先验模块提取特征，并引入模态感知交互块，将高光谱表示与冻结的视觉Transformer特征有效整合。

Result: 在三种自动驾驶数据集上的评估表明，该方法在语义分割任务中表现优异，优于现有RGB和高光谱分割方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的高光谱适配器能有效处理HSI数据，为复杂环境下的机器人感知提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense
spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich
spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception,
particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying
illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI
semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on
architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work,
we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision
foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our
architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial
prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we
introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective
integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer
features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive
evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our
architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while
directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral
segmentation methods. We make the code available at

Motivation: 为解决ℓ₁范数在稀疏优化中可能导致幅度较小的解的问题，研究人员提出了多种非凸稀疏惩罚方法，ULPENS旨在通过非可分性实现对元素抑制的灵活控制。

Method: ULPENS基于超离散化公式，通过调整参数在ℓ₁范数与选择性抑制函数之间连续插值，同时保持光滑性以便使用梯度优化算法。

Result: 理论研究验证了ULPENS的关键特性，数值实验展示了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: ULPENS作为一种新型稀疏惩罚函数，通过灵活的参数调节和高效优化能力，为稀疏优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In sparse optimization, the $\ell_{1}$ norm is widely adopted for its
convexity, yet it often yields solutions with smaller magnitudes than expected.
To mitigate this drawback, various non-convex sparse penalties have been
proposed. Some employ non-separability, with ordered weighting as an effective
example, to retain large components while suppressing small ones. Motivated by
these approaches, we propose ULPENS, a non-convex, non-separable
sparsity-inducing penalty function that enables control over the suppression of
elements. Derived from the ultra-discretization formula, ULPENS can
continuously interpolate between the $\ell_{1}$ norm and a non-convex selective
suppressing function by adjusting parameters inherent to the formula. With the
formula, ULPENS is smooth, allowing the use of efficient gradient-based
optimization algorithms. We establish key theoretical properties of ULPENS and
demonstrate its practical effectiveness through numerical experiments.
