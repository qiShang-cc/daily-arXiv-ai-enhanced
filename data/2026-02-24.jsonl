Unfortunately, heterogeneous antenna hardware with varying dimensions, orientations, codebooks, element patterns, and polarization angles limits their feasibility and generalization. This challenge requires either a heterogeneity-agnostic model functional under these variations, or developing many models for each configuration, which is infeasible and expensive in practice. In this paper, we propose a unifying AI/ML-based beam selection algorithm supporting antenna heterogeneity by predicting wireless propagation characteristics independent of antenna configuration. We derive a reference signal received power (RSRP) model that decouples propagation characteristics from antenna configuration. We propose an optimization framework to extract propagation variables consisting of angle-of-arrival (AoA), angle-of-departure (AoD), and a matrix incorporating path gain and channel depolarization from beamformed RSRP measurements. We develop a three-stage autoregressive network to predict these variables from user location, enabling RSRP calculation and beam selection for arbitrary antenna configurations without retraining or having a separate model for each configuration. Simulation results show our heterogeneity-agnostic method provides spectral efficiency close to that of genie-aided selection both with and without antenna heterogeneity."}

A hierarchical correlation-based clustering algorithm is developed to group APs according to their channel correlation, enabling each user to be associated with APs that simultaneously provide strong channel gains and low mutual correlation. This association ensures reliable connectivity, maximizes coherent combining gains, and reduces inter-user interference, while also allowing the number of AP clusters to be adjusted flexibly, without the need to reorganize the network completely. By maintaining links to low-correlated APs, the proposed scheme reduces the need for frequent channel state information (CSI) estimation and minimizes network-wide update overhead. To enhance scalability, a user-capacity constraint per AP is incorporated, preventing hardware overload and alleviating the effects of pilot reuse. Furthermore, an effective pilot power allocation strategy is introduced to boost the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) during channel training. This is formulated as a weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem and solved iteratively using a quadratic transform, which enables efficient optimization while ensuring fairness and high-quality service across all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers significant SE gains, maintains performance in high-density multi-user scenarios, and converges faster than benchmark schemes."}

Each correction offers information on what the robot should and should not do, where the corrected behavior is more aligned with task objectives than the original behavior. Most prior work on learning from corrections involves interpreting a correction as a new demonstration (consisting of the modified robot behavior), or a preference (for the modified trajectory compared to the robot's original behavior). However, this overlooks one essential element of the correction feedback, which is the human's decision to intervene in the robot's behavior in the first place. This decision can be influenced by multiple factors including the robot's task progress, alignment with human expectations, dynamics, motion legibility, and optimality. In this work, we investigate whether the timing of this decision can offer a useful signal for inferring these task-relevant influences. In particular, we investigate three potential applications for this learning signal: (1) identifying features of a robot's motion that may prompt people to correct it, (2) quickly inferring the final goal of a human's correction based on the timing and initial direction of their correction motion, and (3) learning more precise constraints for task objectives. Our results indicate that correction timing results in improved learning for the first two of these applications. Overall, our work provides new insights on the value of correction timing as a signal for robot learning."}

We address the problem of generating global costmaps for long-range planning directly from satellite imagery when entities and mission-specific traversal rules are expressed in natural language at test time. This setting is challenging since mission requirements vary, terrain entities may be unknown at deployment, and user prompts often encode compositional traversal logic. Existing approaches relying on fixed ontologies and static cost mappings cannot accommodate such flexibility. While foundation models excel at language interpretation and open-vocabulary perception, no single model can simultaneously parse nuanced mission directives, locate arbitrary entities in large-scale imagery, and synthesize them into an executable cost function for planners. We therefore propose OVerSeeC, a zero-shot modular framework that decomposes the problem into Interpret-Locate-Synthesize: (i) an LLM extracts entities and ranked preferences, (ii) an open-vocabulary segmentation pipeline identifies these entities from high-resolution imagery, and (iii) the LLM uses the user's natural language preferences and masks to synthesize executable costmap code. Empirically, OVerSeeC handles novel entities, respects ranked and compositional preferences, and produces routes consistent with human-drawn trajectories across diverse regions, demonstrating robustness to distribution shifts. This shows that modular composition of foundation models enables open-vocabulary, preference-aligned costmap generation for scalable, mission-adaptive global planning."}

To address the cases, we propose a data-driven model-free physical-informed Deep Operator Network (DeepOnet) framework to learn the nonlinear dynamic systems from few available data. We first explore the short-term dependence of the available data and use a surrogate machine learning model to extract the short-term dependence. Then, the surrogate machine learning model is incorporated into the DeepOnet as the physical information part.

In environments with limited bandwidth, degraded infrastructure, or adversarial interference, existing approaches degrade sharply. We introduce a learning-based framework that achieves high-quality task allocation without any robot-to-robot communication. The key idea is that robots coordinate implicitly by predicting teammates' bids: if each robot can anticipate competition for a task, it can adjust its choices accordingly. Our method predicts bid distributions to correct systematic errors in analytical mean-field approximations. While analytical predictions assume idealized conditions (uniform distributions, known bid functions), our learned approach adapts to task clustering and spatial heterogeneity. Inspired by Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO), we train predictors end-to-end to minimize Task Allocation Regret rather than prediction error. To scale to large swarms, we develop a mean-field approximation where each robot predicts the distribution of competing bids rather than individual bids, reducing complexity from $O(NT)$ to $O(T)$. We call our approach FORMICA: Field-Oriented Regret-Minimizing Implicit Coordination Algorithm. Experiments show FORMICA substantially outperforms a natural analytical baseline. In scenarios with 16 robots and 64 tasks, our approach improves system reward by 17% and approaches the optimal MILP solution. When deployed on larger scenarios (256 robots, 4096 tasks), the same model improves performance by 7%, demonstrating strong generalization.

However, the DS2D uplink is fundamentally constrained by long propagation distances, severe path loss, and stringent user equipment (UE) power limits, making uplink reliability particularly challenging at low elevation angles and beam edges. This paper investigates the integration of supplementary uplink (SUL) technology into DS2D systems to enhance uplink robustness while preserving UE power efficiency. Leveraging the predictable geometry of LEO satellite orbits, we develop an elevation-aware SUL framework that adapts uplink operation across frequency bands based on elevation-dependent link margin estimates. The proposed approach schedules the UE to transmit on either a primary uplink carrier or a lower-frequency SUL carrier. An elevation-aware SUL activation algorithm with hysteresis is introduced to guide uplink carrier selection while preventing frequent switching. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SUL framework extends effective uplink coverage toward low-elevation and beam-edge regions, improves uplink availability over a satellite pass, and achieves stable operation with a minimal number of uplink transitions under realistic UE power constraints."}

As AI-based scenario generation methods are becoming the mainstream, existing methods (e.g., Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets) mainly rely on a fixed-length numerical conditioning vector to control the generation results, facing challenges in user conveniency and generation flexibility. In this paper, a natural-language-guided scenario generation framework, named LLM-enabled Frequency-aware Flow Diffusion (LFFD), is proposed to enable users to generate desired scenarios using plain human language. First, a pretrained LLM module is introduced to convert generation requests described by unstructured natural languages into ordered semantic space. Second, instead of using standard diffusion models, a flow diffusion model employing a rectified flow matching objective is introduced to achieve efficient and high-quality scenario generation, taking the LLM output as the model input. During the model training process, a frequency-aware multi-objective optimization algorithm is introduced to mitigate the frequency-bias issue.

Closed-loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) schemes address this by introducing end-to-end mappings from actuation to task space for the controller to operate on, but typically assume finite dimensions of the underlying virtual configuration space. In this work, we extend CLIK to the infinite-dimensional domain to reason about the entire soft robot shape while solving tasks. We do this by composing an actuation-to-shape map with a shape-to-task map, deriving the differential end-to-end kinematics via an infinite-dimensional chain rule, and thereby obtaining a Jacobian-based CLIK algorithm. Since the actuation-to-shape mapping is rarely available in closed form, we propose to learn it from simulation data using neural operator networks, which are differentiable. We first present an analytical study on a constant-curvature segment, and then apply the neural version of the algorithm to a three-fiber soft robotic arm whose underlying model relies on morphoelasticity and active filament theory. This opens new possibilities for differentiable control of soft robots by exploiting full-body shape information in a continuous, infinite-dimensional framework."}

In sensor network applications, we often need multiple equally-informative node subsets that are activated sequentially to make a sensor network robust against concentrated battery consumption and sensor failures. In addition, quality of these subsets changes dynamically and thus we must adapt those changes. To find those node subsets, we propose a graph node partitioning method based on sampling theory for graph signals. We aim to minimize the average reconstruction error for signals obtained at all node subsets, in contrast to conventional single subset selection. The graph node partitioning problem is formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization based on a subspace prior of graph signals, and is solved by the proximal DC algorithm. It guarantees convergence to a critical point. To accommodate the online scenario where the signal subspace and optimal partitioning may change over time, we adaptively estimate the signal subspace from historical data and sequentially update the prior for our partitioning method.

Robotic harvesting has emerged as a promising alternative; however, evaluating and training soft grippers for delicate fruits remains difficult due to the highly variable mechanical properties of natural produce. This makes it difficult to establish reliable benchmarks or data-driven control strategies. Existing testing practices rely on large quantities of real fruit to capture this variability, leading to inefficiency, higher costs, and waste. The methodology presented in this work aims to address these limitations by developing tunable soft physical twins that emulate the stiffness characteristics of real fruits at different ripeness levels. A fiber-reinforced pneumatic physical twin of a kiwi fruit was designed and fabricated to replicate the stiffness at different ripeness levels. Experimental results show that the stiffness of the physical twin can be tuned accurately over multiple trials (97.35 - 99.43% accuracy). Gripping tasks with a commercial robotic gripper showed that sensor feedback from the physical twin can reflect the applied gripping forces. Finally, a stress test was performed over 50 cycles showed reliable maintenance of desired stiffness (0.56 - 1.10% error). This work shows promise that robotic physical twins could adjust their stiffness to resemble that of real fruits. This can provide a sustainable, controllable platform for benchmarking and training robotic grippers."}

The commonly used solution is to regulate these environmental conditions to some predefined humidity and temperature levels. However, this approach is often unfeasible or even impossible. Therefore, in this paper we analyzed a dataset of 1,852 DMS measurements of surgical smoke evaporated from porcine adipose and muscle tissue to get an understanding of the impact of varying humidity and temperature on DMS measurements. Our analysis confirmed clear dependence of the measurements on these two factors. To overcome this challenge, we fitted regression models to raw and normalized DMS measurement data. Subsequently, these models were used for estimating DMS measurements for known tissue types based on recorded humidity and temperatures. Our test suggests that it is possible to estimate DMS measurements of surgical smoke from porcine adipose and muscle tissue under specific environmental conditions by standardizing DMS measurements separation voltage-wise and training multivariate regression models on the normalized data, which is the first step in removing the need for standardized measurement conditions."}

HM-MARL was developed to autonomously navigate a guide catheter and guidewire from the femoral artery to the internal carotid artery (ICA). A modular multi-agent approach was used to decompose the complex navigation task into specialized subtasks, each trained using Soft Actor-Critic RL. The framework was validated in both in silico and in vitro testbeds to assess generalization and real-world feasibility. In silico, a single-vasculature model achieved 92-100% success rates on individual anatomies, while a multi-vasculature model achieved 56-80% across multiple patient anatomies.

We propose the BS to use location estimates of the users to reconstruct their line-of-sight (LoS) channel components, hence assisting the AUD process. For this, the BS combines these reconstructed channels with users' pilot sequences, enhancing the correlation between received signals and active users. We formulate the location-aided AUD as a convex optimization problem, solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). {Our proposal has a higher computational complexity compared to the baseline ADMM approach where location information is not used. Moreover, the proposal requires location information of users, which can be readily informed if users are static, or inferred via established localization algorithms if they are mobile.} Simulation results compare our proposal against the baseline across varying systems parameters, such as number of users, pilot length and LoS component strength.

Both open-loop and closed-loop behaviors of a representative ACM are analyzed. The primary objective is to determine the conditions under which the decoupled model attains accuracy comparable to the coupled model while offering reduced computational cost under identical numerical conditions. The system dynamics are first derived using the Euler--Lagrange method under the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption, with explicit treatment of the near-zero curvature singularity. A decoupled model is then obtained by neglecting the coupling terms in the ACM dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of open-loop responses under diverse actuation profiles and external wrenches. To extend the analysis to closed-loop performance, a novel dynamics-based proportional-derivative sliding mode image-based visual servoing (DPD-SM-IBVS) controller is developed for regulating image feature errors in the presence of a moving target. The controller is implemented with both coupled and decoupled models, allowing a direct comparison of their effectiveness. The open-loop simulations reveal pronounced discrepancies between the two modeling approaches, particularly under varying torque inputs and continuum arm parameters. Conversely, the closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the decoupled model achieves tracking accuracy on par with the coupled model (within subpixel error) while incurring lower computational cost."}

In our approach, a high-mobility legged robot serves as a mobile scout, using proprioceptive leg-terrain interactions to estimate regolith strength during locomotion and construct spatially resolved terrain maps. These maps are integrated with rover locomotion models to estimate traversal risk and inform path planning.\n  We validate the framework through analogue missions at the NASA Ames Lunar Simulant Testbed and the White Sands Dune Field.

However, developing and validating these systems in existing simulation frameworks remains challenging due to the computational cost of simulating high-frequency wave propagation in large, dynamic, and complex environments.

Conversely, existing geometric acoustic solvers often lack support for dynamic scenes, complex diffraction, or closed-loop robotic integration. In this work, we introduce SonoTraceUE, a high-fidelity acoustic simulation framework built as a plugin for Unreal Engine. By using a hardware-accelerated ray tracing-based specular reflection model, and a curvature-based Monte Carlo diffraction model, the system enables near real-time simulation of active and passive acoustic sensing in dynamic, multi-material environments. We validate the framework through two distinct experimental domains: a bioacoustic study and a robotics experiment.

To address this, we introduce Collision Learning via Augmented Sim-to-real Hybridization (CLASH), a data-efficient framework that creates a high-fidelity hybrid simulator by learning a surrogate collision model from a minimal set of real-world data. In CLASH, a base model is first distilled from an imperfect simulator (MuJoCo) to capture general physical priors; this model is then fine-tuned with a remarkably small number of real-world interactions (as few as 10 samples) to correct for the simulator's inherent inaccuracies. The resulting hybrid simulator not only achieves higher predictive accuracy but also reduces collision computation time by nearly 50\\%. We demonstrate that policies obtained with our hybrid simulator transfer more robustly to the real world, doubling the success rate in sequential pushing tasks with reinforecement learning and significantly increase the task performance with model-based control."}

Targets whose echoes arrive after this duration induce intersymbol interference (ISI) and associated intercarrier interference (ICI), which significantly degrade detection performance, elevate the interference-noise floor in the radar image, and reduce the useful signal power due to window mismatch. Existing methods face a trade-off between recovering useful signal and suppressing interference, particularly in multi-target scenarios. This paper proposes two frameworks to resolve this dilemma, offering a flexible trade-off between computational cost and target detection performance. First, a signal model is derived, demonstrating that ISI and ICI-oriented interference often dominates thermal noise in high-dynamic-range scenarios. To combat the ISI and ICI-based interference-noise floor increase, joint-interference cancellation with coherent compensation is proposed. This approach is an efficient evolution of the successive-interference cancellation algorithm, utilizing high-precision chirp Z-transform estimation and frequency-domain coherent compensation to recover weak distant targets. For scenarios requiring maximum precision, the full reconstruction-based sliding window scheme is presented, which shifts the receive window to capture optimal signal energy while performing full-signal reconstruction for all detected targets. Numerical results show that both methods outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks."}

Learning-based control is effective in handling complex dynamics and represents the problem as a hybrid action space unifying discrete resource usage and continuous maneuvers. However, prior works on hybrid action space have not sufficiently captured the causal dependencies between resource usage and maneuvers. They have also overlooked the multi-modal nature of tactical decisions, both of which are critical in fast-evolving scenarios. In this paper, we propose TART, a Temporal Action Representation learning framework for Tactical resource control and subsequent maneuver generation. TART leverages contrastive learning based on a mutual information objective, designed to capture inherent temporal dependencies in resource-maneuver interactions. These learned representations are quantized into discrete codebook entries that condition the policy, capturing recurring tactical patterns and enabling multi-modal and temporally coherent behaviors. We evaluate TART in two domains where resource deployment is critical: (i) a maze navigation task where a limited budget of discrete actions provides enhanced mobility, and (ii) a high-fidelity air combat simulator in which an F-16 agent operates weapons and defensive systems in coordination with flight maneuvers. Across both domains, TART consistently outperforms hybrid-action baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in leveraging limited resources and producing context-aware subsequent maneuvers."}

To tackle this issue, we introduce RoboCurate, a novel synthetic robot data generation framework that evaluates and filters the quality of annotated actions by comparing them with simulation replay. Specifically, RoboCurate replays the predicted actions in a simulator and assesses action quality by measuring the consistency of motion between the simulator rollout and the generated video. In addition, we unlock observation diversity beyond the available dataset via image-to-image editing and apply action-preserving video-to-video transfer to further augment appearance. We observe RoboCurate's generated data yield substantial relative improvements in success rates compared to using real data only, achieving +70.1% on GR-1 Tabletop (300 demos), +16.1% on DexMimicGen in the pre-training setup, and +179.9% in the challenging real-world ALLEX humanoid dexterous manipulation setting."}

However, bridging the gap between low-level KPI measurements and high-level requirements, such as quality of experience (QoE), requires methods that are both relevant, capturing temporal patterns predictive of user-level outcomes, and interpretable, providing human-readable insights that operators can validate and act upon. This paper introduces conformal signal temporal logic learning (C-STLL), a framework that addresses both requirements. C-STLL leverages signal temporal logic (STL), a formal language for specifying temporal properties of time series, to learn interpretable formulas that distinguish KPI traces satisfying high-level requirements from those that do not. To ensure reliability, C-STLL wraps around existing STL learning algorithms with a conformal calibration procedure based on the Learn Then Test (LTT) framework. This procedure produces a set of STL formulas with formal guarantees: with high probability, the set contains at least one formula achieving a user-specified accuracy level. The calibration jointly optimizes for reliability, formula complexity, and diversity through principled acceptance and stopping rules validated via multiple hypothesis testing. Experiments using the ns-3 network simulator on a mobile gaming scenario demonstrate that C-STLL effectively controls risk below target levels while returning compact, diverse sets of interpretable temporal specifications that relate KPI behavior to QoE outcomes."}

Instead of predicting actions tied to specific robots, we predict the image-space coordinates of the reference trajectory as they would appear in the robot's current view. This creates robot-agnostic visual guidance that easily integrates with local planning. Consequently, our model's predictions provide guidance zero-shot across diverse embodiments. By decoupling perception from action and learning to localize trajectory points rather than imitate behavioral priors, we enable a cross-trajectory training strategy for robustness to viewpoint and camera changes. We outperform state-of-the-art methods by 20-50 percentage points in success rate on conventional forward navigation, achieving 94-98% success rate across diverse sim and real environments. Furthermore, we achieve over 5x improvements on challenging tasks where baselines fail, such as backward traversal.

To address this, we introduce the Productivity-Reliability Plane (PRP), which evaluates performance through Tasks per Hour (TPH) and Mean Time Between Intervention (MTBI) under a continuous-run protocol that demands both high-speed execution and sustained robustness. Habilis-$β$ achieves high performance by integrating language-free pre-training on large-scale play data for robust interaction priors with post-training on cyclic task demonstrations that capture state drift across consecutive task iterations. The system further employs ESPADA for phase-adaptive motion shaping to accelerate free-space transit, utilizes rectified-flow distillation to enable high-frequency control on edge devices, and incorporates classifier-free guidance (CFG) as a deployment-time knob to dynamically balance instruction adherence and learned interaction priors. In 1-hour continuous-run evaluations, Habilis-$β$ achieves strong performance under the PRP metrics, compared to $π_{0.5}$ in both simulation and real-world environments.

Theoretically, wireless channels may exhibit variations over wavelength distances. In the sub-THz band, close-to-millimeter wavelengths thus require extremely large computational efforts for ray-tracing modeling. However, in practice, channel characteristics may remain quantitatively similar over much larger distances, which can drastically decrease computational efforts. The aim of this study is to experimentally characterize the degree of spatial consistency in sub-THz channel characteristics. To this end, we performed a large-scale measurement campaign in the 140-150 GHz frequency band in an indoor-hall (InH) environment and characterized the channel at separation distances from 2.5 mm up to 1 m. Our results show that channel characteristics including delay spread, angular delay spread, and K-factor change only slightly over multiple tens of centimeter distances. This implies that, in the considered InH environment, the mesh grid can be in the range of 10-50 wavelengths (at 145 GHz) along stable line-of-sight (LoS) directions, while a finer resolution is needed in regions not dominated by LoS.

Despite these risks, the joint protection of sensing and communication security in ISAC systems remains unexplored. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a two-layer dual-secure ISAC framework that simultaneously protects sensing and communication against passive sensing Eves and communication Eves, without requiring their channel state information (CSI). Specifically, transmit beamformers are jointly designed to inject artificial noise (AN) to introduce interference to communication Eves, while deliberately distorting the reference signal available to sensing Eves to impair their sensing capability. Furthermore, the proposed design generates artificial ghosts (AGs) with fake angle-range-velocity profiles observable by all receivers. Legitimate receivers can suppress these AGs, whereas sensing Eves cannot, thereby significantly reducing their probability of correctly detecting the true targets. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively enhances both communication and sensing security, while preserving the performance of communication users and legitimate sensing receivers."}

Robotic automation presents a compelling approach to this challenge by accelerating the sorting process through automated contaminant removal. Still, the diverse and unpredictable nature of contaminants creates major challenges for robotic grasping. Benchmarking frameworks are critical for evaluating challenges from various perspectives. However, existing protocols rely on limited simulation datasets, prioritise simple metrics such as success rate, and overlook key object and environment-related pre-grasp conditions. This paper introduces GRAB, a comprehensive Grasping Real-World Article Benchmarking framework that addresses this gap by integrating diverse deformable objects, advanced grasp-pose-estimation vision, and, importantly, pre-grasp conditions, establishing a set of critical graspability metrics. It systematically compares industrial grasping modalities through an in-depth experimental evaluation involving 1,750 food contaminant grasp attempts across four high-fidelity scenes. This large-scale evaluation provides an extensive assessment of grasp performance for food waste sorting, offering a level of depth that has rarely been explored in previous studies. The results reveal distinct gripper strengths and limitations, with object quality emerging as the dominant performance factor in cluttered environments, while vision quality and clutter levels play moderate roles.

Previously, PFL has been shown to be naturally resistant to backdoor attack propagation across clients. In this work, we reveal that PFL remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks through a novel frequency-domain approach. We propose DCInject, an adaptive frequency-domain backdoor attack for PFL, which removes portions of the zero-frequency (DC) component and replaces them with Gaussian-distributed samples in the frequency domain. Our attack achieves superior attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy across four datasets (CIFAR-10/100, GTSRB, SVHN) compared to existing spatial-domain attacks, evaluated under parameter decoupling based personalization. DCInject achieves superior performance with ASRs of 96.83% (CIFAR-10), 99.38% (SVHN), and 100% (GTSRB) while maintaining clean accuracy. Under I-BAU defense, DCInject demonstrates strong persistence, retaining 90.30% ASR vs BadNet's 58.56% on VGG-16, exposing critical vulnerabilities in PFL security assumptions.

This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based musculoskeletal simulation framework to (1) quantify how progressive unilateral muscle weakness affects gait symmetry and (2) evaluate whether ankle exoskeleton assistance can improve gait symmetry under impaired conditions. The overarching goal is to establish a simulation- and learning-based workflow that supports early controller development prior to patient experiments. Asymmetric gait was induced by reducing right-leg muscle strength to 75%, 50%, and 25% of baseline. Gait asymmetry was quantified using toe-off timing, peak contact forces, and joint-level symmetry metrics. Increasing weakness produced progressively larger temporal and kinematic asymmetry, most pronounced at the ankle. Ankle range of motion symmetry degraded from near-symmetric behavior at 100% strength (symmetry index, SI = +6.4%; correlation r=0.974) to severe asymmetry at 25% strength (SI = -47.1%, r=0.889), accompanied by a load shift toward the unimpaired limb. At 50% strength, ankle exoskeleton assistance improved kinematic symmetry relative to the unassisted impaired condition, reducing the magnitude of ankle SI from 25.8% to 18.5% and increasing ankle correlation from r=0.948 to 0.966, although peak loading remained biased toward the unimpaired side. Overall, this framework supports controlled evaluation of impairment severity and assistive strategies, and provides a basis for future validation in human experiments."}

However, traditional digital hardware for machine learning is power intensive, motivating the need for alternative computation paradigms. Over-The-Air (OTA) computation is regarded as an emerging transformative approach assigning the wireless channel to actively perform computational tasks. This article introduces the concept of Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Networks (MINNs), a physical-layer-enabled deep learning framework that leverages programmable multi-layer metasurface structures and Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels to realize computational layers in the wave propagation domain. The MINN system is conceptualized as three modules: Encoder, Channel (uncontrollable propagation features and metasurfaces), and Decoder. The first and last modules, realized respectively at the multi-antenna transmitter and receiver, consist of conventional digital or purposely designed analog Deep Neural Network (DNN) layers, and the metasurfaces responses of the Channel module are optimized alongside all modules as trainable weights. This architecture enables computation offloading into the end-to-end physical layer, flexibly among its constituent modules, achieving performance comparable to fully digital DNNs while significantly reducing power consumption. The training of the MINN framework, two representative variations, and performance results for indicative applications are presented, highlighting the potential of MINNs as a lightweight and sustainable solution for future EI-enabled wireless systems. The article is concluded with a list of open challenges and promising research directions."}

Existing studies on MiLAC-aided communications rely on idealized channel models and neglect antenna mutual coupling. However, since MiLAC performs processing at RF, mutual coupling becomes critical and alters the implemented operation, not only the channel characteristics. In this paper, we develop a physics-compliant model for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems accounting for mutual coupling with multiport network theory. We derive end-to-end system models for scenarios with MiLACs at the transmitter, the receiver, or both, showing how mutual coupling impacts the linear transformation implemented by the MiLACs. Furthermore, we formulate and solve a mutual coupling aware MiLAC optimization problem, deriving a closed-form globally optimal solution that maximizes the received signal power. We establish the fundamental performance limits of MiLAC with mutual coupling, and derive three analytical results. First, mutual coupling is beneficial in MiLAC-aided systems, on average. Second, with mutual coupling, MiLAC performs as digital architectures equipped with a matching network, while having fewer RF chains. Third, with mutual coupling, MiLAC always outperforms digital architectures with no matching network. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical findings."}

Here, we present TactEx, an explainable multimodal robotic interaction framework that unifies vision, touch, and language for human-like hardness estimation and interactive guidance. We evaluate TactEx on fruit-ripeness assessment, a representative task that requires both tactile sensing and contextual understanding. The system fuses GelSight-Mini tactile streams with RGB observations and language prompts. A ResNet50+LSTM model estimates hardness from sequential tactile data, while a cross-modal alignment module combines visual cues with guidance from a large language model (LLM). This explainable multimodal interface allows users to distinguish ripeness levels with statistically significant class separation (p < 0.01 for all fruit pairs). For touch placement, we compare YOLO with Grounded-SAM (GSAM) and find GSAM to be more robust for fine-grained segmentation and contact-site selection. A lightweight LLM parses user instructions and produces grounded natural-language explanations linked to the tactile outputs. In end-to-end evaluations, TactEx attains 90% task success on simple user queries and generalises to novel tasks without large-scale tuning. These results highlight the promise of combining pretrained visual and tactile models with language grounding to advance explainable, human-like touch perception and decision-making in robotics."}

Prevailing approaches treat it as a static regression problem, processing each EEG window in isolation and ignoring the rich temporal structure inherent in continuous speech. This study introduces a new, dynamic framework for envelope reconstruction that leverages this structure as a predictive temporal prior. We propose a state-space fusion model that combines direct neural estimates from EEG with predictions from recent speech context, using a learned gating mechanism to adaptively balance these cues. To validate this approach, we evaluate our model on the ICASSP 2023 Stimulus Reconstruction benchmark demonstrating significant improvements over static, EEG-only baselines. Our analyses reveal a powerful synergy between the neural and temporal information streams.

It leverages environmental interaction as a form of embodied control, where low-level stabilisation and near-obstacle navigation emerge from the passive dynamic responses of the drone-obstacle system that resembles a mass-spring-damper system. Experiments show that the elastic horn can absorb impact energy while maintaining vehicle stability, reducing pitch oscillations by 38% compared to the rigid horn configuration. The lower horn arrangement was found to reduce pitch oscillations by approximately 54%. In addition to intermittent contact, the platform equipped with elastic horns also demonstrates stable, sustained contact with static objects, relying on a standard attitude PID controller."}

These constraints hinder real-time communication and degrade overall system performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a bilevel Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework. At the fast inner level, a Contextual Delayed MAB (CD-MAB) jointly optimizes adaptive modulation and transmission power based on both channel state feedback and its Age of Information (AoI), thereby maximizing throughput. At the slower outer level, a Feedback Scheduling MAB dynamically adjusts the channel-state feedback interval according to throughput dynamics: stable throughput allows longer update intervals, while throughput drops trigger more frequent updates. This adaptive mechanism reduces feedback overhead and enhances responsiveness to varying network conditions. The proposed bilevel framework is computationally efficient and well-suited to resource-constrained UWA networks.

We found that users were drawn to robotaxis by low cost, social recommendation, and curiosity. They valued a distinctive set of benefits, such as an increased sense of agency, and consistent driving behavioral consistency and standardized ride experiences. However, they encountered persistent challenges around limited flexibility, insufficient transparency, management difficulty, robustness concerns in edge cases, and emergency handling concerns. Robotaxi experiences were shaped by privacy, safety, ethics, and trust. Users were often privacy-indifferent yet sensitive to opaque access and leakage risks; safety perceptions were polarized; and ethical considerations surfaced round issues such as accountability, feedback responsibility and absence of human-like social norms. Based on these findings, we propose a user-driven design framework spanning the end-to-end journey, such as pre-ride configuration (hailing), context-aware pickup facilitation (pick-up) in-ride explainability (traveling), and accountable post-ride feedback (drop-off) to guide robotaxi interaction and service design."}

This paper proposes a distributed collaborative visual-inertial-ranging odometry (DC-VIRO) framework that tightly fuses VIO and UWB measurements across multiple robots. Anchor positions are explicitly included in the system state to address calibration uncertainty, while shared anchor observations are exploited through inter-robot communication to provide additional geometric constraints.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel ``Human-to-Robot'' imitation learning pipeline that enables robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from unstructured video demonstrations, inspired by the human ability to learn by watching and imitating. Our key innovation is a modular framework that decouples the learning process into two distinct stages: (1) Video Understanding, which combines Temporal Shift Modules (TSM) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract actions and identify interacted objects, and (2) Robot Imitation, which employs TD3-based deep reinforcement learning to execute the demonstrated manipulations.

In this work, we propose a unified pushing policy that incorporates a lightweight prompting mechanism into a flow matching policy to guide the generation of reactive, multimodal pushing actions. The visual prompt can be specified by a high-level planner, enabling the reuse of the pushing policy across a wide range of planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified pushing policy not only outperforms existing baselines but also effectively serves as a low-level primitive within a VLM-guided planning framework to solve table-cleaning tasks efficiently."}

However, their effectiveness and efficiency on structured, long-horizon manipulation tasks remain unclear. In this work, we present a head-to-head empirical comparison between a fine-tuned open-weight VLA model π0 and a neuro-symbolic architecture that combines PDDL-based symbolic planning with learned low-level control. We evaluate both approaches on structured variants of the Towers of Hanoi manipulation task in simulation while measuring both task performance and energy consumption during training and execution. On the 3-block task, the neuro-symbolic model achieves 95% success compared to 34% for the best-performing VLA. The neuro-symbolic model also generalizes to an unseen 4-block variant (78% success), whereas both VLAs fail to complete the task. During training, VLA fine-tuning consumes nearly two orders of magnitude more energy than the neuro-symbolic approach. These results highlight important trade-offs between end-to-end foundation-model approaches and structured reasoning architectures for long-horizon robotic manipulation, emphasizing the role of explicit symbolic structure in improving reliability, data efficiency, and energy efficiency.

Contrary to existing vision-based control algorithms in the literature that regulate the robot's end effector pose, our proposed control algorithm regulates the robot's whole body configuration, enabling us to leverage its kinematic redundancy. Additionally, our model-based 2.5D shape visual servoing provides globally stable asymptotic convergence in the robot's 3D workspace compared to the closest works in the literature that report local minima. Unlike existing visual servoing algorithms in the literature, our approach does not require information from proprioceptive sensors, making it suitable for continuum manipulators without such capabilities. Instead, robot state is estimated from images acquired by an external camera that observes the robot's whole body shape and is also utilized to close the shape control loop. Traditionally, visual servoing schemes require an image of the robot at its reference pose to generate the reference features. In this work, we utilize an inverse kinematics solver to generate reference features for the desired robot configuration and do not require images of the robot at the reference. Experiments are performed on a multisection continuum manipulator demonstrating the controller's capability to regulate the robot's whole body shape while precisely positioning the robot's end effector. Results validate our controller's ability to regulate the shape of continuum robots while demonstrating a smooth transient response and a steady-state error within 1 mm. Proof-of-concept object manipulation experiments including stacking, pouring, and pulling tasks are performed to demonstrate our controller's applicability."}

In scenarios where agents cannot confidently predict one another's intentions and plans, language communication can be crucial for ensuring safety. In this work, we focus on path-level cooperation in which agents must adapt their paths to one another in order to avoid collisions or perform physical collaboration such as joint carrying. In particular, we propose a safe and interpretable multimodal path planning method, CaPE (Code as Path Editor), which generates and updates path plans for an agent based on the environment and language communication from other agents. CaPE leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to synthesize a path editing program verified by a model-based planner, grounding communication to path plan updates in a safe and interpretable way. We evaluate our approach in diverse simulated and real-world scenarios, including multi-robot and human-robot cooperation in autonomous driving, household, and joint carrying tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CaPE can be integrated into different robotic systems as a plug-and-play module, greatly enhancing a robot's ability to align its plan to language communication from other robots or humans.

In such settings, relying solely on geometric frontiers for exploration is often insufficient. In such settings, the ability to reason semantically about where to go and what is safe to traverse is crucial for robust, efficient exploration. This work presents WildOS, a unified system for long-range, open-vocabulary object search that combines safe geometric exploration with semantic visual reasoning. WildOS builds a sparse navigation graph to maintain spatial memory, while utilizing a foundation-model-based vision module, ExploRFM, to score frontier nodes of the graph. ExploRFM simultaneously predicts traversability, visual frontiers, and object similarity in image space, enabling real-time, onboard semantic navigation tasks. The resulting vision-scored graph enables the robot to explore semantically meaningful directions while ensuring geometric safety. Furthermore, we introduce a particle-filter-based method for coarse localization of the open-vocabulary target query, that estimates candidate goal positions beyond the robot's immediate depth horizon, enabling effective planning toward distant goals. Extensive closed-loop field experiments across diverse off-road and urban terrains demonstrate that WildOS enables robust navigation, significantly outperforming purely geometric and purely vision-based baselines in both efficiency and autonomy.

Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap, yet existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model.

Although stakeholders are calling for tools to manage increasingly large fleets of gliders, successful autonomous long-term deployments have thus far been scarce, which hints at a lack of suitable methodologies and systems. In this work, we formulate glider navigation planning as a stochastic shortest-path Markov Decision Process and propose a sample-based online planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. Samples are generated by a physics-informed simulator that captures uncertain execution of controls and ocean current forecasts while remaining computationally tractable. The simulator parameters are fitted using historical glider data. We integrate these methods into an autonomous command-and-control system for Slocum gliders that enables closed-loop replanning at each surfacing.

However, existing modular magnetic platforms often depend on workspace collisions for reconfiguration, employ bulky three-dimensional electromagnetic systems, and lack robust single-module control, which limits their applicability in biomedical settings. In this work, we present a modular magnetic millirobotic platform comprising three cube-shaped modules with embedded permanent magnets, each designed for a distinct functional role: a free module that supports self-assembly and reconfiguration, a fixed module that enables flip-and-walk locomotion, and a gripper module for cargo manipulation. Locomotion and reconfiguration are actuated by programmable combinations of time-varying two-dimensional uniform and gradient magnetic field inputs. Experiments demonstrate closed-loop navigation using real-time vision feedback and A* path planning, establishing robust single-module control capabilities. Beyond locomotion, the system achieves self-assembly, multimodal transformations, and disassembly at low field strengths. Chain-to-gripper transformations succeeded in 90% of trials, while chain-to-square transformations were less consistent, underscoring the role of module geometry in reconfiguration reliability. These results establish a versatile modular robotic platform capable of multimodal behavior and robust control, suggesting a promising pathway toward scalable and adaptive task execution in confined environments."}

When sensing is limited to external cameras, the problem is further compounded by perception noise and the absence of direct force or state measurements. We present Vid2Sid, a video-driven system identification pipeline that couples foundation-model perception with a VLM-in-the-loop optimizer that analyzes paired sim-real videos, diagnoses concrete mismatches, and proposes physics parameter updates with natural language rationales. We evaluate our approach on a tendon-actuated finger (rigid-body dynamics in MuJoCo) and a deformable continuum tentacle (soft-body dynamics in PyElastica). On sim2real holdout controls unseen during training, Vid2Sid achieves the best average rank across all settings, matching or exceeding black-box optimizers while uniquely providing interpretable reasoning at each iteration. Sim2sim validation confirms that Vid2Sid recovers ground-truth parameters most accurately (mean relative error under 13\\% vs. 28--98\\%), and ablation analysis reveals three calibration regimes. VLM-guided optimization excels when perception is clean and the simulator is expressive, while model-class limitations bound performance in more challenging settings."}

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a general perceive-reason-act framework for this goal. However, previous approaches using reflective planning to guide VLMs in correcting actions encounter significant limitations. These methods rely on inefficient and often inaccurate implicit learning of state-values from noisy foresight predictions, evaluate only a single greedy future, and suffer from substantial inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel test-time computation framework that decouples state evaluation from action generation. This provides a more direct and fine-grained supervisory signal for robust decision-making. Our method explicitly models the advantage of an action plan, quantified by its reduction in distance to the goal, and uses a scalable critic to estimate. To address the stochastic nature of single-trajectory evaluation, we employ beam search to explore multiple future paths and aggregate them during decoding to model their expected long-term returns, leading to more robust action generation. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight, confidence-based trigger that allows for early exit when direct predictions are reliable, invoking reflection only when necessary. Extensive experiments on diverse, unseen multi-stage robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate a 24.6% improvement in success rate over state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly reducing inference time by 56.5%."}

Namely, we prove the Bellman Value for a complex task defined in temporal logic can be decomposed into a graph of Bellman Values, connected by a set of well-known Bellman equations (BEs): the Reach-Avoid BE, the Avoid BE, and a novel type, the Reach-Avoid-Loop BE. To solve the Value and optimal policy, we propose VDPPO, which embeds the decomposed Value graph into a two-layer neural net, bootstrapping the implicit dependencies. We conduct a variety of simulated and hardware experiments to test our method on complex, high-dimensional tasks involving heterogeneous teams and nonlinear dynamics. Ultimately, we find this approach greatly improves performance over existing baselines, balancing safety and liveness automatically."}

Decision making algorithms in such partially observable environments have also shown that agents capable of lookahead over a finite horizon outperform myopic policies for active search. Unfortunately, lookahead algorithms typically rely on building a computationally expensive search tree that is simulated and updated based on the agent's observations and a model of the environment dynamics. Instead, in this work, we leverage the sequence modeling abilities of diffusion models to sample lookahead action sequences that balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for active search without building an exhaustive search tree. We identify the optimism bias in prior diffusion based reinforcement learning approaches when applied to the active search setting and propose mitigating solutions for efficient cost-aware decision making with both single and multi-agent teams.

In this framework, measurement models are learned implicitly by minimizing a denoising score matching objective. At inference, the learned denoiser is used alongside a (learned) dynamics model to approximately solve the Bayesian filtering equation at each time step, effectively guiding predicted states toward the data manifold informed by measurements. We evaluate the proposed method on challenging robotic state estimation tasks in simulation, demonstrating competitive performance compared to tuned end-to-end trained baselines.

A Joint denoising objective synchronously synthesizes environmental evolution and action sequences to ensure physical consistency. Achieving success rates of 83.2% and 72.5% in simulation and real-world trials, DeMUSE demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, validating the necessity of deep multi-sensory integration for complex physical interactions."}

While vision-based soft tactile sensors can track internal marker displacements, learning-based models for 3D contact estimation heavily depend on their training datasets, inherently limiting their ability to generalize to complex scenarios such as multi-point sensing. To address this limitation, we introduce TactiVerse, a U-Net-based framework that formulates contact geometry estimation as a spatial heatmap prediction task. Even when trained exclusively on a limited dataset of single-point indentations, our architecture achieves highly accurate single-point sensing, yielding a superior mean absolute error of 0.0589 mm compared to the 0.0612 mm of a conventional regression-based CNN baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the training dataset with multi-point contact data substantially enhances the sensor's multi-point sensing capabilities, significantly improving the overall mean MAE for two-point discrimination from 1.214 mm to 0.383 mm. By successfully extrapolating complex contact geometries from fundamental interactions, this methodology unlocks advanced multi-point and large-area shape sensing. Ultimately, it significantly streamlines the development of marker-based soft sensors, offering a highly scalable solution for real-world tactile perception."}

As the situations encountered and the required capabilities of the robots deployed in such missions differ wildly and are often not known in advance, heterogeneous fleets of robots are needed to cover a wide range of mission requirements. While UAVs can quickly survey the mission environment, their ability to carry heavy payloads such as sensors and manipulators is limited. UGVs can carry required payloads to assess and manipulate the mission environment, but need to be able to deal with difficult and unstructured terrain such as rubble and stairs. The ability of tracked platforms with articulated arms (flippers) to reconfigure their geometry makes them particularly effective for navigating challenging terrain. In this paper, we present Athena, an open-hardware rescue ground robot research platform with four individually reconfigurable flippers and a reliable low-cost remote emergency stop (E-Stop) solution. A novel mounting solution using an industrial PU belt and tooth inserts allows the replacement and testing of different track profiles. The manipulator with a maximum reach of 1.54m can be used to operate doors, valves, and other objects of interest.

However, the performance of these data-driven models fundamentally depends on the trade-off between sample size and model dimensions, a relationship for which the scaling laws have remained unclear. This paper establishes a rigorous framework to address this challenge by deriving and empirically validating scaling laws that connect sample size, latent space dimension, and downstream control quality. We derive a theoretical upper bound on the Koopman approximation error, explicitly decomposing it into sampling error and projection error. We show that these terms decay at specific rates relative to dataset size and latent dimension, providing a rigorous basis for the scaling law. Based on the theoretical results, we introduce two lightweight regularizers for the neural Koopman operator: a covariance loss to help stabilize the learned latent features and an inverse control loss to ensure the model aligns with physical actuation. The results from systematic experiments across six robotic environments confirm that model fitting error follows the derived scaling laws, and the regularizers improve dynamic model fitting fidelity, with enhanced closed-loop control performance. Together, our results provide a simple recipe for allocating effort between data collection and model capacity when learning Koopman dynamics for control."}

Traditional safety approaches enforce fixed constraints in user-specified contexts, limiting their ability to handle the open-ended contextual variability of real-world deployment. We address this gap via CORE, a safety framework that enables online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., maps or safety specifications). CORE uses a vision-language model (VLM) to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules directly from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions. We provide probabilistic safety guarantees for CORE that account for perceptual uncertainty, and we demonstrate through simulation and real-world experiments that CORE enforces contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning. Ablation studies validate our theoretical guarantees and underscore the importance of both VLM-based reasoning and spatial grounding for enforcing contextual safety in novel settings.

However, in real-world scenarios, such as home environments and warehouses, clutter can block all routes. Targeted at such cases, we introduce the Lifelong Interactive Navigation problem, where a mobile robot with manipulation abilities can move clutter to forge its own path to complete sequential object- placement tasks - each involving placing an given object (eg. Alarm clock, Pillow) onto a target object (eg. Dining table, Desk, Bed). To address this lifelong setting - where effects of environment changes accumulate and have long-term effects - we propose an LLM-driven, constraint-based planning framework with active perception. Our framework allows the LLM to reason over a structured scene graph of discovered objects and obstacles, deciding which object to move, where to place it, and where to look next to discover task-relevant information. This coupling of reasoning and active perception allows the agent to explore the regions expected to contribute to task completion rather than exhaustively mapping the environment. A standard motion planner then executes the corresponding navigate-pick-place, or detour sequence, ensuring reliable low-level control. Evaluated in physics-enabled ProcTHOR-10k simulator, our approach outperforms non-learning and learning-based baselines. We further demonstrate our approach qualitatively on real-world hardware."}

Our AdaWorldPolicy integrates a world model, an action expert, and a force predictor-all implemented as interconnected Flow Matching Diffusion Transformers (DiT).

Our method is built on two key technical innovations. First, we leverage the recently introduced shape-differentiable contact model, whose global differentiability permits joint optimization over object geometry and pose while modeling inter-object contacts. Second, we exploit the structured sparsity of the augmented Lagrangian Hessian to derive an efficient linear system solver whose computational cost scales favorably with scene complexity. Building on this formulation, we develop an end-to-end real-to-sim scene estimation pipeline that integrates learning-based object initialization, physics-constrained joint shape-pose optimization, and differentiable texture refinement. Experiments on cluttered scenes with up to 5 objects and 22 convex hulls demonstrate that our approach robustly reconstructs physically valid, simulation-ready object shapes and poses."}

We are motivated by multi-agent tasks of active situational awareness in unknown, partially-observable, and resource-limited environments, where the agents must coordinate through agent-to-agent communication. Our approach enables scalability by (i) limiting information relays to only one-hop communication and (ii) keeping inter-agent messages small, having each agent transmit only its own action information. Despite these information-access restrictions, our approach enables near-optimal action coordination by optimizing the agents' communication neighborhoods over time, through distributed online bandit optimization, subject to the agents' bandwidth constraints. Particularly, our approach enjoys an anytime suboptimality bound that is also strictly positive for arbitrary network topologies, even disconnected. To prove the bound, we define the Value of Coordination (VoC), an information-theoretic metric that quantifies for each agent the benefit of information access to its neighbors.

Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

Furthermore, a Rank-One MIMO architecture is introduced to model the uncertainty-aware Q-function, \\TP{offering the same ability for uncertainty quantification as an ensemble of networks but with a cost nearly equivalent to that of a single network}. Consequently, this framework strikes a harmonious balance between precision, speed, and memory efficiency, culminating in improved overall performance. Extensive experimentation on the D4RL benchmark demonstrates that the framework attains state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally efficient. By incorporating the concept of uncertainty quantification, our framework offers a promising avenue to alleviate extrapolation errors and enhance the efficiency of offline RL."}

Recent studies demonstrate that anchor-guided generative models are effective in modeling the uncertainty of driving behaviors and improving overall performance. However, these methods rely on discrete anchor vocabularies that must sufficiently cover the trajectory distribution during testing to ensure robustness, inducing an inherent trade-off between vocabulary size and model performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose MeanFuser, an end-to-end autonomous driving method that enhances both efficiency and robustness through three key designs. (1) We introduce Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) to guide generative sampling, enabling a continuous representation of the trajectory space and eliminating the dependency on discrete anchor vocabularies. (2) We adapt ``MeanFlow Identity\" to end-to-end planning, which models the mean velocity field between GMN and trajectory distribution instead of the instantaneous velocity field used in vanilla flow matching methods, effectively eliminating numerical errors from ODE solvers and significantly accelerating inference. (3) We design a lightweight Adaptive Reconstruction Module (ARM) that enables the model to implicitly select from all sampled proposals or reconstruct a new trajectory when none is satisfactory via attention weights. Experiments on the NAVSIM closed-loop benchmark demonstrate that MeanFuser achieves outstanding performance without the supervision of the PDM Score. and exceptional inference efficiency, offering a robust and efficient solution for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/wjl2244/MeanFuser."}

However, the existence of a CBF is only a sufficient condition for system safety. The recently proposed Taylor-Lagrange Control (TLC) method addresses this limitation, but is vulnerable to the feasibility preservation problem (e.g., inter-sampling effect). In this paper, we propose a robust TLC (rTLC) method to address the feasibility preservation problem. Specifically, the rTLC method expands the safety function at an order higher than the relative degree of the function using Taylor's expansion with Lagrange remainder, which allows the control to explicitly show up at the current time instead of the future time in the TLC method. The rTLC method naturally addresses the feasibility preservation problem with only one hyper-parameter (the discretization time interval size during implementation), which is much less than its counterparts. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed rTLC method through an adaptive cruise control problem, and compare it with existing safety-critical control methods."}

Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning. The data, benchmark toolkit, and models are publicly available at https://video-reason.com/ ."}
