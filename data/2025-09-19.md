### [1] [In Planta Tattoo and Kirigami Sensors for Self-Powered Monitoring of Vapor Pressure Deficit and Growth Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14240)
*Nafize Ishtiaque Hossain,Kundan Saha,Atul Sharma,Sameer Sonkusale*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 一种可扩展的自供电植物传感器平台，用于持续监测植物水分和生长，集成叶面纹身传感器和茎干应变传感器，实现自主供电和长期监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种无需外部电源、可持续监测植物水分和生长的传感器，以改善农业管理并监测非生物胁迫。

Method: 结合叶面纹身传感器（测量温湿度并利用水分发电）和茎干应变传感器（跟踪茎干生长），采用无洁净室制造方法。

Result: 纹身传感器提供0.1114微瓦/平方厘米的功率密度，可持续工作10天；应变传感器可持续监测20天。

Conclusion: 平台具有大规模农业应用的潜力，可提升作物管理和非生物胁迫监测能力。

Abstract: We report a scalable, self-powered in planta sensor platform for continuous
monitoring of plant hydration and growth. The system integrates two components
a leaf mounted tattoo sensor for estimating vapor pressure deficit and a
kirigami inspired strain sensor for tracking radial stem growth. Uniquely, the
tattoo sensor serves a dual function measuring temperature and humidity beneath
the leaf surface while simultaneously harvesting power from ambient moisture
via a vanadium pentoxide nanosheet membrane. This moist-electric generator
configuration enables energy-autonomous operation, delivering a power density
of 0.1114 miroW per square cm. The V2O5 based sensor exhibits high sensitivity
to humidity and temperature, enabling accurate VPD estimation for over 10 days
until leaf senescence. The eutectogel based kirigami strain sensor, wrapped
around the stem, offers a gauge factor of 1.5 and immunity to unrelated
mechanical disturbances, allowing continuous growth tracking for more than 20
days. Both sensors are fabricated via cleanroom-free, roll to roll compatible
methods, underscoring their potential for large-scale agricultural deployment
to monitor abiotic stress and improve crop management.

### [2] [Artificial Intelligence-derived Cardiotocography Age as a Digital Biomarker for Predicting Future Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14242)
*Jinshuai Gu,Zenghui Lin,Jingying Ma,Jingyu Wang,Linyan Zhang,Rui Bai,Zelin Tu,Youyou Jiang,Donglin Xie,Yuxi Zhou,Guoli Liu,Shenda Hong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种基于CTG数据的AI模型（CTGage），通过计算预测与实际年龄的差距（CTGage-gap），作为预测不良妊娠结局的新数字生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CTG预测未来不良妊娠结局的潜力，填补当前仅用于评估胎儿即时状态的局限性。

Method: 使用61,140条CTG记录，设计1D卷积神经网络模型，结合分布对齐增强回归技术，将CTGage-gap分为五组分析风险。

Result: CTGage平均绝对误差10.91天，高风险组（过高或过低估计）的不良妊娠结局和母体疾病发生率显著高于正常组。

Conclusion: CTGage是一种新型、非侵入性且易获取的数字生物标志物，能够预测不良妊娠风险。

Abstract: Cardiotocography (CTG) is a low-cost, non-invasive fetal health assessment
technique used globally, especially in underdeveloped countries. However, it is
currently mainly used to identify the fetus's current status (e.g., fetal
acidosis or hypoxia), and the potential of CTG in predicting future adverse
pregnancy outcomes has not been fully explored. We aim to develop an AI-based
model that predicts biological age from CTG time series (named CTGage), then
calculate the age gap between CTGage and actual age (named CTGage-gap), and use
this gap as a new digital biomarker for future adverse pregnancy outcomes. The
CTGage model is developed using 61,140 records from 11,385 pregnant women,
collected at Peking University People's Hospital between 2018 and 2022. For
model training, a structurally designed 1D convolutional neural network is
used, incorporating distribution-aligned augmented regression technology. The
CTGage-gap is categorized into five groups: < -21 days (underestimation group),
-21 to -7 days, -7 to 7 days (normal group), 7 to 21 days, and > 21 days
(overestimation group). We further defined the underestimation group and
overestimation group together as the high-risk group. We then compare the
incidence of adverse outcomes and maternal diseases across these groups. The
average absolute error of the CTGage model is 10.91 days. When comparing the
overestimation group with the normal group, premature infants incidence is
5.33% vs. 1.42% (p < 0.05) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence is
31.93% vs. 20.86% (p < 0.05). When comparing the underestimation group with the
normal group, low birth weight incidence is 0.17% vs. 0.15% (p < 0.05) and
anaemia incidence is 37.51% vs. 34.74% (p < 0.05). Artificial
intelligence-derived CTGage can predict the future risk of adverse pregnancy
outcomes and hold potential as a novel, non-invasive, and easily accessible
digital biomarker.

### [3] [InWaveSR: Topography-Aware Super-Resolution Network for Internal Solitary Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14243)
*Xinjie Wang,Zhongrui Li,Peng Han,Chunxin Yuan,Jiexin Xu,Zhiqiang Wei,Jie Nie*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的时空超分辨率模型InWaveSR，用于从低分辨率观测数据生成高分辨率数据，特别是在处理内孤立波（ISWs）时表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测数据的分辨率不足限制了其有效利用，因此需要一种能够生成高分辨率数据并保持物理一致性的方法。

Method: InWaveSR结合了物理约束（Navier-Stokes方程）、HF-ResBlock组件（注意力机制和FFT）以及边缘采样和数值预处理技术，以提高模型性能。

Result: 在实测ISW数据上，InWaveSR的PSNR得分为36.2，优于传统插值方法和之前神经网络。

Conclusion: InWaveSR在高分辨率ISW重建中表现出卓越的性能和可靠性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: The effective utilization of observational data is frequently hindered by
insufficient resolution. To address this problem, we present a new
spatio-temporal super-resolution (STSR) model, called InWaveSR. It is built on
a deep learning framework with physical restrictions and can efficiently
generate high-resolution data from low-resolution input, especially for data
featuring internal solitary waves (ISWs). To increase generality and
interpretation, the model InWaveSR uses the primitive Navier-Stokes equations
as the constraint, ensuring that the output results are physically consistent.
In addition, the proposed model incorporates an HF-ResBlock component that
combines the attention mechanism and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method to
improve the performance of the model in capturing high-frequency
characteristics. Simultaneously, in order to enhance the adaptability of the
model to complicated bottom topography, an edge sampling and numerical
pre-processing method are carried out to optimize the training process. On
evaluations using the in-situ observational ISW data, the proposed InWaveSR
achieved a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) score of 36.2, higher than those
of the traditional interpolation method and the previous neural network. This
highlights its significant superiority over traditional methods, demonstrating
its excellent performance and reliability in high-resolution ISW
reconstruction.

### [4] [Conditional Nearest Level Modulation for Improved Switching Dynamics in Asymmetric Multilevel Converters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14402)
*Jinshui Zhang,Angel V Peterchev,Stefan M Goetz*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种条件最近电平调制（cNLM）方法，通过数学惩罚模型调节开关动态，提高了输出质量并降低了开关率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模块化多电平转换器在清洁能源等领域有广泛应用，但需要大量模块以实现精细输出。非对称多电平电路中，输出电平数量随模块数指数增长，传统NLM方法可能导致开关过度和电压尖峰。

Method: 引入条件最近电平调制（cNLM），结合数学惩罚模型调节开关动态，并提供针对特定功能的cNLM变体。

Result: 实验验证表明，cNLM将总输出失真从66.3%降至15.1%，开关率降至原始NLM的8%。

Conclusion: cNLM有效改善了输出电压质量并显著降低了开关率，适用于非对称多电平电路。

Abstract: Modular multilevel converters have promising applications in clean energy,
electric vehicles, and biomedical instrumentation, but need many modules to
achieve fine output granularity, particularly of the voltage. Asymmetric
multilevel circuits introduce differences in module voltages so that the
quantity of output levels grows exponentially with the number of modules.
Nearest-level modulation (NLM) is preferred over carrier-based methods in
asymmetric circuits for its simplicity. However, the large number of output
levels can overwhelm NLM and cause excessive transistor switching on some
modules and output voltage spikes. We propose a conditional nearest-level
modulation (cNLM) by incorporating mathematical penalty models to regulate
switching dynamics. This approach improves output quality and reduces switching
rates. Additionally, we present cNLM variations tailored for specific
functions, such as enforcing a minimum switching interval. Experimental
validation on an asymmetric multilevel prototype demonstrates that cNLM reduces
the total output distortion from 66.3% to 15.1% while cutting the switching
rate to just 8% of the original NLM.

### [5] [Indoor Airflow Imaging Using Physics-Informed Background-Oriented Schlieren Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14442)
*Arjun Teh,Wael H. Ali,Joshua Rapp,Hassan Mansour*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单视角BOS测量和物理信息重建的非侵入式室内气流体积估计框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角BOS层析成像严重不适定问题。

Method: 改进光线追踪、物理渲染和损失公式，结合PINN进行物理正则化。

Result: 实现了与浮力驱动流控制方程一致的气流重建。

Conclusion: 框架通过物理约束提高了单视角BOS在气流重建中的准确性。

Abstract: We develop a framework for non-invasive volumetric indoor airflow estimation
from a single viewpoint using background-oriented schlieren (BOS) measurements
and physics-informed reconstruction. Our framework utilizes a light projector
that projects a pattern onto a target back-wall and a camera that observes
small distortions in the light pattern. While the single-view BOS tomography
problem is severely ill-posed, our proposed framework addresses this using: (1)
improved ray tracing, (2) a physics-based light rendering approach and loss
formulation, and (3) a physics-based regularization using a physics-informed
neural network (PINN) to ensure that the reconstructed airflow is consistent
with the governing equations for buoyancy-driven flows.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种在线SNN解码器，通过局部三因子学习规则和双时间尺度资格迹实现高效实时神经解码，减少内存占用且性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑机接口中神经信号不稳定和实时植入应用内存受限的挑战。

Method: 采用在线SNN解码器，结合错误调制的Hebbian更新、快/慢迹整合和自适应学习率控制，仅需O(1)内存。

Result: 在灵长类数据集上实现与传统方法相当的解码精度（Pearson R≥0.63和R≥0.81），内存减少28-35%，收敛更快。

Conclusion: 该方法适合资源受限的植入式BCI系统，支持内存高效且持续自适应的神经解码。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces face challenges from neural signal instability and
memory constraints for real-time implantable applications. We introduce an
online SNN decoder using local three-factor learning rules with dual-timescale
eligibility traces that avoid backpropagation through time while maintaining
competitive performance. Our approach combines error-modulated Hebbian updates,
fast/slow trace consolidation, and adaptive learning rate control, requiring
only O(1) memory versus O(T) for BPTT methods. Evaluations on two primate
datasets achieve comparable decoding accuracy (Pearson $R \geq 0.63$ Zenodo, $R
\geq 0.81$ MC Maze) with 28-35% memory reduction and faster convergence than
BPTT-trained SNNs. Closed-loop simulations with synthetic neural populations
demonstrate adaptation to neural disruptions and learning from scratch without
offline calibration. This work enables memory-efficient, continuously adaptive
neural decoding suitable for resource-constrained implantable BCI systems.

### [7] [Secure Blind Graph Signal Recovery and Adversary Detection Using Smoothness Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14449)
*Mahdi Shamsi,Hadi Zayyani,Hasan Abu Hilal,Mohammad Salman*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种安全的盲图信号恢复（GSR）算法，能检测敌对节点，恢复信号并应对虚假数据注入（FDI）和测量噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图中敌对节点位置和数量未知的情况下，解决信号恢复和安全的挑战性问题。

Method: 基于差分平滑度的统计检测器识别敌对节点，采用平滑度最大化变体进行GSR，通过Dinkelbach算法高效求解分数优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在信号恢复上优于中值GSR算法和其他竞争方法。

Conclusion: 所提算法是安全GSR的有效解决方案，兼具低复杂度和高效性。

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a secure blind Graph Signal Recovery (GSR)
algorithm that can detect adversary nodes. Some unknown adversaries are assumed
to be injecting false data at their respective nodes in the graph. The number
and location of adversaries are not known in advance and the goal is to recover
the graph signal in the presence of measurement noise and False Data Injection
(FDI) caused by the adversaries. Consequently, the proposed algorithm would be
a perfect candidate to solve this challenging problem. Moreover, due to the
presence of malicious nodes, the proposed method serves as a secure GSR
algorithm. For adversary detection, a statistical measure based on differential
smoothness is used. Specifically, the difference between the current observed
smoothness and the average smoothness excluding the corresponding node. This
genuine statistical approach leads to an effective and low-complexity adversary
detector. In addition, following malicious node detection, the GSR is performed
using a variant of smoothness maximization, which is solved efficiently as a
fractional optimization problem using a Dinkelbach's algorithm. Analysis of the
detector, which determines the optimum threshold of the detector is also
presented. Simulation results show a significant improvement of the proposed
method in signal recovery compared to the median GSR algorithm and other
competing methods.

*Zhongwen Sun,Wei Chen,Yuxuan Sun,Bo Ai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了6G环境下物联网（IoT）中两种不同类型流量的非正交无授权随机接入（GF-RA）场景，提出了一种基于年龄的优化方法，同时提高警报设备（ADs）的检测成功率和监测设备（MDs）的信息时效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GF-RA研究主要关注用户检测和数据恢复的准确性，未考虑流量的异构性。本文旨在同时满足ADs的高检测成功率和MDs的高信息时效性。

Method: 1. 分析并优化基于年龄的随机接入方案以减少MDs的平均信息年龄（AoI）。2. 设计基于年龄的先验信息辅助自动编码器（A-PIAAE），利用学习到的导频减少非正交导频间的干扰。3. 在解码器中提出Age-based LISTA算法（LISTA-AGE），利用MDs的AoI作为先验信息增强用户检测。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了GF-RA中流量异构性问题，同时优化了ADs的检测性能和MDs的信息时效性。

Abstract: With the arrival of 6G, the Internet of Things (IoT) traffic is becoming more
and more complex and diverse. To meet the diverse service requirements of IoT
devices, massive machine-type communications (mMTC) becomes a typical scenario,
and more recently, grant-free random access (GF-RA) presents a promising
direction due to its low signaling overhead. However, existing GF-RA research
primarily focuses on improving the accuracy of user detection and data
recovery, without considering the heterogeneity of traffic. In this paper, we
investigate a non-orthogonal GF-RA scenario where two distinct types of traffic
coexist: event-triggered traffic with alarm devices (ADs), and status update
traffic with monitor devices (MDs). The goal is to simultaneously achieve high
detection success rates for ADs and high information timeliness for MDs. First,
we analyze the age-based random access scheme and optimize the access
parameters to minimize the average age of information (AoI) of MDs. Then, we
design an age-based prior information aided autoencoder (A-PIAAE) to jointly
detect active devices, together with learned pilots used in GF-RA to reduce
interference between non-orthogonal pilots. In the decoder, an Age-based
Learned Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (LISTA-AGE) utilizing the
AoI of MDs as the prior information is proposed to enhance active user
detection. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the proposed A-PIAAE
has better convergence performance. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of
the proposed method in reducing the average AoI of MDs and improving the
successful detection rate of ADs.

physics-based lunar terrain generator, which produces realistic topography
informed by publicly available NASA data, with a ray-tracing engine to create a
high-fidelity dataset of radio propagation scenarios. Building on this dataset,
we introduce a triplet-UNet architecture, consisting of two standard UNets and
a diffusion network, to model complex propagation effects. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing deep learning approaches on
our terrain dataset across various metrics.

*Tian-Yu Xiang,Zheng Lei,Xiao-Hu Zhou,Xiao-Liang Xie,Shi-Qi Liu,Mei-Jiang Gui,Hong-Yun Ou,Xin-Zheng Huang,Xin-Yi Fu,Zeng-Guang Hou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于任务导向学习的自动EEG去噪框架，无需干净参考信号，仅需任务标签即可实现去噪，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EEG去噪方法通常依赖人工干预或干净参考信号，限制了其自动化应用。本文旨在开发一种仅需任务标签即可实现自动去噪的框架。

Method: 通过盲源分离（BSS）技术分解EEG信号，学习基选择器为每个成分分配保留概率，基于概率加权重构信号，并通过下游代理任务模型优化选择器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在任务性能（准确率提升2.56%）和信号质量（信噪比提升0.82dB）上均有显著提升，且具有算法无关性。

Conclusion: 提出的任务导向学习框架是一种实用的EEG去噪解决方案，对神经科学研究和EEG交互系统具有潜在影响。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) denoising methods typically depend on manual
intervention or clean reference signals. This work introduces a task-oriented
learning framework for automatic EEG denoising that uses only task labels
without clean reference signals. EEG recordings are first decomposed into
components based on blind source separation (BSS) techniques. Then, a
learning-based selector assigns a retention probability to each component, and
the denoised signal is reconstructed as a probability-weighted combination. A
downstream proxy-task model evaluates the reconstructed signal, with its task
loss supervising the selector in a collaborative optimization scheme that
relies solely on task labels, eliminating the need for clean EEG references.
Experiments on three datasets spanning two paradigms and multiple noise
conditions show consistent gains in both task performance (accuracy:
$2.56\%\uparrow$) and standard signal-quality metrics (signal-to-noise-ratio:
$0.82$\,dB\,$\uparrow$). Further analyses demonstrate that the task-oriented
learning framework is algorithm-agnostic, as it accommodates diverse
decomposition techniques and network backbones for both the selector and the
proxy model. These promising results indicate that the proposed task-oriented
learning framework is a practical EEG denoising solution with potential
implications for neuroscience research and EEG-based interaction systems.

### [11] [Mitigating the Impact of Location Uncertainty on Radio Map-Based Predictive Rate Selection via Noisy-Input Gaussian Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14710)
*Koya Sato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯过程的预测速率选择框架，能够有效应对定位不确定性，提高6G网络的通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于无线信号地图的速率选择方法通常假设定位信息完美，但实际中定位误差会降低系统可靠性，因此需要一种更稳健的方法。

Method: 引入了噪声输入高斯过程（NIGP），通过泰勒近似将定位噪声视为额外的输出噪声，从而构建更稳健的无线信号地图。

Result: 数值结果表明，NIGP设计比纯高斯过程方法更可靠，且比基于路径损耗的方法具有更高的吞吐量。

Conclusion: NIGP框架能有效提升6G网络中速率选择的可靠性，为未来无线通信系统提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a predictive rate-selection framework based on Gaussian
process (GP)-based radio map construction that is robust to location
uncertainty. Radio maps are a promising tool for improving communication
efficiency in 6G networks. Although they enable the design of location-based
maximum transmission rates by exploiting statistical channel information,
existing discussions often assume perfect (i.e., noiseless) location
information during channel sensing. Since such information must be obtained
from positioning systems such as global navigation satellite systems, it
inevitably involves positioning errors; this location uncertainty can degrade
the reliability of radio map-based wireless systems. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce the noisy-input GP (NIGP), which treats location noise as additional
output noise by applying a Taylor approximation of the function of interest.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NIGP-based design achieves more
reliable transmission-rate selection than pure GP and yields higher throughput
than path loss-based rate selection.

*Ziwei Huang,Shiliang Lu,Lu Bai,Xuesong Cai,Xiang Cheng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器联觉（SoM）的多路径生成大型语言模型（LLM4MG），首次将LLM应用于多路径生成场景，并在6G车联网（V2I）中展示了其性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多路径生成任务中表现不足，尤其是在6G车联网场景下，需要高效的多模态数据处理和知识迁移能力。

Method: 利用LLaMA 3.2模型，通过特征提取与融合网络对齐多模态特征空间，并结合LoRA微调和传播感知提示工程实现知识迁移。

Result: 实验表明，LLM4MG在LoS/NLoS分类、多路径功率/延迟生成精度及跨场景泛化性能上均优于传统深度学习方法。

Conclusion: LLM4MG在多路径生成任务中表现出色，验证了其在车联网系统设计中的实用性和必要性。

Abstract: Based on Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), a large language model (LLM) is
adapted for multipath generation (LLM4MG) for the first time. Considering a
typical sixth-generation (6G) vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario, a new
multi-modal sensing-communication dataset is constructed, named SynthSoM-V2I,
including channel multipath information, millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensory
data, RGB-D images, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. Based
on the SynthSoM-V2I dataset, the proposed LLM4MG leverages Large Language Model
Meta AI (LLaMA) 3.2 for multipath generation via multi-modal sensory data. The
proposed LLM4MG aligns the multi-modal feature space with the LLaMA semantic
space through feature extraction and fusion networks. To further achieve
general knowledge transfer from the pre-trained LLaMA for multipath generation
via multi-modal sensory data, the low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
parameter-efficient fine-tuning and propagation-aware prompt engineering are
exploited. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LLM4MG outperforms
conventional deep learning-based methods in terms of line-of-sight
(LoS)/non-LoS (NLoS) classification with accuracy of 92.76%, multipath
power/delay generation precision with normalized mean square error (NMSE) of
0.099/0.032, and cross-vehicular traffic density (VTD), cross-band, and
cross-scenario generalization. The utility of the proposed LLM4MG is validated
by real-world generalization. The necessity of high-precision multipath
generation for system design is also demonstrated by channel capacity
comparison.

Conclusion: 提出的算法为无监督AAD提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Decoding the attended speaker in a multi-speaker environment from
electroencephalography (EEG) has attracted growing interest in recent years,
with neuro-steered hearing devices as a driver application. Current approaches
typically rely on ground-truth labels of the attended speaker during training,
necessitating calibration sessions for each user and each EEG set-up to achieve
optimal performance. While unsupervised self-adaptive auditory attention
decoding (AAD) for stimulus reconstruction has been developed to eliminate the
need for labeled data, it suffers from an initialization bias that can
compromise performance. Although an unbiased variant has been proposed to
address this limitation, it introduces substantial computational complexity
that scales with data size. This paper presents three computationally efficient
alternatives that achieve comparable performance, but with a significantly
lower and constant computational cost. The code for the proposed algorithms is
available at https://github.com/YYao-42/Unsupervised_AAD.

TL;DR: 本文分析了三种H-NOMA（混合非正交多址）方案在随机信道增益条件下的性能，并推导了其低于传统OMA的闭式概率表达式，同时验证了不同SNR场景下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有H-NOMA分析通常假设固定信道增益顺序，而忽略了信道系数的随机性和时变性。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 分析了三种H-NOMA方案（FSIC、HSIC-NPA、HSIC-PA）在随机信道增益下的性能，并推导了闭式表达式和高SNR渐近结果。

Result: 仿真结果验证了理论分析，并展示了不同SNR下的性能表现，为H-NOMA的部署提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: H-NOMA在随机信道增益下的性能优于传统OMA，为未来无线网络的部署提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA), which combines the advantages
of pure NOMA and conventional OMA organically, has emerged as a highly
promising multiple access technology for future wireless networks. Recent
studies have proposed various H-NOMA systems by employing different successive
interference cancellation (SIC) methods for the NOMA transmission phase.
However, existing analyses typically assume a fixed channel gain order between
paired users, despite the fact that channel coefficients follow random
distribution, leading to their magnitude relationships inherently stochastic
and time varying. This paper analyzes the performance of three H-NOMA schemes
under stochastic channel gain ordering: a) fixed order SIC (FSIC) aided H-NOMA
scheme; b) hybrid SIC with non-power adaptation (HSIC-NPA) aided H-NOMA scheme;
c) hybrid SIC with power adaptation (HSIC-PA) aided H-NOMA scheme. Theoretical
analysis derives closed-form expressions for the probability that H-NOMA
schemes underperform conventional OMA. Asymptotic results in the high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are also developed. Simulation results
validate our analysis and demonstrate the performance of H-NOMA schemes across
different SNR scenarios, providing a theoretical foundation for the deployment

### [15] [Sampling Method for Generalized Graph Signals with Pre-selected Vertices via DC Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14836)
*Keitaro Yamashita,Kazuki Naganuma,Shunsuke Ono*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于广义采样理论的图信号顶点灵活采样方法，通过优化问题设计采样算子，解决现有方法无法处理必须或禁止采样顶点的问题，并通过DC优化算法实现高效求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法结合顶点必须或禁止采样的先验知识，限制了采样灵活性和恢复精度。

Method: 将采样算子设计问题转化为DC优化问题，利用核范数和DC惩罚处理顶点选择约束，并开发双近端梯度DC求解器。

Result: 在多种图信号模型和真实数据上的实验表明，该方法在恢复精度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了顶点灵活采样和信号恢复的精度，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for vertex-wise flexible sampling of a broad
class of graph signals, designed to attain the best possible recovery based on
the generalized sampling theory. This is achieved by designing a sampling
operator by an optimization problem, which is inherently non-convex, as the
best possible recovery imposes a rank constraint. An existing method for
vertex-wise flexible sampling is able to control the number of active vertices
but cannot incorporate prior knowledge of mandatory or forbidden vertices. To
address these challenges, we formulate the operator design as a problem that
handles a constraint of the number of active vertices and prior knowledge on
specific vertices for sampling, mandatory inclusion or exclusion. We
transformed this constrained problem into a difference-of-convex (DC)
optimization problem by using the nuclear norm and a DC penalty for vertex
selection. To solve this, we develop a convergent solver based on the general
double-proximal gradient DC algorithm. The effectiveness of our method is
demonstrated through experiments on various graph signal models, including
real-world data, showing superior performance in the recovery accuracy by
comparing to existing methods.

*Flor Ortiz,Eva Lagunas*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合预计算路由表和深度Q学习（DQL）备用机制的混合策略，用于下一代卫星轨道（NGSO）星座中的动态路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全基于强化学习（RL）的方案在拓扑动态变化时适应性好但复杂度高、收敛时间长且在重负载下性能不稳定，因此需要一种更高效且稳定的路由方案。

Method: 在正常条件下使用预计算的路由表，仅在链路不可用或拥塞时选择性激活DQL代理。

Result: 仿真结果表明，混合策略在大规模NGSO网络中相比纯RL基线具有更高的包交付率、更低的端到端延迟、更短的平均跳数和更高的吞吐量。

Conclusion: 混合路由是一种可扩展且具备弹性的解决方案，适用于对延迟敏感的卫星宽带服务。

Abstract: This letter investigates dynamic routing in Next-Generation Satellite Orbit
(NGSO) constellations and proposes a hybrid strategy that combines precomputed
routing tables with a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) fallback mechanism. While fully
RL-based schemes offer adaptability to topology dynamics, they often suffer
from high complexity, long convergence times, and unstable performance under
heavy traffic. In contrast, the proposed framework exploits deterministic table
lookups under nominal conditions and selectively activates the DQL agent only
when links become unavailable or congested. Simulation results in large-scale
NGSO networks show that the hybrid approach consistently achieves higher packet
delivery ratio, lower end-to-end delay, shorter average hop count, and improved
throughput compared to a pure RL baseline. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of hybrid routing as a scalable and resilient solution for
delay-sensitive satellite broadband services

*Deijany Rodriguez Linares,Oksana Moryakova,Håkan Johansson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于级联累加器的高效计算时间索引加权和方法，显著降低了计算和存储开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统直接计算方法在大规模数据时计算成本过高，而现有替代方案需要存储整个数据块，无法满足实时处理需求。

Method: 利用累加器的特性，消除了存储需求，并将乘法次数减少到仅需K+1次常数乘法。

Result: 该方法在样本逐处理系统中实现了高效计算，适用于实时实现。

Conclusion: 通过级联累加器实现了高效且轻量级的时间索引加权和计算。

Abstract: This letter presents a novel approach for \mbox{efficiently} computing
time-index powered weighted sums of the form $\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} n^{K} v[n]$
using cascaded accumulators. Traditional direct computation requires
$K{\times}N$ general multiplications, which become prohibitive for large $N$,
while alternative strategies based on lookup tables or signal reversal require
storing entire data blocks. By exploiting accumulator properties, the proposed
method eliminates the need for such storage and reduces the multiplicative cost
to only $K{+}1$ constant multiplications, enabling efficient real-time
implementation. The approach is particularly useful when such sums need to be
efficiently computed in sample-by-sample processing systems.

*Navid Hasanzadeh,Shahrokh Valaee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多天线AP的框架，利用DoRF拟合误差来抑制噪声和选择最具信息量的天线，显著提升了Wi-Fi基于人类活动识别的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi CSI信号受到异步AP时钟和环境及硬件噪声的影响，限制了HAR性能，因此需要一种新方法来抑制噪声并提升识别能力。

Method: 通过DoRF拟合误差来抑制噪声并选择最具信息量的天线，构建了一个基于多天线AP的新框架。

Result: 在小规模手势识别数据集上，该方法的泛化能力显著提升，证明了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的DoRF引导的Wi-Fi HAR方法有效解决了噪声问题，为实际部署提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: With the IEEE 802.11bf Task Group introducing amendments to the WLAN standard
for advanced sensing, interest in using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
for remote sensing has surged. Recent findings indicate that learning a unified
three-dimensional motion representation through Doppler Radiance Fields (DoRFs)
derived from CSI significantly improves the generalization capabilities of
Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR). Despite this progress, CSI
signals remain affected by asynchronous access point (AP) clocks and additive
noise from environmental and hardware sources. Consequently, even with existing
preprocessing techniques, both the CSI data and Doppler velocity projections
used in DoRFs are still susceptible to noise and outliers, limiting HAR
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for
multi-antenna APs to suppress noise and identify the most informative antennas
based on DoRF fitting errors, which capture inconsistencies among Doppler
velocity projections. Experimental results on a challenging small-scale hand
gesture recognition dataset demonstrate that the proposed DoRF-guided
Wi-Fi-based HAR approach significantly improves generalization capability,
paving the way for robust real-world sensing deployments.

*Jingreng Lei,Yang Li,Ziyue Wang,Qingfeng Lin,Ya-Feng Liu,Yik-Chung Wu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于协方差的混合近远场信道建模，揭示了近场信道比例增加对检测性能的增强作用，并提出了一种分布式算法以降低计算复杂度和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着接入点天线数量的增加，传统远场传播假设不再适用，需解决混合近远场信道的活动检测问题。

Method: 建立基于协方差的信道模型，提出分布式算法，各接入点进行本地检测并交换结果。

Result: 理论分析表明近场信道比例增加可提升检测性能，仿真验证了算法的优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的算法不仅收敛有保障，性能优于现有方法，且适用于单小区或无小区系统的近远场设备。

Abstract: A great amount of endeavor has recently been devoted to activity detection
for massive machine-type communications in cell-free multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, as the number of antennas at the
access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the
near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional
assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this
challenge, this paper establishes a covariance-based formulation that can
effectively capture the statistical property of hybrid near-far field channels.
Based on this formulation, we theoretically reveal that increasing the
proportion of near-field channels enhances the detection performance.
Furthermore, we propose a distributed algorithm, where each AP performs local
activity detection and only exchanges the detection results to the central
processing unit, thus significantly reducing the computational complexity and
the communication overhead. Not only with convergence guarantee, the proposed
algorithm is unified in the sense that it can handle single-cell or cell-free
systems with either near-field or far-field devices as special cases.
Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses and demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为AEGIS的自动化错误生成与识别框架，用于解决多智能体系统（MAS）缺乏大规模、多样化错误数据集的问题，并展示了其在不同学习范式中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统的自主性和复杂性增加，理解其错误模式对确保可靠性至关重要。现有研究因缺乏大规模、多样化且标注精确的错误数据集而受限。

Method: AEGIS通过系统性地向成功轨迹中注入可控且可追踪的错误，创建丰富的真实失败数据集。使用基于LLM的上下文感知操纵器进行高级攻击（如提示注入和响应损坏）以诱导特定错误模式。

Result: 实验表明，使用AEGIS数据训练的模型在监督微调、强化学习和对比学习三种学习范式中均表现显著提升，部分模型性能甚至优于更大的专有系统。

Conclusion: AEGIS为开发更鲁棒和可解释的多智能体系统提供了关键资源，其自动化数据生成框架的有效性得到验证。

Abstract: As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex,
understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and
safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack
of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and
\textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically
injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful
trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved
using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs
sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce
specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by
exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task:
Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our
comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve
substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several
of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior
to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated
data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and
interpretable multi-agent systems. Our project website is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlowDrive是一种新颖的自动驾驶框架，通过引入基于物理的流场（如风险势能和车道吸引力场）来增强BEV空间的语义先验和安全提示，提升轨迹规划的适应性和可解释性，并在实验中表现出卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶框架在运动规划中缺乏对风险和语义先验的显式建模，FlowDrive旨在填补这一空白，提供更安全和可解释的规划。

Method: FlowDrive通过能量流场编码语义和安全信息，利用条件扩散规划器分离运动意图预测和轨迹去噪，增强多模态多样性。

Result: 在NAVSIM v2基准测试中，FlowDrive以86.3的EPDMS得分超越现有基线，表现出更高的安全性和规划质量。

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过显式流场和条件扩散规划器，显著提升了自动驾驶规划的安全性和适应性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images
to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning,
autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by
geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft,
rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic
priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features
learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance
priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose
FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable
energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to
encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware
features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as
interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples
motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion
planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing
multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that
FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3,
surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality. The project is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多机器人在无机械耦合或通信的情况下如何通过接触力协同运输物体，解决传统方法依赖刚性连接的局限性。

Method: 采用分层策略架构（分离基础移动和手臂控制）和星座奖励公式，通过奖励设计和训练课程鼓励机器人表现如刚性连接。

Result: 在2-10个机器人团队中实现了对不同几何和质量物体的稳健运输，并展示了轻量物体的仿真到现实迁移效果。

Conclusion: 通过隐式同步和共享策略参数，该方法实现了无通信的多机器人协同运输，且无需针对不同团队规模重新训练。

Abstract: We study decentralized cooperative transport using teams of N-quadruped
robots with arm that must pinch, lift, and move ungraspable objects through
physical contact alone. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid mechanical
coupling between robots and objects, we address the more challenging setting
where mechanically independent robots must coordinate through contact forces
alone without any communication or centralized control. To this end, we employ
a hierarchical policy architecture that separates base locomotion from arm
control, and propose a constellation reward formulation that unifies position
and orientation tracking to enforce rigid contact behavior. The key insight is
encouraging robots to behave as if rigidly connected to the object through
careful reward design and training curriculum rather than explicit mechanical
constraints. Our approach enables coordination through shared policy parameters
and implicit synchronization cues - scaling to arbitrary team sizes without
retraining. We show extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate robust
transport across 2-10 robots on diverse object geometries and masses, along
with sim2real transfer results on lightweight objects.

Abstract: We introduce LeVR, a modular software framework designed to bridge two
critical gaps in robotic imitation learning. First, it provides robust and
intuitive virtual reality (VR) teleoperation for data collection using robot
arms paired with dexterous hands, addressing a common limitation in existing
systems. Second, it natively integrates with the powerful LeRobot imitation

streamlining the demonstration collection process. To demonstrate LeVR, we
release LeFranX, an open-source implementation for the Franka FER arm and
RobotEra XHand, two widely used research platforms. LeFranX delivers a
seamless, end-to-end workflow from data collection to real-world policy
deployment. We validate our system by collecting a public dataset of 100 expert

policies. We provide our open-source framework, implementation, and dataset to
accelerate IL research for the robotics community.

Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous
whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion
models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a
diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL
policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a
drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed
prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that
diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in
sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1
robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower

Result: CRAFT在多四足导航和双手操作任务中成功学习了复杂协调行为，并在真实硬件实验中验证了导航策略。

Conclusion: CRAFT展示了利用基础模型解决多机器人协调任务的潜力，为MARL在机器人领域的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for
learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to
robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint
action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent
to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination
through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built
upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching
Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot
coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of
foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT
automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of
subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what
follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and
refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement
loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation
tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In
addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware
experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RBind是一个两阶段对抗不变跨模态对齐框架，用于增强多模态编码器的鲁棒性，通过无监督微调和跨模态对齐提升对抗性和自然干扰下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一的模态编码器在机器人感知和决策中具有吸引力，但在实际部署中面临对抗性和自然干扰，需要提高鲁棒性以确保安全性。

Method: RBind采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过无监督微调强化视觉编码器；第二阶段利用跨模态对应关系，最小化干净/对抗特征与文本锚点的差异，并实现跨模态的类别分布对齐。

Result: RBind在图像、音频、热感和视频数据上表现优异，在干净准确性和对抗鲁棒性方面均优于LanguageBind基准和标准微调基线。

Conclusion: RBind在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下提高了鲁棒性，为机器人多传感器感知提供了安全且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into
a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception
and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to
adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for
safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within
CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding
modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a
two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust
unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on
clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages
cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between
clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise
distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,
Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the
LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy
and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without
sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer
multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,
and other autonomy settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升异构机器人团队的高效协作能力，摆脱传统固定手势命令的限制，实现动态任务分配。

Method: 利用视觉感知将手势转为文本描述，通过大型语言模型推断意图并生成机器人特定指令，实时匹配最适合的机器人执行任务。

Result: 系统支持上下文感知的自适应控制，无需用户明确指定目标或命令，实现高效灵活的机器人协作。

Conclusion: GestOS通过智能任务编排，推动了手势交互的发展，适用于动态环境中的机器人协作。

Abstract: We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of
heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed
commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically
and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their
capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system
combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM)
reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which
the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot
selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the
most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware,
adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or
commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent
orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly
collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于感知的安全过滤器，将3D高斯泼溅体转化为封闭形式的碰撞锥，生成控制障碍函数，实现高效、平滑的避障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统距离CBF因反应迟滞导致避障动作不够平滑且计算成本高的问题。

Method: 通过分析泼溅体的几何形状，构建封闭式碰撞锥和CBF，嵌入二次规划中。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在大型场景中减少规划时间3倍，显著降低轨迹抖动，同时保持安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需高阶CBF扩展，适用于复杂环境中的实时导航。

Abstract: We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian
Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a
first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program
(QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a
continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both
simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to
activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone
CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby
produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We
validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats,
where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly
decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while
maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic,
requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to
robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the
splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time
navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including
space robotics and satellite systems.

Motivation: 多智能体强化学习在复杂决策中具有潜力，但在竞争性任务中存在训练不稳定、泛化能力差等挑战。

Method: LEGO框架结合图神经网络、规范化和异构表示，提升MARL的稳定性和泛化性。

Result: 实验表明LEGO在协作和竞争任务中优于基线方法，且对智能体数量变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LEGO通过结合新颖的技术，为MARL的稳定性和泛化性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major
challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks,
simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures
often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration
rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address
these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural
Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL
algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture
permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers,
canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous
representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on
cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong
baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO
demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.

Conclusion: 结论是心理理论可以指导强化学习实现欺骗性行为，无需手工策略，且在实时硬件中表现优异。

Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored
continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within
known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a
private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's
reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,
human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the
representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that
Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL)
toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and
distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of
deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike
the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief
that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a
KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar
informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and
compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In
real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV)
navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success
with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.

### [31] [Learning Discrete Abstractions for Visual Rearrangement Tasks Using Vision-Guided Graph Coloring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14460)
*Abhiroop Ajith,Constantinos Chamzas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种直接从视觉数据中学习抽象结构的方法，用于机器人重排任务，通过结合结构约束和注意力引导的视觉距离，提升了规划的效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够高效地在复杂环境中解决问题，得益于高层次抽象推理能力。然而机器人领域的抽象层次通常需要人工设计，限制了其可扩展性和适用性。直接从视觉数据中自动化发现有用的抽象是提升机器人规划框架的关键。

Method: 提出了一种方法，通过结合结构约束和注意力引导的视觉距离，从视觉数据中诱导离散的图结构抽象。该方法利用了重排任务固有的二分结构，将结构约束和视觉嵌入整合到一个统一框架中。

Result: 在模拟环境中对两种重排任务进行测试，结果表明该方法能够一致地识别出有意义的抽象结构，有效支持高层规划，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地从视觉数据中自动发现了有用的抽象结构，验证了其在机器人重排任务中的有效性，为提升规划框架的可扩展性和适用性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics.
Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level
subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability
that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics,
abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet
they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and
limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly
from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more
applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on
rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose
a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining
structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach
leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems,
integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified
framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision
alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our
method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently
identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and
outperform existing approaches.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了软体机器人手和触觉传感技术的结合，利用机器学习提升GelSight Baby Fin Ray在纹理分类、力和位置估计等方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在进一步挖掘GelSight Baby Fin Ray的潜力，探索其在触觉图像中提取信息的能力。

Method: 采用摄像机触觉传感技术，结合多种神经网络结构（如ResNet50、GoogLeNet和CNN）进行纹理和力/位置估计的研究。

Result: 通过实验验证，机器学习能有效从触觉图像中提取有用信息，提升软体机器人与环境的交互能力。

Conclusion: 机器学习为软体机器人提供了强大的工具，帮助其更好地理解和适应环境。

Abstract: Recent advances in soft robotic hands and tactile sensing have enabled both
to perform an increasing number of complex tasks with the aid of machine
learning. In particular, we presented the GelSight Baby Fin Ray in our previous
work, which integrates a camera with a soft, compliant Fin Ray structure.
Camera-based tactile sensing gives the GelSight Baby Fin Ray the ability to
capture rich contact information like forces, object geometries, and textures.
Moreover, our previous work showed that the GelSight Baby Fin Ray can dig
through clutter, and classify in-shell nuts. To further examine the potential
of the GelSight Baby Fin Ray, we leverage learning to distinguish nut-in-shell
textures and to perform force and position estimation. We implement ablation
studies with popular neural network structures, including ResNet50, GoogLeNet,
and 3- and 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. We conclude
that machine learning is a promising technique to extract useful information
from high-resolution tactile images and empower soft robotics to better
understand and interact with the environments.

TL;DR: Event-LAB是一个统一框架，解决了事件定位研究中代码和数据格式多样化的问题，通过Pixi包管理实现便捷安装，并支持多种定位方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件定位研究快速发展，但代码和数据集格式多样化导致比较和实现困难。

Method: 提出Event-LAB框架，使用Pixi包管理器实现单命令安装和调用，支持多种定位方法（如VPR和SLAM）。

Result: 框架能系统分析结果，揭示事件收集参数对性能的影响。

Conclusion: Event-LAB为研究社区提供了统一的比较平台，强调在一致的参数下公平比较方法的重要性。

Abstract: Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of
interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published
papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the
field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the
variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats,
making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement
reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified
framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across
multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and
dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and
invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common
event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the
framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple
methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of
parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame
generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis
demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent
event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this
ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for
easily setting up multiple conditions.

TL;DR: 该论文针对草莓采摘中由于水果被遮挡导致机器人难以精准采摘的问题，提出了一种基于人类示范学习的草莓采摘机器人系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草莓通常生长在密集的簇中，易被叶片和茎秆遮挡，传统机器人系统难以在遮挡情况下精准采摘，因此需要一种新的解决方案。

Method: 采用4自由度SCARA机械臂和人类遥控接口收集数据，并结合改进的End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer（ACT）模型，开发精细的视觉运动采摘策略。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的方法在多种遮挡场景下显著优于直接应用ACT模型，展示了其在实际采摘中的潜力。

Conclusion: 基于人类示范学习的采摘系统能有效解决遮挡环境下的草莓采摘问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and
other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit
presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional
percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter.
Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to
carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely
access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To
address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that
learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired
with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and
leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a
fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion
scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the
direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical
application in occluded strawberry picking.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了振动筛分机操作的自动化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker
operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1)
dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in
overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with
orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including
inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to
prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework
combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization.
The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency
in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying,
imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to
80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes
the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment,
validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.

Abstract: Curated datasets are essential for training and evaluating AI approaches, but
are often lacking in domains where language and physical action are deeply
intertwined. In particular, few datasets capture how people acquire embodied
skills through verbal instruction over time. To address this gap, we introduce
SimCoachCorpus: a unique dataset of race car simulator driving that allows for
the investigation of rich interactive phenomena during guided and unguided
motor skill acquisition. In this dataset, 29 humans were asked to drive in a
simulator around a race track for approximately ninety minutes. Fifteen
participants were given personalized one-on-one instruction from a professional
performance driving coach, and 14 participants drove without coaching. \name\
includes embodied features such as vehicle state and inputs, map (track
boundaries and raceline), and cone landmarks. These are synchronized with
concurrent verbal coaching from a professional coach and additional feedback at
the end of each lap. We further provide annotations of coaching categories for
each concurrent feedback utterance, ratings on students' compliance with
coaching advice, and self-reported cognitive load and emotional state of
participants (gathered from surveys during the study). The dataset includes
over 20,000 concurrent feedback utterances, over 400 terminal feedback
utterances, and over 40 hours of vehicle driving data. Our naturalistic dataset
can be used for investigating motor learning dynamics, exploring linguistic
phenomena, and training computational models of teaching. We demonstrate
applications of this dataset for in-context learning, imitation learning, and
topic modeling. The dataset introduced in this work will be released publicly
upon publication of the peer-reviewed version of this paper. Researchers

Conclusion: 该方法在可重构机器人拆卸中具有高效性和适应性。

Abstract: This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules,
sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically
disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems
must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but
the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address
this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools,
together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system
is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting
multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic
timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for
sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint
programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search
space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained
structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable
robotic disassembly.

Conclusion: 通过强调动作空间设计，该方法显著提升了跨具身预训练的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks,
environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their
ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most
approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less
attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration
generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this
challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies
equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this
principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment
equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an
action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates
a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial
reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables
efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有的BEV表示方法在单目视觉里程计中存在稀疏监督信号和信息丢失的问题，限制了其性能。

Method: BEV-ODOM2引入了密集BEV光流监督和PV-BEV融合技术，在不增加额外标注的情况下提升了性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上（包括新收集的ZJH-VO数据集）实现了state-of-the-art性能，RTE提升了40%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著改善了BEV表示的性能，并为未来研究提供了公开的ZJH-VO数据集。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation offers a metric-scaled planar workspace,
facilitating the simplification of 6-DoF ego-motion to a more robust 3-DoF
model for monocular visual odometry (MVO) in intelligent transportation
systems. However, existing BEV methods suffer from sparse supervision signals
and information loss during perspective-to-BEV projection. We present
BEV-ODOM2, an enhanced framework addressing both limitations without additional
annotations. Our approach introduces: (1) dense BEV optical flow supervision
constructed from 3-DoF pose ground truth for pixel-level guidance; (2) PV-BEV
fusion that computes correlation volumes before projection to preserve 6-DoF
motion cues while maintaining scale consistency. The framework employs three
supervision levels derived solely from pose data: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF for the
PV branch, and final 3-DoF output. Enhanced rotation sampling further balances
diverse motion patterns in training. Extensive evaluation on KITTI, NCLT,
Oxford, and our newly collected ZJH-VO multi-scale dataset demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 40 improvement in RTE compared to
previous BEV methods. The ZJH-VO dataset, covering diverse ground vehicle
scenarios from underground parking to outdoor plazas, is publicly available to
facilitate future research.

Motivation: 现有的三平面方法依赖2D图像特征和插值，计算量大，不适合嵌入式3D推理。

Method: 采用无插值的三平面提升和体素融合，通过广播和求和重建特征体积，并引入低分辨率体素分支捕获全局上下文。

Result: 分类和完成任务保持或提高准确率，分割和检测任务在略微牺牲准确率的情况下显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适合嵌入式机器人感知，能在NVIDIA Jetson Orin nano上实现实时处理。

Abstract: Dense 3D convolutions provide high accuracy for perception but are too
computationally expensive for real-time robotic systems. Existing tri-plane
methods rely on 2D image features with interpolation, point-wise queries, and
implicit MLPs, which makes them computationally heavy and unsuitable for
embedded 3D inference. As an alternative, we propose a novel interpolation-free
tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion framework, that directly projects 3D
voxels into plane features and reconstructs a feature volume through broadcast
and summation. This shifts nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, reducing complexity
while remaining fully parallelizable. To capture global context, we add a
low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a
lightweight integration layer, yielding a design that is both efficient and
end-to-end GPU-accelerated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we conduct experiments on classification, completion, segmentation, and
detection, and we map the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy across
tasks. Results show that classification and completion retain or improve
accuracy, while segmentation and detection trade modest drops in accuracy for
significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on an NVIDIA Jetson
Orin nano confirm robust real-time throughput, demonstrating the suitability of
the approach for embedded robotic perception.

Abstract: The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces
several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition,
the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between

RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror
builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference
system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To
facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated
VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive
trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative
models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and
robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where
models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot
seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of
these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that
significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

outperforms traditional tactile imitation learning. Our work bridges the gap

Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK
2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by
Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez
et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom
(DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the
differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a
smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space
singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which
makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a
singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation
of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

Abstract: While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in
autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance
on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as
trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,
whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but
still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning
(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate
objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of
directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this
work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by
incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,
directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The
sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the
discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish
a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare
three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and
parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the
proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three
objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.

### [45] [Investigating the Effect of LED Signals and Emotional Displays in Human-Robot Shared Workspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14748)
*Maria Ibrahim,Alap Kshirsagar,Dorothea Koert,Jan Peters*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究了非语言交流对人与机器人协作的影响，发现情感展示虽增强互动性，但对任务表现改善有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在共享工作空间中，非语言交流（如灯光信号和情感展示）如何提高人机协作的安全性和效率。

Method: 在机器人上集成LED灯带和表情显示装置，通过18名参与者的协作实验评估灯光信号和情感展示的效果。

Result: 情感展示虽增加了互动感，但并未显著提升碰撞预期、交流清晰度或任务效率。

Conclusion: 情感提示可增强用户参与感，但对共享工作空间中的任务表现影响有限。

Abstract: Effective communication is essential for safety and efficiency in human-robot
collaboration, particularly in shared workspaces. This paper investigates the
impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by
integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic
system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end
effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent
through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot
collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED
signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals
with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires
and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived
clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while
emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did
not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or
task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that
while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task
performance in shared workspaces is limited.

Conclusion: PVRs在视觉安全过滤器设计中具有潜力，但其效果因任务而异。在实际部署中，需权衡训练策略和资源限制。

Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge
hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained
increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical
control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have
so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be
effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this
paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for
designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers
defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety
filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between
training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the
models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is
superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions
are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical
considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受限和杂乱环境中的操作因部分可观测性和复杂的配置空间而具有挑战性，需要智能探索策略来安全理解场景并搜索目标。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包括碰撞感知的采样规划器、局部碰撞地图构建、多目标效用函数选择视点，以及受限操作优化策略。

Result: 模拟实验中操作成功率提高24.25%，真实实验验证了其在受限环境中主动感知和操作的能力。

Conclusion: COMPASS框架有效解决了受限环境中的操作问题，为同类问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces.
Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration
strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper,
we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework
featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce
collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision
map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find
viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation.
Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to
generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To
systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we
propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing
four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for
other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases
manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments
demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in
confined environments.

Motivation: 传统强化学习在多目标任务中由于奖励标量化导致梯度冲突，限制了可扩展性和性能。

Method: 使用多头评论家和优先级分解的梯度更新，提出GCR-PPO方法。

Result: 在IsaacLab基准测试中，GCR-PPO比并行PPO平均提升9.5%，高冲突任务效果更佳。

Conclusion: GCR-PPO在多目标任务中表现出更高的性能和可扩展性，解决了梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task
objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy
optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot
locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning
and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the
number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their
trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain
underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation
difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient
contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task
objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between
task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic
behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that
decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed
critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology,
GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion
benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks.
We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without
significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more
conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average
improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

Conclusion: CollabVLA是将VLA从黑盒控制器转变为可与人类协作的智能助手的重要突破。

Abstract: In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action
framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative
assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain
overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary
generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with
diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a
two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it
supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when
confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x
and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates,
improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing
methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque
controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and
collaborating with humans.

TL;DR: PERAL是一种感知感知运动控制框架，通过被动激发LiDAR提升垂直扫描多样性，显著提高地图完整性和轨迹跟踪精度，同时降低成本与功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR-IMU里程计在水平安装LiDAR时捕获近地面数据少，影响地形感知与性能，现有解决方案需牺牲水平感知或增加硬件成本。

Method: PERAL通过建模内部差速驱动与传感器姿态的耦合，在目标跟踪命令中叠加有界非周期性振荡，无需专用硬件即可丰富垂直扫描多样性。

Result: 实验显示PERAL在多种环境中实现96%地图完整性、轨迹跟踪误差降低27%，并有效检测近地面物体，且成本与功耗更低。

Conclusion: PERAL作为一种低成本、高效能的解决方案，显著提升了LiDAR-IMU里程计的性能，适用于紧凑型球形机器人。

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for
navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360
capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading
performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt,
active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal
perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a
perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves
passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling
between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL
superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or
trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while
preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL
is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments.
Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent
reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection,
all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active
rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be
open-sourced upon acceptance.

Motivation: 传统机器人软件框架在处理大规模数据和模型中心化的机器人学习任务时成为瓶颈，仿真系统对真实实验的过渡支持有限。

Method: RCS 是一个模块化、可扩展的分层架构，支持仿真与实物机器人的统一接口，促进仿真到真实的转换。

Result: RCS 展示了对 VLA 和 RL 策略开发周期的实用性，并通过实验验证了仿真数据对提升真实世界策略性能的作用。

Conclusion: RCS 提供了一个高效、功能完备的工具，推动了大规模通用策略在机器人学习中的应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning.
They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert
policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In
this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and
scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a
bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for
transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this
gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from
the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist
policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered
architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots,
facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and
dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world
experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is
twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design
principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the
development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an
extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed
light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance. Our

Abstract: This paper presents a CAD-driven co-design framework for optimizing
jet-powered aerial humanoid robots to execute dynamically constrained
trajectories. Starting from the iRonCub-Mk3 model, a Design of Experiments
(DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically
feasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g.,
angle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed
through CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with
simulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity
analysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids
selected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight
performance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based
linearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective
optimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring
the space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to
minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The
framework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated
control parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing
feasible aerial humanoid designs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of
articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain
significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel
framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and
linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency
and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART
leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify
optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these
interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an
optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the
limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline
reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation
ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness. For

Conclusion: Multi-CAP通过连接感知图和全局路径规划，显著提升了多机器人覆盖任务的性能。

Abstract: Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown
environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total
coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we
introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical
coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination
through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and
dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a
set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the
environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement
of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical
layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots
explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal
routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that
minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set
of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting
its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on
real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through
simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time,
total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate
the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner
in achieving these performance gains.

Conclusion: HICS-SLAM框架证明了人机协作在语义SLAM中的有效性，具有进一步扩展潜力。

Abstract: Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems enrich robot
maps with structural and semantic information, enabling robots to operate more
effectively in complex environments. However, these systems struggle in
real-world scenarios with occlusions, incomplete data, or ambiguous geometries,
as they cannot fully leverage the higher-level spatial and semantic knowledge
humans naturally apply. We introduce HICS-SLAM, a Human-in-the-Loop semantic
SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality environment for real-time
collaboration. The system allows human operators to directly interact with and
visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a
graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human
interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for
enhanced situational awareness. Experimental evaluations on real-world
construction site datasets demonstrate improvements in room detection accuracy,
map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines,
demonstrating both the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for
future extensions.

Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture
classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system
utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a
series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture
classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as
the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding.
We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final
accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In
the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these
two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds.
Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\%
with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of
only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the
optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in
texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing
robotic environmental interaction.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration in surgery is affected by the inherent
ambiguity of verbal communication. This paper presents a framework for a
robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal
instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the
operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning
process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal
vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge
base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal
prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence
measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous
commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical
requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation
rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the

Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical
missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving it requires addressing three key
challenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,
quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of
unknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path
Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the
first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can
effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the
full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs
such as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is
limited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by
large obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI
(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory
online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,
PA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown
regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood
of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we
demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and
mapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging
settings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate
that PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation
foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly
reachable.

robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation
in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are
available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/m4diffuser.

Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems,
must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a
wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of
sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for
placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of
the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile
feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand
object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different
parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning
control policies and investigate the relationship between object
characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing
configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of
manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of
anthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主挖掘机部署中的挑战性问题，如未见过的工地条件和硬件配置的鲁棒性处理。

Method: 通过大规模从专家演示中预训练策略，然后用监督微调（SFT）或强化学习微调（RLFT）进行任务或条件适配。

Result: ExT策略在仿真和现实中达到厘米级精度，性能媲美专门单任务控制器，并能快速适应新任务和条件。

Conclusion: ExT为可扩展和通用的自主挖掘提供了潜在基础。

Abstract: Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and
societal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems
must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware
configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered,
task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new
scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have
shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as
manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction
machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified
open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining,
and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first
trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then
fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through
both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT
policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy,
successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance
comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation,
we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new
tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while
maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results
highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and
generalizable autonomous excavation.

Abstract: Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet
remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments.
In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel
Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide
high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic
environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map
representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes
global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift.
Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using
a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal
drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and
dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for
flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing
localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments
conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575
hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The
results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art
LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments,
highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.

Abstract: We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that
incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient
intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot
coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set
of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task
performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network
flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online
algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task
failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline
approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random
missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a
greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced
simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and
executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy
in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task
plans while leveraging task relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于VLA的具身代理多为单向模式，无法处理现实中模糊的指令。本文旨在通过多轮对话和协作方式解决这一问题。

Method: Ask-to-Clarify框架由协作VLM和扩散动作模块组成，通过两阶段知识隔离策略训练，包括处理模糊对话和生成动作。

Result: 该框架在8个真实任务中表现优于现有VLA，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Ask-to-Clarify框架及训练策略为实现协作性具身代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can
interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions.
This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based
on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this
goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way
mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This
approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.
In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our
framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a
multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.
Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM
for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection
module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the
VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable
conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation
strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using
ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the
action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the
interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The
training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then
generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router
that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We
evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it
outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our
proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward
collaborative embodied agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种能量约束的轨迹规划框架，用于行星探测车在混合能源输入下的长时间任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来行星探测车需要在混合能源（RTG和太阳能）下长时间运行，但现有规划方法未充分结合功率流或瞬时功率约束。

Method: 通过将平移、旋转和阻力功率的物理模型与基线子系统负载结合，框架在SE(2)多项式轨迹优化中集成了累积能量预算和瞬时功率约束。

Result: 在月表模拟中，该方法生成的轨迹峰值功率仅超出限制0.55%，而现有方法超出17%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为行星任务提供了一种既符合能量约束又动态可行的轨迹规划方案。

Abstract: Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on
hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator
(RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While
energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under
battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or
enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners
emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods
typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting
energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning
framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,
rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid
RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and
instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory
optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,
dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like
terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within
0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by
over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to
energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理真实世界中的噪声和非平稳时间序列数据时表现不佳，尤其是在强力工具使用任务中。

Method: 基于扩散模型提取力-扭矩特征，并提出并行异常评分评估方法。

Result: 在四个强力工具使用任务中，AnoF-Diff在F1-score和AUROC指标上优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: AnoF-Diff在噪声数据集中表现更鲁棒，且适用于在线异常检测。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying
unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for
several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful
tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world
tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies
across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a
method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque
features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect
anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms
of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)
on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better
performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method
of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and
demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several
forceful tool use experiments.

Conclusion: 优化设计在环境不确定性和制造误差下表现出鲁棒性，成功应用于障碍物丰富的环境中。

Abstract: Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated
remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and
dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the
environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has
focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with
pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots
is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this
end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,
bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to
include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these
models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model
and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our
framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for
vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that
minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.
We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing
uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully
deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.

Result: 在模拟情感语音数据集和截断的AMI数据集上分别实现了49%和35%的错误率降低。

Conclusion: 通过风格可控的语音生成和说话人嵌入混合，显著提升了说话人分区系统在高变异性场景下的性能。

Abstract: Speaker diarization systems often struggle with high intrinsic intra-speaker
variability, such as shifts in emotion, health, or content. This can cause
segments from the same speaker to be misclassified as different individuals,
for example, when one raises their voice or speaks faster during conversation.
To address this, we propose a style-controllable speech generation model that
augments speech across diverse styles while preserving the target speaker's
identity. The proposed system starts with diarized segments from a conventional
diarizer. For each diarized segment, it generates augmented speech samples
enriched with phonetic and stylistic diversity. And then, speaker embeddings
from both the original and generated audio are blended to enhance the system's
robustness in grouping segments with high intrinsic intra-speaker variability.
We validate our approach on a simulated emotional speech dataset and the
truncated AMI dataset, demonstrating significant improvements, with error rate
reductions of 49% and 35% on each dataset, respectively.

Result: 在可见和未见语料上通过客观评估验证了模型有效性，并分析了人类标记一致性对分类准确性的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效识别多种说话风格，为多标签语音分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-label classification framework to detect
multiple speaking styles in a speech sample. Unlike previous studies that have
primarily focused on identifying a single target style, our framework
effectively captures various speaker characteristics within a unified
structure, making it suitable for generalized human-computer interaction
applications. The proposed framework integrates cross-attention mechanisms
within a transformer decoder to extract salient features associated with each
target label from the input speech. To mitigate the data imbalance inherent in
multi-label speech datasets, we employ a data augmentation technique based on a
speech generation model. We validate our model's effectiveness through multiple
objective evaluations on seen and unseen corpora. In addition, we provide an
analysis of the influence of human perception on classification accuracy by
considering the impact of human labeling agreement on model performance.

Abstract: Replay speech attacks pose a significant threat to voice-controlled systems,
especially in smart environments where voice assistants are widely deployed.
While multi-channel audio offers spatial cues that can enhance replay detection
robustness, existing datasets and methods predominantly rely on single-channel
recordings. In this work, we introduce an acoustic simulation framework
designed to simulate multi-channel replay speech configurations using publicly
available resources. Our setup models both genuine and spoofed speech across
varied environments, including realistic microphone and loudspeaker impulse
responses, room acoustics, and noise conditions. The framework employs measured
loudspeaker directionalities during the replay attack to improve the realism of
the simulation. We define two spoofing settings, which simulate whether a
reverberant or an anechoic speech is used in the replay scenario, and evaluate
the impact of omnidirectional and diffuse noise on detection performance. Using
the state-of-the-art M-ALRAD model for replay speech detection, we demonstrate
that synthetic data can support the generalization capabilities of the detector
across unseen enclosures.

Result: 研究表明，AMG显著减少了基于扩散的文本到音频生成中的记忆化现象，且未影响音频保真度或语义对齐。

Conclusion: AMG是一种有效的方法，能够在保持生成质量的同时，显著减少文本到音频扩散模型中的记忆化问题。

Abstract: A persistent challenge in generative audio models is data replication, where
the model unintentionally generates parts of its training data during
inference. In this work, we address this issue in text-to-audio diffusion
models by exploring the use of anti-memorization strategies. We adopt
Anti-Memorization Guidance (AMG), a technique that modifies the sampling
process of pre-trained diffusion models to discourage memorization. Our study
explores three types of guidance within AMG, each designed to reduce
replication while preserving generation quality. We use Stable Audio Open as
our backbone, leveraging its fully open-source architecture and training
dataset. Our comprehensive experimental analysis suggests that AMG
significantly mitigates memorization in diffusion-based text-to-audio
generation without compromising audio fidelity or semantic alignment.

Abstract: The task of Mel vocoding, i.e., the inversion of a Mel magnitude spectrogram
to an audio waveform, is still a key component in many text-to-speech (TTS)
systems today. Based on generative flow matching, our prior work on generative
STFT phase retrieval (DiffPhase), and the pseudoinverse operator of the Mel
filterbank, we develop MelFlow, a streaming-capable generative Mel vocoder for
speech sampled at 16 kHz with an algorithmic latency of only 32 ms and a total
latency of 48 ms. We show real-time streaming capability at this latency not
only in theory, but in practice on a consumer laptop GPU. Furthermore, we show
that our model achieves substantially better PESQ and SI-SDR values compared to
well-established not streaming-capable baselines for Mel vocoding including
HiFi-GAN.

TL;DR: Chameleon框架提出了一种在5G毫米波网络中实现通信与感知融合（ISAC）的新方法，通过快速切换波束成形器，同时保持用户通信和目标感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前5G网络的波束成形通常仅针对通信或感知设计，未能充分利用毫米波频谱的潜力，因此需要一种集成两者功能的高效解决方案。

Method: Chameleon在每个解调参考信号符号期间快速切换波束成形器，引入额外的感知波束，同时维持用户通信波束。该方法在28 GHz软件定义无线电测试平台上实现。

Result: 实验表明，Chameleon实现了0.80 Gbps的总数据速率，并能在0.875毫秒内完成31x31点的2D成像，同时通过机器学习实现了高精度的目标定位和材料分类。

Conclusion: Chameleon展示了毫米波网络中通信与感知高效集成的可行性，为下一代网络提供了技术支持。

Abstract: Next-generation cellular networks are envisioned to integrate sensing
capabilities with communication, particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave)
spectrum, where beamforming using large-scale antenna arrays enables
directional signal transmissions for improved spatial multiplexing. In current
5G networks, however, beamforming is typically designed either for
communication or sensing (e.g., beam training during link establishment). In
this paper, we present Chameleon, a novel framework that augments and rapidly
switches beamformers during each demodulation reference signal (DMRS) symbol to
achieve integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 5G mmWave networks. Each
beamformer introduces an additional sensing beam toward target angles while
maintaining the communication beams toward multiple users. We implement
Chameleon on a 28 GHz software-defined radio testbed supporting over-the-air 5G
physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) transmissions. Extensive experiments
in open environments show that Chameleon achieves multi-user communication with
a sum data rate of up to 0.80 Gbps across two users. Simultaneously, Chameleon
employs a beamformer switching interval of only 0.24 {\mu}s, therefore
producing a 31x31-point 2D imaging within just 0.875 ms. Leveraging machine
learning, Chameleon further enables object localization with median errors of
0.14 m (distance) and 0.24{\deg} (angle), and material classification with
99.0% accuracy.

Abstract: We propose an adaptive step-size rule for decentralized optimization.
Choosing a step-size that balances convergence and stability is challenging.
This is amplified in the decentralized setting as agents observe only local
(possibly stochastic) gradients and global information (like smoothness) is
unavailable. We derive a step-size rule from first principles. The resulting
formulation reduces to the well-known Polyak's rule in the single-agent
setting, and is suitable for use with stochastic gradients. The method is
parameter free, apart from requiring the optimal objective value, which is
readily available in many applications. Numerical simulations demonstrate that
the performance is comparable to the optimally fine-tuned step-size.

### [75] [Movable-Antenna Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Sensing: CRB Scaling Laws over Time and Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14905)
*Wenyan Ma,Lipeng Zhu,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型无线传感系统，利用移动天线（MA）通过连续运动接收信号，从而提升传感性能。研究表明，角度估计性能主要由MA轨迹决定，并推导了一维（1D）和二维（2D）天线运动下的Cramer-Rao边界（CRB）。结果显示，MA方案显著优于固定天线（FPA）方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定位置天线（FPA）传感性能有限，希望通过移动天线（MA）的动态特性提升角度估计精度。

Method: 通过分析MA轨迹对CRB的影响，推导了1D和2D情况下的最优轨迹，并设计了交替优化算法以实现局部最优解。

Result: MA方案在1D/2D情况下均显著降低CRB和实际角度估计误差，且具有高角度分辨率。

Conclusion: MA传感系统在角度估计中表现出显著优势，为未来无线传感提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new wireless sensing system utilizing a movable
antenna (MA) that continuously moves and receives sensing signals to enhance
sensing performance over the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) sensing.
We show that the angle estimation performance is fundamentally determined by
the MA trajectory, and derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square
error (MSE) for angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the
trajectory for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) antenna
movement. For the 1D case, a globally optimal trajectory that minimizes the CRB
is derived in closed form. Notably, the resulting CRB decreases cubically with
sensing time in the time-constrained regime, whereas it decreases linearly with
sensing time and quadratically with the movement line segment's length in the
space-constrained regime. For the 2D case, we aim to achieve the minimum of
maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the
horizontal and vertical axes. To this end, we design an efficient alternating
optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the MA's horizontal or vertical
coordinates with the other being fixed, yielding a locally optimal trajectory.
Numerical results show that the proposed 1D/2D MA-based sensing schemes
significantly reduce both the CRB and actual AoA estimation MSE compared to
conventional FPA-based sensing with uniform linear/planar arrays (ULAs/UPAs) as
well as various benchmark MA trajectories. Moreover, it is revealed that the
steering vectors of our designed 1D/2D MA trajectories have low correlation in
the angular domain, thereby effectively increasing the angular resolution for
achieving higher AoA estimation accuracy.

*Irtiza Hasan,Ahmed Arafa*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 研究了移动性对信息新鲜度的影响，通过优化移动成本提升了信息传播效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究移动节点在网络中如何通过接触移动性（contact mobility）提升信息新鲜度，尤其是在不同网络拓扑下的效果。

Method: 使用随机混合系统（SHS）框架分析不同拓扑和移动性对版本年龄（VAoI）的影响，并通过模拟验证理论结果。

Result: 移动性显著改善了网络的信息新鲜度，尤其是在完全断开或完全连接的极端网络中。优化后的移动成本进一步提升了平均版本年龄。

Conclusion: 接触移动性结合优化的移动成本可以有效提升网络信息传播的新鲜度。

Abstract: A gossip network is considered in which a source node updates its status
while other nodes in the network aim at keeping track of it as it varies over
time. Information gets disseminated by the source sending status updates to the
nodes, and the nodes gossiping with each other. In addition, the nodes in the
network are mobile, and can move to other nodes to get information, which we
term contact mobility. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as
possible, i.e., to have the same information as the source's. To evaluate the
freshness of information, we use the Version Age-of-Information (VAoI) metric,
defined as the difference between the version of information available at a
given node and that at the source. We analyze the effect of contact mobility on
information dissemination in the gossip network using a Stochastic Hybrid
System (SHS) framework for different topologies and mobility scalings with
increasing number of nodes. It is shown that with the presence of contact
mobility the freshness of the network improves in both ends of the network
connectivity spectrum: disconnected and fully connected gossip networks. We
mathematically analyze the average version age scalings and validate our
theoretical results via simulations. Finally, we incorporate the cost of
mobility for the network by formulating and solving an optimization problem
that minimizes a weighted sum of version age and mobility cost. Our results
show that contact mobility, with optimized mobility cost, improves the average
version age in the network.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种协同制导策略，用于拦截恒定速度、非机动目标，解决了部分拦截器不具备导引头的实际问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，仅部分拦截器配备导引头，导致目标观测能力不均，需要一种解决方案。

Method: 采用固定时间分布式观测器，使无导引头拦截器通过有导引头的代理和邻域信息估计目标状态；使用偏移追踪制导和有限时间高阶滑模一致性协议。

Result: 仿真验证了所提议的制导和估计架构的有效性。

Conclusion: 该策略成功克服了目标观测不均的问题，并实现了精确拦截。

Abstract: This paper presents a cooperative guidance strategy for the simultaneous
interception of a constant-velocity, non-maneuvering target, addressing the
realistic scenario where only a subset of interceptors are equipped with
onboard seekers. To overcome the resulting heterogeneity in target
observability, a fixed-time distributed observer is employed, enabling
seeker-less interceptors to estimate the target state using information from
seeker-equipped agents and local neighbors over a directed communication
topology. Departing from conventional strategies that approximate time-to-go
via linearization or small-angle assumptions, the proposed approach leverages
deviated pursuit guidance where the time-to-go expression is exact for such a
target. Moreover, a higher-order sliding mode consensus protocol is utilized to
establish time-to-go consensus within a finite time. The effectiveness of the
proposed guidance and estimation architecture is demonstrated through
simulations.

Motivation: 解决传统射频指纹识别系统易受复制、篡改和规避攻击的问题，提出一种更安全的认证方式。

Method: 使用ResNet-34对log-Mel频谱图进行分析，嵌入三种水印，并结合变分自编码器进行异常检测。

Result: 在LoRa数据集上，系统达到94.6%的准确率、98%的水印成功率和0.94的AUROC。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了可验证且防篡改的认证，显著提升了安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) distinguishes wireless
devices by the small variations in their analog circuits, avoiding heavy
cryptographic authentication. While deep learning on spectrograms improves
accuracy, models remain vulnerable to copying, tampering, and evasion. We
present a stronger RFFI system combining watermarking for ownership proof and
anomaly detection for spotting suspicious inputs. Using a ResNet-34 on log-Mel
spectrograms, we embed three watermarks: a simple trigger, an adversarially
trained trigger robust to noise and filtering, and a hidden gradient/weight
signature. A convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler
(KL) warm-up and free-bits flags off-distribution queries. On the LoRa dataset,
our system achieves 94.6% accuracy, 98% watermark success, and 0.94 AUROC,
offering verifiable, tamper-resistant authentication.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在高保真模拟器上训练成本高，离线强化学习受限于数据集质量和规模。多保真度混合强化学习可利用不同保真度的模拟器解决这一问题。

Method: 提出MF-HRL-IGM算法，通过信息增益最大化选择模拟器保真度，并结合引导方法进行策略优化。

Result: 理论分析证明MF-HRL-IGM具有无后悔性；实验显示其性能优于现有基准。

Conclusion: MF-HRL-IGM在固定成本下实现高效策略优化，为多保真度强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy typically requires extensive
interactions with a high-fidelity simulator of the environment, which are often
costly or impractical. Offline RL addresses this problem by allowing training
from pre-collected data, but its effectiveness is strongly constrained by the
size and quality of the dataset. Hybrid offline-online RL leverages both
offline data and interactions with a single simulator of the environment. In
many real-world scenarios, however, multiple simulators with varying levels of
fidelity and computational cost are available. In this work, we study
multi-fidelity hybrid RL for policy optimization under a fixed cost budget. We
introduce multi-fidelity hybrid RL via information gain maximization
(MF-HRL-IGM), a hybrid offline-online RL algorithm that implements fidelity
selection based on information gain maximization through a bootstrapping
approach. Theoretical analysis establishes the no-regret property of
MF-HRL-IGM, while empirical evaluations demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing benchmarks.

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，传统方法在部分观测下仍能恢复观测节点的真实图拓扑。

Conclusion: 传统的图拓扑学习方法对隐藏节点和部分观测具有隐式鲁棒性，适用于低通滤波图信号。

Abstract: Learning the graph underlying a networked system from nodal signals is
crucial to downstream tasks in graph signal processing and machine learning.
The presence of hidden nodes whose signals are not observable might corrupt the
estimated graph. While existing works proposed various robustifications of
vanilla graph learning objectives by explicitly accounting for the presence of
these hidden nodes, a robustness analysis of "naive", hidden-node agnostic
approaches is still underexplored. This work demonstrates that vanilla graph
topology learning methods are implicitly robust to partial observations of
low-pass filtered graph signals. We achieve this theoretical result through
extending the restricted isometry property (RIP) to the Dirichlet energy
function used in graph learning objectives. We show that smoothness-based graph
learning formulation (e.g., the GL-SigRep method) on partial observations can
recover the ground truth graph topology corresponding to the observed nodes.
Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate our findings.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but
their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral
cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning
stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage
post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral
cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage,
Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a
well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of
robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human
supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot
embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on
Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT
and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling
imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to
policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight
that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key
to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination
uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously
practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors
observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These
findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained
foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill
acquisition in robotics. Our project website can be found at

Motivation: 解决现有参数化表示方法中高适应性模型计算代价大，而实时方法自由度低难以实现高精度的问题。

Method: 先使用高斯混合模型分割点云为多簇，再筛选合并平坦簇为平面或曲面，平面用2D体素边界描述，曲面用B样条拟合并应用相同边界描述。

Conclusion: 该多模型参数化表示方法在效率和精度上均有显著提升，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商仓库中物品种类快速增长，导致自动化包装中物品识别的挑战增加，包括类内变异性大、遮挡和视角变化等，现有方法性能下降。

Method: RoboEye分为两阶段：1) 提取2D特征生成候选排名；2) 动态3D特征增强，通过3D检索变换器实现关键点匹配。

Result: 实验显示RoboEye将Recall@1提升了7.1%，优于现有技术RoboLLM，且仅需RGB图像，无需显式3D输入。

Conclusion: RoboEye通过结合2D和3D特征显著提升了物品识别性能，且部署成本低。

Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code
used in this paper is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 该预训练策略为视觉-语言-动作模型提供了更有效的初始化方法。

Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built
upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We
propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric
Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric
manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame
and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware
Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories,
thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction.
Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a
variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact
latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When
finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the
proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA
models.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous
systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and
virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free
observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight
objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera
coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised
trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable
prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present
advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the
noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.
Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight
Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending
its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual
reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera
calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of
visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an
unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB
datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory
denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.
Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such
as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,
providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative
to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor
trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances. The

Conclusion: 研究为设计更可解释和鲁棒的歌唱声音深度伪造检测系统提供了依据。

Abstract: Although many models exist to detect singing voice deepfakes (SingFake), how
these models operate, particularly with instrumental accompaniment, is unclear.
We investigate how instrumental music affects SingFake detection from two
perspectives. To investigate the behavioral effect, we test different
backbones, unpaired instrumental tracks, and frequency subbands. To analyze the
representational effect, we probe how fine-tuning alters encoders' speech and
music capabilities. Our results show that instrumental accompaniment acts
mainly as data augmentation rather than providing intrinsic cues (e.g., rhythm
or harmony). Furthermore, fine-tuning increases reliance on shallow speaker
features while reducing sensitivity to content, paralinguistic, and semantic
information. These insights clarify how models exploit vocal versus
instrumental cues and can inform the design of more interpretable and robust
SingFake detection systems.
