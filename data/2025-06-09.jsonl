Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted microwave radiometry\npresents a promising alternative, but most evaluations to date have focused on\nagricultural settings, with limited exploration across other land covers and\nfew efforts to quantify retrieval uncertainty. This study addresses both gaps\nby evaluating SM retrievals from a drone-based Portable L-band Radiometer\n(PoLRa) across shrubland, bare soil, and forest strips in Central Illinois,\nU.S., using a 10-day field campaign in 2024. Controlled UAV flights at\naltitudes of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m were performed to generate brightness\ntemperatures (TB) at spatial resolutions of 7 m, 14 m, and 21 m. SM retrievals\nwere carried out using multiple tau-omega-based algorithms, including the\nsingle channel algorithm (SCA), dual channel algorithm (DCA), and\nmulti-temporal dual channel algorithm (MTDCA). A Bayesian inference framework\nwas then applied to provide probabilistic uncertainty characterization for both\nSM and vegetation optical depth (VOD). Results show that the gridded TB\ndistributions consistently capture dry-wet gradients associated with vegetation\ndensity variations, and spatial correlations between polarized observations are\nlargely maintained across scales. Validation against in situ measurements\nindicates that PoLRa derived SM retrievals from the SCAV and MTDCA algorithms\nachieve unbiased root-mean-square errors (ubRMSE) generally below 0.04 m3/m3\nacross different land covers. Bayesian posterior analyses confirm that\nreference SM values largely fall within the derived uncertainty intervals, with\nmean uncertainty ranges around 0.02 m3/m3 and 0.11 m3/m3 for SCA and DCA\nrelated retrievals."}

To address these\nchallenges in a principled manner, we propose a novel wireless FL framework\ngrounded in Bayesian inference. By virtue of the Bayesian approach, our\nframework captures model uncertainty by maintaining distributions over local\nweights and performs distribution-level aggregation of local distributions into\na global distribution. This mitigates local overfitting and client drift,\nthereby enabling more reliable inference. Nevertheless, adopting Bayesian FL\nincreases communication overhead due to the need to transmit richer model\ninformation and fundamentally alters the aggregation process beyond simple\naveraging. As a result, conventional Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp), widely\nused to improve communication efficiency in standard FL, is no longer directly\napplicable. To overcome this limitation, we design a dedicated AirComp scheme\ntailored to Bayesian FL, which efficiently aggregates local posterior\ndistributions at the distribution level by exploiting the superposition\nproperty of wireless channels. In addition, we derive an optimal transmit power\ncontrol strategy, grounded in rigorous convergence analysis, to accelerate\ntraining under power constraints.

By enabling\ndynamic activation at arbitrary positions along a dielectric waveguide,\npinching antennas offer unprecedented channel reconfigurability and the ability\nto provide line-of-sight (LoS) links in scenarios with severe LoS blockages.\nThe performance of pinching-antenna systems is highly dependent on the\noptimized placement of the pinching antennas, which must be jointly considered\nwith traditional resource allocation (RA) variables -- including transmission\npower, time slots, and subcarriers. The resulting joint RA problems are\ntypically non-convex with complex variable coupling, necessitating\nsophisticated optimization techniques. This article provides a comprehensive\nsurvey of existing RA algorithms designed for pinching-antenna systems,\nsupported by numerical case studies that demonstrate their potential\nperformance gains. Key challenges and open research problems are also\nidentified to guide future developments in this emerging field."}

We investigate how depression alters\nthe temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to\nself-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG)\nin healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant\ngroup-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting\ndisrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in\ndepression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area\nunder the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy\nfrom depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups\nwith and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior\nelectrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key\ncontributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures\nof depression that may inform future diagnostic tools."}

The Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters\nhandle nonlinearity through linearization and unscented transformation,\nrespectively, but remain linear estimators, meaning that the state estimate is\na linear function of the measurement. This paper proposes a quadratic\napproximation of the optimal estimator, creating the Quadratic Extended and\nQuadratic Unscented Kalman Filter. These retain the structure of their linear\ncounterpart, but include information from the measurement square to obtain a\nmore accurate estimate. Numerical results show the benefits in accuracy of the\nnew technique, which can be generalized to upgrade other linear estimators to\ntheir quadratic versions."}
