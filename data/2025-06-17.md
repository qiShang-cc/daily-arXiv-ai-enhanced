Abstract: Wi-Fi technology has evolved from simple communication routers to sensing
devices. Wi-Fi sensing leverages conventional Wi-Fi transmissions to extract
and analyze channel state information (CSI) for applications like proximity
detection, occupancy detection, activity recognition, and health monitoring. By
leveraging existing infrastructure, Wi-Fi sensing offers a privacy-preserving,
non-intrusive, and cost-effective solution which, unlike cameras, is not
sensitive to lighting conditions. Beginning with a comprehensive review of the
Wi-Fi standardization activities, this tutorial-cum-survey first introduces
fundamental concepts related to Wi-Fi CSI, outlines the CSI measurement
methods, and examines the impact of mobile objects on CSI. The mechanics of a
simplified testbed for CSI extraction are also described. Then, we present a
qualitative comparison of the existing Wi-Fi sensing datasets, their
specifications, and pin-point their shortcomings. Next, a variety of
preprocessing techniques are discussed that are beneficial for feature
extraction and explainability of machine learning (ML) algorithms. We then
provide a qualitative review of recent ML approaches in the domain of Wi-Fi
sensing and present the significance of self-supervised learning (SSL) in that
context. Specifically, the mechanics of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning solutions is elaborated in detail and a quantitative comparative
analysis is presented in terms of classification accuracy. Finally, the article
concludes by highlighting emerging technologies that can be leveraged to
enhance the performance of Wi-Fi sensing and opportunities for further research
in this domain

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对DAG的新型图神经网络架构DCN及其并行版本PDCN，利用因果图过滤器学习节点表示，并通过分离模型复杂度与图大小的关系实现高效预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络（GNN）缺乏对DAG部分顺序的建模能力，DCN通过因果图过滤器和谱域表示解决了这一问题。

Method: DCN基于形式化卷积操作，支持谱域表示；PDCN通过并行因果图移位操作和共享MLP分离模型复杂度与图大小。

Result: 实验表明（P）DCN在准确性、鲁棒性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: （P）DCN为DAG结构化数据的深度学习提供了高效且理论支持的框架。

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are central to science and engineering
applications including causal inference, scheduling, and neural architecture
search. In this work, we introduce the DAG Convolutional Network (DCN), a novel
graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed specifically for convolutional
learning from signals supported on DAGs. The DCN leverages causal graph filters
to learn nodal representations that account for the partial ordering inherent
to DAGs, a strong inductive bias does not present in conventional GNNs. Unlike
prior art in machine learning over DAGs, DCN builds on formal convolutional
operations that admit spectral-domain representations. We further propose the
Parallel DCN (PDCN), a model that feeds input DAG signals to a parallel bank of
causal graph-shift operators and processes these DAG-aware features using a
shared multilayer perceptron. This way, PDCN decouples model complexity from
graph size while maintaining satisfactory predictive performance. The
architectures' permutation equivariance and expressive power properties are
also established. Comprehensive numerical tests across several tasks, datasets,
and experimental conditions demonstrate that (P)DCN compares favorably with
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational
efficiency. These results position (P)DCN as a viable framework for deep
learning from DAG-structured data that is designed from first (graph) signal
processing principles.

control systems. Finally, we identify potential applications and key
cross-layer challenges. This article offers a comprehensive roadmap for future
research and development in the low-altitude airspace.

### [5] [A Smooshed BMOCZ Zero Constellation for CFO Estimation Without Channel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12599)
*Anthony Joseph Perre,Parker Huggins,Alphan Sahin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的二进制调制方法（SBMOCZ），通过调整零点分布来解决载波频率偏移问题，性能略有下降但优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决载波频率偏移（CFO）导致的零点旋转问题，无需依赖信道编码。

Method: 修改Huffman BMOCZ的相位映射，缩小相邻零点间的角度以引入间隙，接收端通过检测间隙位置估计并校正相位旋转。

Result: SBMOCZ在无CFO时性能略有下降，但在存在CFO时有效解决旋转问题；在衰落信道中比Huffman BMOCZ提升4 dB的误码率性能。

Conclusion: SBMOCZ在解决CFO问题方面优于传统方法，尤其在衰落信道中表现突出。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a new binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal
zeros (BMOCZ) zero constellation, which we call smooshed binary modulation on
conjugate-reciprocal zeros (SBMOCZ), to address carrier frequency offset
(CFO)-induced zero rotation without depending on channel coding. In our
approach, we modify the phase mapping of Huffman BMOCZ by shrinking the angle
between adjacent zeros, except for the first and last, to introduce a gap in
the zero constellation. By discerning the gap location in the received
polynomial, the receiver can estimate and correct the phase rotation. We
demonstrate the error rate performance of SBMOCZ relative to Huffman BMOCZ,
showing that SBMOCZ addresses a CFO-induced rotation at the cost of a modest
performance reduction compared to Huffman BMOCZ in the absence of a CFO.
Finally, we compare SBMOCZ to Huffman BMOCZ using a cyclically permutable code
(CPC), showing a 4 dB bit error rate (BER) improvement in a fading channel,
while demonstrating comparable performance across other simulations.

### [6] [Semi-Blind Channel Estimation for Downlink Communications Based on Dynamic Metasurface Antennas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12639)
*Amarilton L. Magalhães,André L. F. de Almeida,A. Lee Swindlehurst*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态超表面天线（DMA）的简单信道估计方案，用于MISO-OFDM系统，通过迭代算法分离无线信道和波导传播向量的估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态超表面天线（DMA）因其高效能和可扩展性成为多天线系统的关键技术，但信道估计问题亟待解决。

Result: 数值结果表明该方案性能显著，能够有效隔离和补偿波导传播向量的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的方案首次探索了基于DMA的信道估计方法，为多天线系统提供了高效且灵活的信道估计解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are emerging as a promising technology to
enable energy-efficient, large array-based multi-antenna systems. This paper
presents a simple channel estimation scheme for the downlink of a
multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MISO-OFDM) communication system exploiting DMAs. The proposed scheme extracts
separate estimates of the wireless channel and the unknown waveguide
propagation vector using a simple iterative algorithm based on the parallel
factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. Obtaining decoupled estimates of the wireless
channel and inner waveguide vector enables the isolation and compensation for
its effect when designing the DMA beamformer, regardless of the wireless
channel state, which evolves much faster due to its shorter coherence time and
bandwidth. Additionally, our solution operates in a data-aided manner,
delivering estimates of useful data symbols jointly with channel estimates,
without requiring sequential pilot and data stages. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to explore this CE approach. Numerical
results corroborate the notable performance of the proposed scheme.

Conclusion: 该方法为双RIS系统的信道获取提供了新范式，能以低开销提高信道获取质量。

Abstract: With the development of the upcoming sixth-generation networks (6G),
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have gained significant attention
due to its ability of reconfiguring wireless channels via smart reflections.
However, traditional channel state information (CSI) acquisition techniques for
double-RIS systems face challenges (e.g., high pilot overhead or multipath
interference). This paper proposes a new channel generation method in
double-RIS communication systems based on the tool of conditional diffusion
model (CDM). The CDM is trained on synthetic channel data to capture channel
characteristics. It addresses the limitations of traditional CSI generation
methods, such as insufficient model understanding capability and poor
environmental adaptability. We provide a detailed analysis of the diffusion
process for channel generation, and it is validated through simulations. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CDM based method outperforms
traditional channel acquisition methods in terms of normalized mean squared
error (NMSE). This method offers a new paradigm for channel acquisition in
double-RIS systems, which is expected to improve the quality of channel
acquisition with low pilot overhead.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as transformative
technologies, enhancing spectral efficiency and improving interference
management in multi-user cooperative communications. This paper investigates
the integration of RIS with Flexible-Duplex (FlexD) communication, featuring
dynamic scheduling capabilities, to mitigate unintended external interference
in multi-user wireless networks. By leveraging the reconfigurability of RIS and
dynamic scheduling, we propose a user-pair selection scheme to maximize system
throughput when full channel state information (CSI) of interference is
unavailable. We develop a mathematical framework to evaluate the throughput
outage probability when RIS introduces spatial correlation. The derived
analytical results are used for asymptotic analysis, providing insights into
dynamic user scheduling under interference based on statistical channel
knowledge. Finally, we compare FlexD with traditional Full Duplex (FD) and Half
Duplex (HD) systems against RIS-assisted FlexD. Our results show FlexD's
superior throughput enhancement, energy efficiency and data management
capability in interference-affected networks, typical in current and
next-generation cooperative wireless applications like cellular and vehicular
communications.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) within sub-THz frequencies is
crucial for future air-ground networks, but unique propagation characteristics
and hardware limitations present challenges in optimizing ISAC performance
while increasing operational latency. This paper introduces a multi-modal
sensing fusion framework inspired by synesthesia of machine (SoM) to enhance
sub-THz ISAC transmission. By exploiting inherent degrees of freedom in sub-THz
hardware and channels, the framework optimizes the radio-frequency environment.
Squint-aware beam management is developed to improve air-ground network
adaptability, enabling three-dimensional dynamic ISAC links. Leveraging
multi-modal information, the framework enhances ISAC performance and reduces
latency. Visual data rapidly localizes users and targets, while a customized
multi-modal learning algorithm optimizes the hybrid precoder. A new metric
provides comprehensive performance evaluation, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves ISAC efficiency.

### [10] [Low-Latency Terrestrial Interference Detection for Satellite-to-Device Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12908)
*Runnan Liu,Weifeng Zhu,Shu Sun,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了针对卫星到设备通信中干扰的在线检测框架，包括已知干扰方向的CUSUM方法和未知方向的GLR方法，实现了高精度和低延迟检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星到设备通信中，地面干扰的不确定性和间歇性影响了系统性能，需高效的在线干扰检测方法。

Result: 数值实验验证了方法的理论性能，实现了高检测精度和低延迟。

Conclusion: 提出的方法适用于未来卫星到设备通信，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Direct satellite-to-device communication is a promising future direction due
to its lower latency and enhanced efficiency. However, intermittent and
unpredictable terrestrial interference significantly affects system reliability
and performance. Continuously employing sophisticated interference mitigation
techniques is practically inefficient. Motivated by the periodic idle intervals
characteristic of burst-mode satellite transmissions, this paper investigates
online interference detection frameworks specifically tailored for
satellite-to-device scenarios. We first rigorously formulate interference
detection as a binary hypothesis testing problem, leveraging differences
between Rayleigh (no interference) and Rice (interference present)
distributions. Then, we propose a cumulative sum (CUSUM)-based online detector
for scenarios with known interference directions, explicitly characterizing the
trade-off between detection latency and false alarm rate, and establish its
asymptotic optimality. For practical scenarios involving unknown interference
direction, we further propose a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)-based
detection method, jointly estimating interference direction via the Root-MUSIC
algorithm. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate
that our proposed methods achieve high detection accuracy with remarkably low
latency, highlighting their practical applicability in future
satellite-to-device communication systems.

Conclusion: 结论表明，基于统计CSI和考虑硬件缺陷的优化方法在实际STAR-RIS网络中具有高效性和优越性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate real-time interference mitigation in multiuser
wireless networks assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). Unlike conventional methods
that rely on instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we consider a
practical scenario where only statistical CSI is available, and the STAR-RIS
phase shifts are impaired by random phase errors modeled via the Von Mises
distribution. To tackle the resulting nonconvex optimization problem induced by
unit-modulus constraints and stochastic interference, we derive a closed-form
approximation of the effective channel matrix using statistical expectations.
We then reformulate the interference minimization problem as an unconstrained
optimization over a Riemannian manifold and propose a conjugate gradient
algorithm tailored to the complex circle manifold. The proposed solution
enables efficient real-time computation of optimal phase shifts while
accounting for hardware imperfections and limited CSI. Simulation results
confirm that our method significantly suppresses inter-user interference and
achieves superior SINR performance and convergence speed compared to
conventional baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Wi-Fi信道状态信息(CSI)在真实场景中活动识别的泛化能力不足，需要一种能有效处理噪声和静态环境的方法。

Result: 在数据集上验证了该方法在手势识别上的优越性，加入少量校准样本后可显著提升准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为Wi-Fi感知在真实场景中的部署提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The newly established IEEE 802.11bf Task Group aims to amend the WLAN
standard to support advanced sensing applications such as human activity
recognition (HAR). Although studies have demonstrated the potential of sub-7
GHz Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) for HAR, no method currently performs
reliably in real-world scenarios. This work tackles the poor generalization of
Wi-Fi-based HAR by introducing an innovative approach to extracting and
utilizing movement-related representations, which makes it robust to noise and
static environmental properties. This is achieved by transforming CSI signals
into the delay profile space and decomposing them into various Doppler
velocities, which serve as informative projections of a mobile point's velocity
from different unknown random angles. To mitigate the impact of this
randomness, MORIC is introduced as a novel time series classification model
based on random convolutional kernels, designed to be invariant to the random
order and repetition of input representations, thereby enabling robust Wi-Fi
CSI-based activity classification. Experimental results on the collected
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches in terms of generalization accuracy for hand motion recognition,
particularly for challenging gestures. Furthermore, incorporating a small
number of calibration samples leads to a significant improvement in accuracy,
enhancing the practicality of the method for real-world deployment.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在频谱效率和通信成功率上分别比基线方案提升了42.9%和4.4%。

Conclusion: 提出的DRL方法能有效解决水下通信中的资源分配问题，提升系统性能。

Abstract: Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications generally rely on cognitive radio
(CR)-based ad-hoc networks due to challenges such as long propagation delay,
limited channel resources, and high attenuation. To address the constraints of
limited frequency resources, UWA communications have recently incorporated
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), significantly enhancing
spectral efficiency (SE) through multiplexing gains. Still, {the} low
propagation speed of UWA signals, combined with {the} dynamic underwater
environment, creates asynchrony in multiple access scenarios. This causes
inaccurate spectrum sensing as inter-carrier interference (ICI) increases,
which leads to difficulties in resource allocation. As efficient resource
allocation is essential for achieving high-quality communication in OFDMA-based
CR networks, these challenges degrade communication reliability in UWA systems.
To resolve the issue, we propose an end-to-end sensing and resource
optimization method using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in an OFDMA-based
UWA-CR network. Through extensive simulations, we confirm that the proposed
method is superior to baseline schemes, outperforming other methods by 42.9 %
in SE and 4.4 % in communication success rate.

Abstract: Sensing emerges as a critical challenge in 6G networks, which require
simultaneous communication and target sensing capabilities. State-of-the-art
super-resolution techniques for the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation
encounter significant performance limitations when the number of targets

approach implements a strategic two-stage methodology: first, discriminating
targets through delay and Doppler domain filtering to reduce the number of
effective targets for super-resolution DoA estimation, and second, introducing
a fusion technique to mitigate sidelobe interferences. The algorithm enables
robust DoA estimation, particularly in high-density target environments with
limited-size antenna arrays. Numerical simulations validate the superior
performance of the proposed method compared to conventional DoA estimation
approaches.

Abstract: Fusion of passive and active measurements from sensor nodes becomes critical
in localizing underwater objects and is traditionally achieved by communicating
information to a central node. This causes significant inefficiencies in
bandwidth, energy, and processing time, which are critical in marine
applications. With integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the
process of sensing, localization, and communication can be achieved jointly,
and the inefficiencies can be minimized. Thus, the primary objective of this
study is to analyse the efficacy of such communication signals in localizing a
moving target in given underwater conditions. The Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound
(CRLB) is a performance metric used to determine the theoretical lower bound on
localization errors. Simulation results illustrate the contours of localization
error across various scenarios, offering valuable insights into system
performance under different target dynamics and sea state conditions,
showcasing their potential for efficient and reliable underwater localization
applications.

Method: 为NOMA和FDMA提出两阶段算法（SCA方法和相位微调）；为TDMA利用时隙特性优化波束成形。

Result: PASS性能优于传统天线系统；NOMA优于FDMA，TDMA在对称速率需求下表现最佳。

Conclusion: PASS在多址方案中表现优异，TDMA在对称需求下更具优势。

Abstract: A fundamental two-user PASS-based communication system is considered under
three MA schemes, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency
division multiple access (FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA). For
each MA scheme, a pinching beamforming optimization problem is formulated to
minimize the required transmit power for satisfying users' rate requirements.
For NOMA and FDMA, a two-stage algorithm is proposed, where the locations of
PAs are derived sequentially by using the successive convex approximation (SCA)
method and fine-turning phase adjustment. For TDMA, by leveraging the
time-switching feature of PASS, the optimal pinching beamforming of each time
slot is derived to maximize the served user channel gain. Numerical results are
provided to show that: 1) PASS can achieve a significant performance gain over
conventional antenna systems, and 2) NOMA consistently outperforms FDMA, while
TDMA provides superior performance than NOMA for symmetric user rate
requirements.

Abstract: As the demand for ubiquitous connectivity and high-precision environmental
awareness grows, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a
key technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Intelligent
metasurfaces (IMs) have also been widely adopted in ISAC scenarios due to their
efficient, programmable control over electromagnetic waves. This provides a
versatile solution that meets the dual-function requirements of next-generation
networks. Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been
extensively studied for manipulating the propagation channel between base and
mobile stations, the full potential of IMs in ISAC transceiver design remains
under-explored. Against this backdrop, this article explores emerging
IM-enabled transceiver designs for ISAC systems. It begins with an overview of
representative IM architectures, their unique principles, and their inherent
advantages in EM wave manipulation. Next, a unified ISAC framework is
established to systematically model the design and derivation of diverse
IM-enabled transceiver structures. This lays the foundation for performance
optimization, trade-offs, and analysis. The paper then discusses several
critical technologies for IM-enabled ISAC transceivers, including dedicated
channel modeling, effective channel estimation, tailored beamforming
strategies, and dual-functional waveform design.

Result: 实验表明，该方法对云覆盖的鲁棒性显著提高，且在没有云的情况下性能不下降。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在遥感图像融合中表现出优越的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Multiresolution image fusion is a key problem for real-time satellite imaging
and plays a central role in detecting and monitoring natural phenomena such as
floods. It aims to solve the trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution
in remote sensing instruments. Although several algorithms have been proposed
for this problem, the presence of outliers such as clouds downgrades their
performance. Moreover, strategies that integrate robustness, recursive
operation and learned models are missing. In this paper, a robust recursive
image fusion framework leveraging location-aware neural networks (NN) to model
the image dynamics is proposed. Outliers are modeled by representing the
probability of contamination of a given pixel and band. A NN model trained on a
small dataset provides accurate predictions of the stochastic image time
evolution, which improves both the accuracy and robustness of the method. A
recursive solution is proposed to estimate the high-resolution images using a
Bayesian variational inference framework. Experiments fusing images from the
Landsat 8 and MODIS instruments show that the proposed approach is
significantly more robust against cloud cover, without losing performance when
no clouds are present.

Motivation: 现有神经网络推理工具大多无法满足实时音频应用的需求，因此开发anira以提供高效、兼容性强的解决方案。

Method: anira支持ONNX Runtime、LibTorch和TensorFlow Lite作为后端，通过静态线程池解耦推理和音频回调，并结合内置延迟管理和基准测试功能。

Result: 实验表明，对于无状态模型，ONNX Runtime运行时间最短；对于有状态模型，LibTorch性能最佳。某些模型-引擎组合的首批推理时间较长。

Conclusion: anira能够有效解决实时音频应用中的神经网络推理问题，不同后端在不同场景下表现各异，需根据模型类型选择合适的后端。

Abstract: Numerous tools for neural network inference are currently available, yet many
do not meet the requirements of real-time audio applications. In response, we
introduce anira, an efficient cross-platform library. To ensure compatibility
with a broad range of neural network architectures and frameworks, anira
supports ONNX Runtime, LibTorch, and TensorFlow Lite as backends. Each
inference engine exhibits real-time violations, which anira mitigates by
decoupling the inference from the audio callback to a static thread pool. The
library incorporates built-in latency management and extensive benchmarking
capabilities, both crucial to ensure a continuous signal flow. Three different
neural network architectures for audio effect emulation are then subjected to
benchmarking across various configurations. Statistical modeling is employed to
identify the influence of various factors on performance. The findings indicate
that for stateless models, ONNX Runtime exhibits the lowest runtimes. For
stateful models, LibTorch demonstrates the fastest performance. Our results
also indicate that for certain model-engine combinations, the initial
inferences take longer, particularly when these inferences exhibit a higher
incidence of real-time violations.

Conclusion: TRON提供了一个领域无关的框架，适用于大气建模、地质灾害监测等实时环境风险预测应用。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of latent environmental fields from sparse and
indirect observations is a foundational challenge across scientific
domains-from atmospheric science and geophysics to public health and aerospace
safety. Traditional approaches rely on physics-based simulators or dense sensor
networks, both constrained by high computational cost, latency, or limited
spatial coverage. We present the Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON), a
spatiotemporal neural operator architecture designed to infer continuous global
scalar fields from sequences of sparse, non-uniform proxy measurements.
  Unlike recent forecasting models that operate on dense, gridded inputs to
predict future states, TRON addresses a more ill-posed inverse problem:
reconstructing the current global field from sparse, temporally evolving sensor
sequences, without access to future observations or dense labels. Demonstrated
on global cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON is trained on 22 years of
simulation data and generalizes across 65,341 spatial locations, 8,400 days,
and sequence lengths from 7 to 90 days. It achieves sub-second inference with
relative L2 errors below 0.1%, representing a >58,000X speedup over Monte
Carlo-based estimators. Though evaluated in the context of cosmic radiation,
TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction
from sparse data, with applications in atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard
monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting.

Abstract: We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification
tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as
points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset
\mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a
variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to
embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric
graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to
distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem
into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is
solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a
theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this
data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from
$\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes
with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training
procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during
training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further,
vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical
experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently gained attention in deep learning for
their ability to efficiently model long-range dependencies, making them
promising candidates for edge-AI applications. In this paper, we analyze the
effects of quantization on small-scale SSMs with a focus on reducing memory and
computational costs while maintaining task performance. Using the S4D
architecture, we first investigate post-training quantization (PTQ) and show
that the state matrix A and internal state x are particularly sensitive to
quantization. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different quantization
techniques applied to the parameters and activations in the S4D architecture.
To address the observed performance drop after Post-training Quantization
(PTQ), we apply Quantization-aware Training (QAT), significantly improving
performance from 40% (PTQ) to 96% on the sequential MNIST benchmark at 8-bit
precision. We further demonstrate the potential of QAT in enabling sub-8-bit
precisions and evaluate different parameterization schemes for QAT stability.
Additionally, we propose a heterogeneous quantization strategy that assigns
different precision levels to model components, reducing the overall memory
footprint by a factor of 6x without sacrificing performance. Our results
provide actionable insights for deploying quantized SSMs in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Recent studies have focused on leveraging large-scale artificial intelligence
(LAI) models to improve semantic representation and compression capabilities.
However, the substantial computational demands of LAI models pose significant
challenges for real-time communication scenarios. To address this, this paper
proposes utilizing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques to extract and
condense knowledge from LAI models, effectively reducing model complexity and
computation latency. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of LAI models leads
to prolonged inference times during distillation, while their lack of channel
awareness compromises the distillation performance. These limitations make
standard KD methods unsuitable for task-oriented semantic communication
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a fast distillation method
featuring a pre-stored compression mechanism that eliminates the need for
repetitive inference, significantly improving efficiency. Furthermore, a
channel adaptive module is incorporated to dynamically adjust the transmitted
semantic information based on varying channel conditions, enhancing
communication reliability and adaptability. In addition, an information
bottleneck-based loss function is derived to guide the fast distillation
process. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperform
baselines in term of task accuracy, model size, computation latency, and
training data requirements.

still necessitates the transmission of substantial amounts of data when dealing
with complex scene information. In contrast, the stacked intelligent
metasurface (SIM), leveraging wave-domain computing, provides a cost-effective
solution for directly imaging complex scenes. Building on this concept, we
propose an innovative SIM-aided multi-modal SemCom system. Specifically, an SIM
is positioned in front of the transmit antenna for transmitting visual semantic
information of complex scenes via imaging on the uniform planar array at the
receiver. Furthermore, the simple scene description that contains textual
semantic information is transmitted via amplitude-phase modulation over
electromagnetic waves. To simultaneously transmit multi-modal information, we
optimize the amplitude and phase of meta-atoms in the SIM using a customized
gradient descent algorithm. The optimization aims to gradually minimize the
mean squared error between the normalized energy distribution on the receiver
array and the desired pattern corresponding to the visual semantic information.
By combining the textual and visual semantic information, a conditional
generative adversarial network is used to recover the complex scene accurately.
Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
multi-modal SemCom system in reducing bandwidth overhead as well as the
capability of the SIM for imaging the complex scene.

Conclusion: 提出了一种更准确评估干扰影响的框架，为接收机设计和性能评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not
optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or
computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance
complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used
performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information, fail to capture
the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate
performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool
for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use
mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat
interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics.
Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under
interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be
matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched
capacity is derived using Mutual Information (MI), while a lower bound on the
mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using the
Generalized Mutual Information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the
proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in
Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that
GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput performance of BICM-type systems.
Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases,
with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder
optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In
short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference,
proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance
evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference.

Result: 数值结果表明，SIC-free RSMA在加权和速率与MMF性能上损失较小。

Conclusion: SIC-free RSMA可作为未来无线通信系统的可行方案。

Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising
multiple access technique for future wireless communication systems. Recent
research demonstrates that RSMA can maintain its superiority without relying on
Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) receivers. In practical systems,
SIC-free receivers are more attractive than SIC receivers because of their low
complexity and latency. This paper evaluates the theoretical limits of RSMA
with and without SIC receivers under finite constellations. We first derive the
constellation-constrained rate expressions for RSMA. We then design algorithms
based on projected subgradient ascent to optimize the precoders and maximize
the weighted sum-rate or max-min fairness (MMF) among users. To apply the
proposed optimization algorithms to large-scale systems, one challenge lies in
the exponentially increasing computational complexity brought about by the
constellation-constrained rate expressions. In light of this, we propose
methods to avoid such computational burden. Numerical results show that, under
optimized precoders, SIC-free RSMA leads to minor losses in weighted sum-rate
and MMF performance in comparison to RSMA with SIC receivers, making it a
viable option for future implementations.

Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the
visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent
evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an
unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a
technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial
intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining
human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous
intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource
consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To
address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary
framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a
particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud
framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,
and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model
inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to
a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling
effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource
constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based
intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging
communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI
models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses
the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced
intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI
services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and
communication systems.
