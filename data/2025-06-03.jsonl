A\ncommonly adopted workflow separates training into a centralized pre-training\nphase and a federated fine-tuning phase on domain-specific data; however,\nover-the-air (OTA) gradient aggregation during fine-tuning remains vulnerable\nto fading and interference. This study explores the integration of movable\nantennas (MAs), whose element positions can be reconfigured in real time, to\nmitigate such channel impairments. An auxiliary channel representation embeds\ntransmit power terms in the effective gain, thereby removing explicit\npower-control variables. We derive the convergence bound that determines the\nrelationship between the final fine-tuning loss to OTA noise and the\ndistribution shift between the two data stages, measured via the Wasserstein\ndistance. These findings lead to a mixed integer, nonconvex resource allocation\nproblem that jointly determines the numbers of global rounds, CPU frequencies,\nmini-batch sizes, positions of MAs, and beamformers under latency-energy\nconstraints.

Unlike\nlegacy systems such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) or\nterrestrial networks (TNs), LEO-based systems experience large Doppler shifts\nand delay spreads, where traditional orthogonalization methods become\nineffective. Compared to commonly used sequences such as Gold and Zadoff-Chu\n(ZC), Bj\\\"orck sequences offer improved ambiguity function behavior, nearly\nideal autocorrelation, greater resilience to interference, and accurate delay\nestimation in high Doppler environments. We further propose a novel sequence\nconstruction method to extend Bj\\\"orck sequences to non-prime lengths while\nminimizing cyclic autocorrelation. Focusing on LEO-based non-terrestrial\nnetwork (NTN) localization, we evaluate positioning accuracy under various\ninterference conditions, comparing the performance of Bj\\\"orck sequences\nagainst Gold sequences, which are traditionally used for PRS generation. While\nBj\\\"orck sequences demonstrate strong performance in Doppler-rich environments,\nwe identify an inherent Doppler-dependent behavior that may lead to sequence\nmisidentification.

We exploit analog beamforming to reduce the number of\nradio frequency (RF) chains. We first develop a comprehensive near-field ELAA\nchannel model that accounts for the antenna radiation pattern and free space\npath loss. Due to the large aperture of the ELAA, the angular resolution of the\narray is high, which improves user localization accuracy. However, it also\nmakes the user localization problem highly non-convex, posing significant\nchallenges when the number of RF chains is limited. To address this issue, we\nuse an array partitioning strategy to divide the ELAA channel into multiple\nsubarray channels and utilize the geometric constraints between user locations\nand subarrays for probabilistic modeling. To fully exploit these geometric\nconstraints, we propose the array partitioning-based location estimation with\nlimited measurements (APLE-LM) algorithm based on the message passing principle\nto achieve multiuser localization.

Specifically, through multi-source cooperation, true and false\nsignals are transmitted over multiple frequency bands using non-orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing. The decoy signals are used to deceive\nnon-cooperative eavesdropper, while the true signals are hidden to counter\ninterception threats.

To improve\nthe secrecy performance of true signals while ensuring decoy signals achieve\ntheir deceptive purpose, we model the problem as maximizing the sum secrecy\nrate of true signals, with constraint on the decoy effect.

To fill this gap, we\nstudy how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a\nnovel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that\nfocus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation\ncharacterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data.

However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to\nproduce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct\ntemporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal\nstructures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual\nguidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through\nhuman listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these\nprinciples, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually\nintermediate morphs.
