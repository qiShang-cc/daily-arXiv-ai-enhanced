Unlike human-oriented communications, robot-oriented D2C communications in autonomous operations place greater emphasis on task completion rather than solely on data transmission. Such differences require us to evaluate the performance of each stage in the system and consider the integrated optimization. Motivated by this, we model the system in a sensing-communication-computing-control (SC3) closed-loop manner and analyze it from an entropy-based perspective, based on which a task-oriented system design method is developed. Furthermore, to manage the complexity of the closed-loop system, we decompose it into fine-grained functional structures and investigate the key challenges associated with collaborative sensing, collaborative computing, and collaborative control. A case study is presented to compare the proposed task-oriented scheme with conventional communication-oriented schemes, showing that the proposed method performs better in terms of task controlling. Finally, we discuss several open research challenges that need to be addressed for practical implementation."}

We propose a hybrid architecture that decomposes the scattering operator into two separate contributions: a smooth background propagation and a high-contrast scattering correction. The smooth component is learned with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which produces globally coupled feature tokens encoding background wave propagation; these tokens are then passed to a vision transformer, where attention is used to model the high-contrast scattering correction dominated by strong, spatial interactions. Evaluated on high-frequency Helmholtz problems with strong contrasts, the hybrid model achieves substantially improved phase and amplitude accuracy compared to standalone FNOs or transformers, with favorable accuracy-parameter scaling."}

In real-world driving environments, radar signals often undergo multipath propagation due to reflections from surfaces such as guardrails. These indirect paths can produce ghost targets - false detections that appear at incorrect locations - posing challenges to autonomous navigation. A recent method, the Multi-Path Iterative Adaptive Approach (MP-IAA), addresses this by jointly estimating the DOA/DOD angle grid, identifying mismatches as indicators of ghost targets. However, its effectiveness declines in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. To enhance robustness, we introduce a physics-inspired regularizer that captures structural patterns inherent to multipath propagation. This regularizer is incorporated into the estimation cost, forming a new loss function that guides our proposed algorithm, TIGRE (Target-Induced angle-Grid Regularized Estimation). TIGRE iteratively minimizes this regularized loss and we show that our proposed regularizer asymptotically enforces L0 sparsity on the DOA/DOD grid. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method substantially enhances the quality of angle-grid estimation across various multipath scenarios, particularly in low SNR environments, providing a more reliable basis for subsequent ghost target identification."}

However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as \"state drift\" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation."}

Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach."}

To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work."}

This article examines how practical considerations regarding the phase tuning of unit cells impact the RIS performance. Specifically, we examine the radar cross-section (RCS) obtained from two RIS configurations: In the first, each atom of the RIS is tuned based on a theoretical analog phase shift to realize idealized one-beam patterns at the desired angles. In the second configuration, each atom of the RIS is tuned based on a low-complexity, one-bit quantized element phase shift, which results in dual symmetric beams.

Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot."}

The resulting design couples the multi-antenna base-station (BS) beamformer with combinatorial FRIS port selection and discrete phase assignment, leading to a highly nonconvex mixed discrete optimization. To address this challenge, we develop an alternating-optimization (AO) framework that alternates between a closed-form maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) update at the BS and an {optimal} FRIS-configuration update. The key step of the proposed FRIS configuration is a Minkowski-geometry reformulation of the FRIS codebook superposition: by convexifying the feasible reflected-sum set and exploiting support-function identities, we convert the FRIS subproblem into a one-dimensional maximization over a directional parameter. For each direction, the optimal configuration is obtained constructively via per-port directional scoring, Top-$M_o$ port selection, and optimal codeword assignment. For the practically important regular $M_p$-gon phase-shifter codebook, we further derive closed-form score expressions and establish a piecewise-smooth structure of the resulting support function, which leads to a finite critical-angle search that provably identifies the global optimum without exhaustive angular sweeping. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms benchmarks, achieves near-optimal beamforming gains in exhaustive-search validations, accurately identifies the optimal direction via support-function maximization, and converges rapidly within a few AO iterations."}

In this article, a unified analytical framework is proposed to characterize the maintainability of PASS. Within this framework, random waveguide failures and repairs are modeled by treating the waveguide lifetime and repair time as exponentially distributed random variables, which are characterized by the failure rate and the repair rate, respectively. The operational state of the waveguide is described by a two-state continuous-time Markov chain, for which the transition probabilities and steady-state probabilities of the waveguide being working or failed are analyzed. By incorporating the randomness of the waveguide operational state into the transmission rate, system maintainability is characterized using the probability of non-zero rate (PNR) and outage probability (OP). The proposed framework is applied to both a conventional PASS employing a single long waveguide and a segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) composed of multiple short waveguide segments under two operational protocols: segment switching (SS) and segment aggregation (SA). Closed-form expressions for the PNR and OP are derived for both architectures, and the corresponding scaling laws are analyzed with respect to the service-region size and the number of segments. It is proven that both SS-based and SA-based SWAN achieve higher PNR and lower OP than conventional PASS, which confirms the maintainability advantage of segmentation. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the maintainability gain of SWAN over conventional PASS increases with the number of segments, and ii) SA provides stronger maintainability than SS."}

Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers. In simulated ProcTHOR homes and in the real world, our approach outperforms non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal prep."}

At the core of the receiver model is a shared-weight DetectorNN that operates independently on each spatial stream or layer, enabling near-linear complexity scaling with respect to multiplexing order. To ensure better explainability and generalization, EqDeepRx retains conventional channel estimation and augments it with a lightweight DenoiseNN that learns frequency-domain smoothing. To reduce the dimensionality of the DetectorNN inputs, the receiver utilizes two linear equalizers in parallel: a linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) equalizer with interference-plus-noise covariance estimation and a regularized zero-forcing (RZF) equalizer. The parallel equalized streams are jointly consumed by the DetectorNN, after which a compact DemapperNN produces bit log-likelihood ratios for channel decoding. 5G/6G-compliant end-to-end simulations across multiple channel scenarios, pilot patterns, and inter-cell interference conditions show improved error rate and spectral efficiency over a conventional baseline, while maintaining low-complexity inference and support for different MIMO configurations without retraining."}

We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference.

Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/."}

We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks trained with task-specific perturbations of geometry, materials, and Tx positions can implicitly compensate for prediction errors caused by inaccurate environment inputs. When tested with noisy inputs on synthetic indoor scenarios, models trained with perturbed environment data reduce error by up to 25\\% compared to models trained on clean data. We verify our approach on real-world measurements, achieving 2.1 dB RMSE with noisy input data and 1.3 dB with complete information, compared to 2.3-3.1 dB for classical methods such as ray-tracing and radial basis function interpolation. Additionally, we compare different ways of encoding environment information at varying levels of detail and we find that, in the considered single-room indoor scenarios, binary occupancy encoding performs at least as well as detailed material property information, simplifying practical deployment."}

However, conventional SIM designs rely on rigid planar layers with fixed interlayer spacing, which constrain the propagation geometry and can lead to performance saturation as the number of layers increases. This paper investigates the potential of introducing structural flexibility into SIM-enabled communication systems. Specifically, we consider two flexible SIM architectures: distance-adaptive SIM (DSIM), where interlayer distances are optimized, and stacked flexible intelligent metasurface (SFIM), where each metasurface layer is fully morphable. We jointly design the meta-atom positions and responses together with the transmit beamformer to maximize the system sum rate under per-user rate, quantization, morphing, and interlayer distance constraints. An alternating optimization framework combining gradient projection, penalty-based method, and successive convex approximation is developed to address the resulting non-convex problems. Perturbation analysis reveals that the flexibility gains of both DSIM and SFIM scale approximately linearly with the morphing range, with SFIM exhibiting a faster growth rate. Simulation results demonstrate that flexible SIM designs mitigate performance saturation with increasing layers and achieve significant transmit power savings compared to rigid SIMs."}

However, currently employed linear precoding techniques, such as MMSE, significantly limit the achievable spectral efficiency. To meet practical error-rate targets, existing linear methods require an excessively high number of access point antennas relative to the number of supported users, leading to disproportionate increases in power consumption.Efficient non-linear processing frameworks for uplink MIMO transmissions, such as NL-COMM, have been proposed. However, downlink non-linear precoding methods, such as Vector Perturbation (VP), remain impractical for real-world deployment due to their exponentially increasing computational complexity with the number of supported streams. This work presents ViPer NL-COMM, the first practical algorithmic and implementation framework for VP-based precoding. ViPer NL-COMM extends the core principles of NL-COMM to the precoding problem, enabling scalable parallelization and real-time computational performance while maintaining the substantial spectral-efficiency benefits of VP precoding. ViPer NL-COMM consists of a novel mathematical framework and an FPGA prototype capable of supporting large MIMO configurations (up to 16x16), high-order modulation (256-QAM), and wide bandwidths (100 MHz) within practical power and resource budgets. System-level evaluations demonstrate that ViPer NL-COMM achieves target error rates using only half the number of transmit antennas required by linear precoding, yielding net power savings on the order of hundreds of Watts at the RF front end.

As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions.

We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts.

At each FC antenna, there is one fixed-position active antenna and multiple passive couplers that can move within a designated region around the active antenna. Moreover, each FC antenna is equipped with a local processing unit (LPU). All LPUs exchange signals with a central processing unit (CPU) for joint signal processing. We study an FC-aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where an FC array base station (BS) is deployed to enhance the downlink communication between the BS and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate optimization problems to maximize the achievable sum rate of users by jointly optimizing the coupler positions and digital beamforming, subject to movement constraints on the coupler positions and the transmit power constraint. To address the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, the digital beamforming is expressed as a function of the FC position vectors, which are then optimized using the proposed distributed coupler position optimization algorithm. Considering a structured time domain pattern of pilots and coupler positions, pilot-assisted centralized and distributed channel estimation algorithms are designed under the FC array architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed FC array achieves substantial rate gains over conventional benchmarks in multiuser systems without moving active antennas, and approaches the performance of fully active arrays while significantly reducing hardware cost and power consumption. Moreover, the proposed channel estimation algorithms outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of both pilot overhead and channel reconstruction accuracy."}

However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy."}

However, they face two critical challenges: a difficulty in achieving high frequency resolution over a wideband analysis bandwidth, and a reliance on large-bandwidth-and-high-sampling-rate oscilloscopes to capture the resulting ultra-narrow pulses. We introduce a dynamic dispersion accumulation technique to overcome these limitations. By circulating the optical signal in fiber loops containing a dispersion-compensating fiber, we achieve a high accumulated dispersion of -215700 ps/nm. This high dispersion relaxes the required chirp rate of the chirped optical signal, enabling two distinct advantages: When the analysis bandwidth is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a longer temporal period, yielding a record-high frequency resolution of 27.9 MHz; When the temporal period is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a smaller bandwidth, generating a wider pulse and thus relaxing pulse sampling requirements at the expense of analysis bandwidth. This sacrifice in analysis bandwidth can be compensated by a duty-cycle-enabling technique, which holds the potential to extend the analysis bandwidth beyond 100 GHz. This work breaks the performance and hardware limitations in dispersion-based systems, paving the way for high frequency resolution, wideband microwave measurement systems that are both real-time and cost-effective."}

The process is based on the solidification of photopolymer that occurs when a sufficient threshold dose of light-energy is absorbed. In order to create complex shapes, an illumination plan must be designed to force solidification in some desired areas while leaving other regions liquid. Determining an illumination plan can be considered as an optimisation problem where a variety of objective functionals (penalties) can be used. This work considers a selection of penalty functions and their impact on selected printing metrics; linking the shape of penalty functions to ranges of light-energy dose levels in in-part regions that should be printed and out-of-part regions that should remain liquid. Further, the threshold parameters that are typically used to demarcate minimum light-energy for in-part regions and maximum light-energy for out-of-part regions are investigated systematically as design parameters on both existing and new methods. This enables the characterisation of their effects on some selected printing metrics as well as informed selection for default values.

Gossiping enables local information exchange in a decentralized manner without relying solely on the transmitter's direct communication, which we assume incurs a transmission cost. On the other hand, gossiping may be communicating stale information, necessitating the transmitter's intervention. With communication links having specific success probabilities, we formulate an average-cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) to jointly minimize the sum AoI and transmission cost for such a system in a time-slotted setting. We employ the Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm to evaluate the optimal policy for the transmitter and then prove several structural properties showing that it has an age-difference threshold structure with minimum age activation in the case where gossiping is relatively more reliable. Specifically, direct transmission is optimal only if the minimum AoI of the receivers is large enough and their age difference is below a certain threshold. Otherwise, the transmitter idles to effectively take advantage of gossiping and reduce direct transmission costs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the significance of our optimal policy compared to multiple baselines. Our result is a first step towards characterizing optimal freshness and transmission cost trade-offs in gossiping networks."}

Their discriminative objective creates a \"blind spot\" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act."}

By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency.

Compact track summaries are exchanged and fused conservatively via covariance intersection, ensuring consistency under unknown correlations. An information-driven assignment module allocates targets and selects UAV hover viewpoints by trading expected uncertainty reduction against travel effort and safety separation.

Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation."}

Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks.

One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse.

In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers.

To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling.

In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning.

We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce \"boot-time compute\" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks.

Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning.

However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.\n  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM).

To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture."}

Unlike existing methods that couple tracking and mapping with a unified scene, incurring computational costs, or loosely integrate them with well-structured tracking frameworks, introducing redundancies, our method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). Specifically, our approach formulates joint optimization within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, enabling the simultaneous refinement of VO-derived semi-dense depth estimates and the GS representation without additional computational overhead. Moreover, we present Gaussian Splat Initialization, which utilizes image information, keyframe poses, and pixel associations from VO to produce close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, thereby eliminating the need for heuristic methods. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it not only operates in real time but also achieves state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity of the reconstructed scene and tracking accuracy."}

However, when exploration is encouraged only at the individual agent level, it often leads to redundancy, as agents act without awareness of how their teammates are exploring. In this work, we introduce Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood (CCL) rewards, which score each agent's exploration by isolating its unique contribution to team exploration. Unlike prior methods that reward agents solely for the novelty of their individual observations, CCL emphasizes observations that are informative with respect to the joint exploration of the team. Experiments in continuous multiagent domains show that CCL rewards accelerate learning for domains with sparse team rewards, where most joint actions yield zero rewards, and are particularly effective in tasks that require tight coordination among agents."}

However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks."}

Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition. Our results highlight the potential of generative models in enhancing scene-level and place-aware synthesis, providing a valuable approach for improving place recognition in autonomous driving"}

We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning.

Over the past two decades, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has enabled real-time monitoring of hundreds of thousands of vessels, generating huge amounts of data daily. One major challenge in using AIS data is the presence of large gaps in vessel trajectories, often caused by coverage limitations or intentional transmission interruptions. These gaps can significantly degrade data quality, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete analysis. State-of-the-art imputation approaches have mainly been devised to tackle gaps in vehicle trajectories, even when the underlying road network is not considered. But the motion patterns of sailing vessels differ substantially, e.g., smooth turns, maneuvering near ports, or navigating in adverse weather conditions. In this application paper, we propose HABIT, a lightweight, configurable H3 Aggregation-Based Imputation framework for vessel Trajectories. This data-driven framework provides a valuable means to impute missing trajectory segments by extracting, analyzing, and indexing motion patterns from historical AIS data. Our empirical study over AIS data across various timeframes, densities, and vessel types reveals that HABIT produces maritime trajectory imputations performing comparably to baseline methods in terms of accuracy, while performing better in terms of latency while accounting for vessel characteristics and their motion patterns."}

While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace."}
