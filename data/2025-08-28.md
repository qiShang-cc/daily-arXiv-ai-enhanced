### [1] [Depression diagnosis from patient interviews using multimodal machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19390)
*Jana Weber,Marcel Weber,Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合语音、语言和临床特征的机器学习方法，用于提高抑郁症的诊断准确性，并通过多模态融合模型表现出优越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是全球重大公共卫生问题，需要早期准确诊断。临床识别困难，患者访谈中的语音、语言和行为特征可能提供客观诊断标记。

Method: 开发了一种整合语音模式、语言特征和临床信息的诊断方法，通过多模态融合模型训练并评估其临床效用。

Result: 多模态模型的诊断准确性显著优于单模态模型（AUROC 0.88，F1-score 0.75），表现出良好的校准和临床效益。

Conclusion: 多模态机器学习分析可作为精神病学评估的辅助工具，结合多种特征增强抑郁症的早期检测和决策支持。

Abstract: Background: Depression is a major public health concern, affecting an
estimated five percent of the global population. Early and accurate diagnosis
is essential to initiate effective treatment, yet recognition remains
challenging in many clinical contexts. Speech, language, and behavioral cues
collected during patient interviews may provide objective markers that support
clinical assessment.
  Methods: We developed a diagnostic approach that integrates features derived
from patient interviews, including speech patterns, linguistic characteristics,
and structured clinical information. Separate models were trained for each
modality and subsequently combined through multimodal fusion to reflect the
complexity of real-world psychiatric assessment. Model validity was assessed
with established performance metrics, and further evaluated using calibration
and decision-analytic approaches to estimate potential clinical utility.
  Results: The multimodal model achieved superior diagnostic accuracy compared
to single-modality models, with an AUROC of 0.88 and an F1-score of 0.75.
Importantly, the fused model demonstrated good calibration and offered higher
net clinical benefit compared to baseline strategies, highlighting its
potential to assist clinicians in identifying patients with depression more
reliably.
  Conclusion: Multimodal analysis of patient interviews using machine learning
may serve as a valuable adjunct to psychiatric evaluation. By combining speech,
language, and clinical features, this approach provides a robust framework that
could enhance early detection of depressive disorders and support
evidence-based decision-making in mental healthcare.

### [2] [1-Bit Unlimited Sampling Beyond Fourier Domain: Low-Resolution Sampling of Quantization Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19408)
*Vaclav Pavlicek,Ayush Bhandari*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型1位采样架构，结合了1位Sigma-Delta量化与无限传感框架，通过广义噪声整形和改进的变换域恢复方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ADC的性能受限于采样率和比特预算，尤其是1-Bit Sigma-Delta量化（SDQ）存在过载问题。作者旨在通过结合SDQ与无限传感框架（USF），提出一种更高效的1位采样架构，以克服现有技术的局限性。

Method: 1. 将噪声整形概念推广到傅里叶域之外，允许在变换域中进行信号处理；2. 基于此推广，开发了一种新的1-Bit USF变换域恢复方法。

Result: 在傅里叶域中，该方法表现出优于现有时域技术的性能，不仅降低了过采样需求，还提高了鲁棒性。数值实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为1位采样系统的广义化奠定了基础，为未来更高效的ADC设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) play a critical role in digital signal
acquisition across various applications, but their performance is inherently
constrained by sampling rates and bit budgets. This bit budget imposes a
trade-off between dynamic range (DR) and digital resolution, with ADC energy
consumption scaling linearly with sampling rate and exponentially with bit
depth. To bypass this, numerous approaches, including oversampling with
low-resolution ADCs, have been explored. A prominent example is 1-Bit ADCs with
Sigma-Delta Quantization (SDQ), a widely used consumer-grade solution. However,
SDQs suffer from overloading or saturation issues, limiting their ability to
handle inputs with arbitrary DR. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF)
addresses this challenge by injecting modulo non-linearity in hardware,
resulting in a new digital sensing technology. In this paper, we introduce a
novel 1-Bit sampling architecture that extends both conventional 1-Bit SDQ and
USF. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We generalize the concept of noise
shaping beyond the Fourier domain, allowing the inclusion of non-bandlimited
signals in the Fourier domain but bandlimited in alternative transform domains.
(2) Building on this generalization, we develop a new transform-domain recovery
method for 1-Bit USF. When applied to the Fourier domain, our method
demonstrates superior performance compared to existing time-domain techniques,
offering reduced oversampling requirements and improved robustness. Extensive
numerical experiments validate our findings, laying the groundwork for a
broader generalization of 1-Bit sampling systems.

TL;DR: 论文研究了卫星通信中载波聚合（CA）的设计与实验验证，特别关注多轨道场景，展示了其在频谱利用和用户需求满足方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星通信社区正探索载波聚合技术，以提高频谱利用率和满足用户流量需求，但缺乏实际实验验证，尤其是多轨道场景。

Method: 研究基于软件定义无线电（SDR）和卫星信道模拟器设计实验平台，包括网关模块和用户终端模块，并进行单轨道和多轨道的CA实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，卫星通信系统中的载波聚合在多轨道场景下表现出色，验证了其技术可行性。

Conclusion: 载波聚合在卫星通信系统中具有显著潜力，有望在未来通过空中测试进一步验证其实际应用。

Abstract: Carrier Aggregation (CA) is a technique used in 5G and previous cellular
generations to temporarily increase the data rate of a specific user during
peak demand periods or to reduce carrier congestion. CA is achieved by
combining two or more carriers and providing a virtual, wider overall bandwidth
to high-demand users of the system. CA was introduced in the 4G/LTE wireless
era and has been proven effective in 5G as well, where it is said to play a
significant role in efficient network capacity management. Given this success,
the satellite communication (SatCom) community has put its attention into CA
and the potential benefits it can bring in terms of better spectrum utilization
and better meeting the user traffic demand. While the theoretical evaluation of
CA for SatCom has already been presented in several works, this article
presents the design and results obtained with an experimentation testbed based
on Software Defined Radio (SDR) and a satellite channel emulator. We first
present the detailed implementation design, which includes a Gateway (GW)
module responsible for PDU-scheduling across the aggregated carriers, and a
User Terminal (UT) module responsible for aggregating the multiple received
streams. The second part of the article presents the experimental evaluation,
including CA over a single Geostationary (GEO) satellite, CA over a single
Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite, and CA combining carriers sent over GEO and
MEO satellites. A key contribution of this work is the explicit consideration
of multi-orbit scenarios in the testbed design and validation. The testing
results show promising benefits of CA over SatCom systems, motivating potential
upcoming testing on over-the-air systems.

### [4] [Fourth-Order Hierarchical Array: A Novel Scheme for Sparse Array Design Based on Fourth-Order Difference Co-Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19522)
*Si Wang,Guoqiang Xiao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出一种结合不同形式的四阶差共数组（FODCA）的新方案，设计具有更高自由度（DOFs）的阵列，并考虑传感器间的互耦效应，构建新型四阶分层阵列（FOHA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于四阶累积量的阵列设计仅采用单一形式的FODCA，限制了自由度的提升且忽略了传感器互耦的影响。

Method: 通过结合不同形式的FODCA构建FOHA，推导耦合泄漏与FOHA关系的解析表达式，并提出两种具体阵列配置。

Result: 所提阵列不仅提供更高的DOFs以实现更多DOA估计，还能有效抑制互耦，且冗余度优于现有FODCA阵列。

Conclusion: 仿真验证FOHA在DOA估计性能上优于其他稀疏线性阵列，具有更高自由度和更强抗互耦能力。

Abstract: Conventional array designs based on circular fourth-order cumulant typically
adopt a single expression form of the fourth-order difference co-array (FODCA),
which limits the achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs) and neglects the impact
of mutual coupling among physical sensors. To address above issues, this paper
proposes a novel scheme to design arrays with increased DOFs by combining
different forms of FODCA while accounting for mutual coupling. A novel
fourth-order hierarchical array (FOHA) based on different forms of FODCA is
constructed using an arbitrary generator set. The analytical expression between
the coupling leakage of the generator and the resulting FOHA is derived. Two
specific FOHA configurations are presented with closed-form sensor placements.
The arrays not only offer increased DOFs for resolving more sources in
direction of-arrival (DOA) estimation but also effectively suppress mutual
coupling. Moreover, the redundancy of FODCA is examined, and it is shown that
arrays based on the proposed scheme achieve lower redundancy compared to
existing arrays based on FODCA. Meanwhile, the necessary and sufficient
conditions for signal reconstruction by FOHA are derived. Compared with
existing arrays based on FODCA, the proposed arrays provide enhanced DOFs and
improved robustness against mutual coupling. Numerical simulations verify that
FOHAs achieve superior DOA estimation performance compared with other sparse
linear arrays.

### [5] [Pinching Antenna System for Integrated Sensing and Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19540)
*Haochen Li,Ruikang Zhong,Jiayi Lei,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多波导夹持天线系统（PASS）的集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统，通过优化数字波束成形和夹持波束成形，实现了感知性能的提升和通信约束的影响降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夹持天线系统（PASS）因其灵活的部署和减少信号传播损耗的优势而受到关注，本文提出其在集成感知与通信（ISAC）中的应用。

Method: 采用交替优化（AO）方法，将问题分解为数字波束成形和夹持波束成形子问题，分别用半定松弛（SDR）和逐次凸逼近（SCA）等方法求解。

Result: 仿真结果表明，提出的PASS辅助ISAC框架性能优于基准方案，且对通信约束的敏感性低于传统MIMO-ISAC。

Conclusion: PASS辅助ISAC系统在性能提升和抗通信约束方面表现优越，未来可通过增加波导和夹持天线数量进一步优化。

Abstract: Recently, the pinching antenna system (PASS) has attracted considerable
attention due to their advantages in flexible deployment and reduction of
signal propagation loss. In this work, a multiple waveguide PASS assisted
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is proposed, where the base
station (BS) is equipped with transmitting pinching antennas (PAs) and
receiving uniform linear array (ULA) antennas. The full-duplex (FD) BS
transmits the communication and sensing signals through the PAs on waveguides
and collects the echo sensing signals with the mounted ULA. Based on this
configuration, a target sensing Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) minimization problem is
formulated under communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, power
budget constraint, and PA deployment constraints. The alternating optimization
(AO) method is employed to address the formulated non-convex optimization
problem. In each iteration, the overall optimization problem is decomposed into
a digital beamforming sub-problem and a pinching beamforming sub-problem. The
sensing covariance matrix and communication beamforming matrix at the BS are
optimized by solving the digital beamforming sub-problem with semidefinite
relaxation (SDR). The PA deployment is updated by solving the pinching
beamforming sub-problem with the successive convex approximation (SCA) method,
penalty method, and element-wise optimization. Simulation results show that the
proposed PASS assisted ISAC framework achieves superior performance over
benchmark schemes, is less affected by stringent communication constraints
compared to conventional MIMO-ISAC, and benefits further from increasing the
number of waveguides and PAs per waveguide.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CSRD框架，用于生成大规模合成射频数据，以支持大型AI模型在无线通信中的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无线通信中AI模型训练所需的大量多样且真实的数据集问题。

Method: 开发了CSRD框架，模拟端到端传输和接收过程，包括多种调制方案、信道模型和天线配置。

Result: 生成了CSRD2025数据集，规模远超现有数据集，具备前所未有的信号多样性和复杂性。

Conclusion: CSRD框架和数据集为AI驱动的频谱感知和管理提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The development of Large AI Models (LAMs) for wireless communications,
particularly for complex tasks like spectrum sensing, is critically dependent
on the availability of vast, diverse, and realistic datasets. Addressing this
need, this paper introduces the ChangShuoRadioData (CSRD) framework, an
open-source, modular simulation platform designed for generating large-scale
synthetic radio frequency (RF) data. CSRD simulates the end-to-end transmission
and reception process, incorporating an extensive range of modulation schemes
(100 types, including analog, digital, OFDM, and OTFS), configurable channel
models featuring both statistical fading and site-specific ray tracing using
OpenStreetMap data, and detailed modeling of realistic RF front-end impairments
for various antenna configurations (SISO/MISO/MIMO). Using this framework, we
characterize CSRD2025, a substantial dataset benchmark comprising over
25,000,000 frames (approx. 200TB), which is approximately 10,000 times larger
than the widely used RML2018 dataset. CSRD2025 offers unprecedented signal
diversity and complexity, specifically engineered to bridge the Sim2Real gap.
Furthermore, we provide processing pipelines to convert IQ data into
spectrograms annotated in COCO format, facilitating object detection approaches
for time-frequency signal analysis. The dataset specification includes
standardized 8:1:1 training, validation, and test splits (via frame indices) to
ensure reproducible research. The CSRD framework is released at
https://github.com/Singingkettle/ChangShuoRadioData to accelerate the
advancement of AI-driven spectrum sensing and management.

### [7] [Energy-Efficient Learning-Based Beamforming for ISAC-Enabled V2X Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19566)
*Chen Shang,Jiadong Yu,Dinh Thai Hoang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的节能波束成形方案，用于支持车辆到一切（V2X）网络的集成感知与通信（ISAC），通过结合脉冲神经网络（SNN）提高能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V2X网络动态多变，传统波束成形方案需要频繁传输导频信号和获取大量信道状态信息，导致高能耗。

Method: 将V2X环境建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出结合深度强化学习（DRL）和脉冲神经网络（SNN）的联合优化算法，用于波束成形和功率分配。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法显著节能且通信性能优异，适用于未来绿色可持续的V2X系统。

Conclusion: 提出的方案在动态环境中有效平衡了通信与感知需求，同时大幅降低能耗。

Abstract: This work proposes an energy-efficient, learning-based beamforming scheme for
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled V2X networks. Specifically,
we first model the dynamic and uncertain nature of V2X environments as a Markov
Decision Process. This formulation allows the roadside unit to generate
beamforming decisions based solely on current sensing information, thereby
eliminating the need for frequent pilot transmissions and extensive channel
state information acquisition. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithm to jointly optimize beamforming and power allocation, ensuring
both communication throughput and sensing accuracy in highly dynamic scenario.
To address the high energy demands of conventional learning-based schemes, we
embed spiking neural networks (SNNs) into the DRL framework. Leveraging their
event-driven and sparsely activated architecture, SNNs significantly enhance
energy efficiency while maintaining robust performance. Simulation results
confirm that the proposed method achieves substantial energy savings and
superior communication performance, demonstrating its potential to support
green and sustainable connectivity in future V2X systems.

### [8] [Code-Weight Sphere Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19631)
*Yubeen Jo,Geon Choi,Yongjune Kim,Namyoon Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的两阶段近最大似然解码框架，适用于任何线性块码，通过低复杂度初始解码和权重球译码（WSD）实现高效可靠的通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足超可靠低延迟通信（URLLC）在有限块长度下的高性能需求，需要高效且可靠的解码方法。

Method: 采用两阶段解码框架：先用低复杂度初步解码，若失败则触发基于预计算低权重码字的权重球译码（WSD）进行精细优化。

Result: 模拟结果显示，该解码器在高信噪比下具有接近最大似然性能，且计算开销低，特别适用于低码率代码。

Conclusion: 两阶段解码器在解码可靠性和复杂度之间取得了良好平衡，是下一代URLLC系统的潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand high-performance
error-correcting codes and decoders in the finite blocklength regime. This
letter introduces a novel two-stage near-maximum likelihood (near-ML) decoding
framework applicable to any linear block code. Our approach first employs a
low-complexity initial decoder. If this initial stage fails a cyclic redundancy
check, it triggers a second stage: the proposed code-weight sphere decoding
(WSD). WSD iteratively refines the codeword estimate by exploring a localized
sphere of candidates constructed from pre-computed low-weight codewords. This
strategy adaptively minimizes computational overhead at high signal-to-noise
ratios while achieving near-ML performance, especially for low-rate codes.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that our two-stage decoder provides an
excellent trade-off between decoding reliability and complexity, establishing
it as a promising solution for next-generation URLLC systems.

Abstract: Flexible Electronics (FE) offer a promising alternative to rigid
silicon-based hardware for wearable healthcare devices, enabling lightweight,
conformable, and low-cost systems. However, their limited integration density
and large feature sizes impose strict area and power constraints, making
ML-based healthcare systems-integrating analog frontend, feature extraction and
classifier-particularly challenging. Existing FE solutions often neglect
potential system-wide solutions and focus on the classifier, overlooking the
substantial hardware cost of feature extraction and Analog-to-Digital
Converters (ADCs)-both major contributors to area and power consumption. In
this work, we present a holistic mixed-signal feature-to-classifier co-design
framework for flexible smart wearable systems. To the best of our knowledge, we
design the first analog feature extractors in FE, significantly reducing
feature extraction cost. We further propose an hardware-aware NAS-inspired
feature selection strategy within ML training, enabling efficient,
application-specific designs. Our evaluation on healthcare benchmarks shows our
approach delivers highly accurate, ultra-area-efficient flexible systems-ideal
for disposable, low-power wearable monitoring.

Abstract: The use of communication satellites in medium Earth orbit (MEO) is foreseen
to provide quasi-global broadband Internet connectivity in the coming
networking ecosystems. Multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO)
digital signal processing techniques, such as precoding, emerge as appealing
technological enablers in the forward link of multi-beam satellite systems
operating in full frequency reuse (FFR). However, the orbit dynamics of MEO
satellites pose additional challenges that must be carefully evaluated and
addressed. This work presents the design of an in-lab testbed based on
software-defined radio (SDR) platforms and the corresponding adaptations
required for efficient precoding in a MEO scenario. The setup incorporates a
precise orbit model and the radiation pattern of a custom-designed direct
radiating array (DRA). We analyze the main impairments affecting precoding
performance, including Doppler shifts and payload phase noise, and propose a
synchronization loop to mitigate these effects. Preliminary experimental
results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Abstract: Printed electronics offer a promising alternative for applications beyond
silicon-based systems, requiring properties like flexibility, stretchability,

approximate printed neural networks by 17x in area and 59x in power on average,
being the first to enable printed-battery-powered operation with under 5%
accuracy loss while accounting for analog-to-digital interfacing costs.

Abstract: Recently, bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), a biological material produced by
non-pathogenic bacteria that possesses excellent material properties for
various medical applications, has received increased interest as a carrier
system for drug delivery. However, the vast majority of existing studies on
drug release from BNC are feasibility studies with modeling and design aspects
remaining largely unexplored. To narrow this research gap, this paper proposes
a novel model for the drug release from BNC. Specifically, the drug delivery
system considered in this paper consists of a BNC fleece coated with a polymer.
The polymer coating is used as an additional diffusion barrier, enabling the
controlled release of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The proposed
physics-based model reflects the geometry of the BNC and incorporates the
impact of the polymer coating on the drug release. Hence, it can be useful for
designing BNC-based drug delivery systems in the future. The accuracy of the
model is validated with experimental data obtained in wet lab experiments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多阶复合二次型在优化变量元素恒定模约束下的最小化或最大化问题，提出了一种高效的解决方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信号处理中常见的恒定模多阶复合二次规划（CMCQP）问题，该问题通常非凸且难以解决。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the generalized problem that minimizes or maximizes a
multi-order complex quadratic form with constant-modulus constraints on all
elements of its optimization variable. Such a mathematical problem is commonly
encountered in various applications of signal processing. We term it as the
constant-modulus multi-order complex quadratic programming (CMCQP) in this
paper. In general, the CMCQP is non-convex and difficult to solve. Its
objective function typically relates to metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio,
Cram\'er-Rao bound, integrated sidelobe level, etc., and constraints normally
correspond to requirements on similarity to desired aspects,
peak-to-average-power ratio, or constant-modulus property in practical
scenarios. In order to find efficient solutions to the CMCQP, we first
reformulate it into an unconstrained optimization problem with respect to phase
values of the studied variable only. Then, we devise a steepest descent/ascent
method with fast determinations on its optimal step sizes. Specifically, we
convert the step-size searching problem into a polynomial form that leads to
closed-form solutions of high accuracy, wherein the third-order Taylor
expansion of the search function is conducted. Our major contributions also lie
in investigating the effect of the order and specific form of matrices embedded
in the CMCQP, for which two representative cases are identified. Examples of
related applications associated with the two cases are also provided for
completeness. The proposed methods are summarized into algorithms, whose
convergence speeds are verified to be fast by comprehensive simulations and
comparisons to existing methods. The accuracy of our proposed fast step-size
determination is also evaluated.

equalizer filters, the bias current and the modulation radio-frequency (RF)
power applied to the laser. The performance of the end-to-end optimization
scheme is tested on the experimental setup and compared to 4 different
benchmark schemes based on linear and nonlinear receiver-side equalization. The
results show that the proposed end-to-end scheme is able to deliver better
performance throughout the studied symbol rates and transmission distances
while employing lower modulation RF power, fewer filter taps and utilizing a
smaller signal bandwidth.

Motivation: 设计一种能在分布式环境中同时认证多用户的PLA方案，尤其是在面临冒充攻击时仍能保持认证过程的可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种基于标签的PLA CF-mMIMO系统，通过上行训练阶段估计信道并生成共享密钥，随后通过假设检验问题推导检测概率的闭式表达式。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法在多用户系统中仍能保持高检测概率。

Conclusion: 该方案为分布式多用户环境中的物理层认证提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we exploit the cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) architecture to design a physical-layer
authentication (PLA) framework that can simultaneously authenticate multiple
distributed users across the coverage area. Our proposed scheme remains
effective even in the presence of active adversaries attempting impersonation
attacks to disrupt the authentication process. Specifically, we introduce a
tag-based PLA CFmMIMO system, wherein the access points (APs) first estimate
their channels with the legitimate users during an uplink training phase.
Subsequently, a unique secret key is generated and securely shared between each
user and the APs. We then formulate a hypothesis testing problem and derive a
closed-form expression for the probability of detection for each user in the
network. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
demonstrating that it maintains a high detection probability even as the number
of users in the system increases.

Conclusion: PARCC框架为机器人理解人类物体排列规则提供了有效工具，演示学习方法更具优势。

Abstract: As robots' manipulation capabilities improve for pick-and-place tasks (e.g.,
object packing, sorting, and kitting), methods focused on understanding
human-acceptable object configurations remain limited expressively with regard
to capturing spatial relationships important to humans. To advance robotic
understanding of human rules for object arrangement, we introduce
positionally-augmented RCC (PARCC), a formal logic framework based on region
connection calculus (RCC) for describing the relative position of objects in
space. Additionally, we introduce an inference algorithm for learning PARCC
specifications via demonstrations. Finally, we present the results from a human
study, which demonstrate our framework's ability to capture a human's intended
specification and the benefits of learning from demonstration approaches over
human-provided specifications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlipWalker是一种新型欠驱动机器人行走系统，受Jacob's Ladder玩具启发，能够在轮式机器人难以应对的复杂地形中移动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一种能够在复杂地形中高效移动的机器人，解决轮式机器人在此类环境中的局限性。

Method: 采用两段式结构，通过柔性电缆连接，利用电机驱动的腿推动地面或对面段，实现翻转运动。建立了基于物理的欠驱动翻转动力学模型。

Result: 原型重量为0.78公斤，最大翻转速度为每秒0.2个身体长度，在人工草坪、河岩和雪地等不规则地形中表现出色。

Conclusion: FlipWalker的翻转策略为复杂地形中的机器人移动提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces FlipWalker, a novel underactuated robot locomotion
system inspired by Jacob's Ladder illusion toy, designed to traverse
challenging terrains where wheeled robots often struggle. Like the Jacob's
Ladder toy, FlipWalker features two interconnected segments joined by flexible
cables, enabling it to pivot and flip around singularities in a manner
reminiscent of the toy's cascading motion. Actuation is provided by
motor-driven legs within each segment that push off either the ground or the
opposing segment, depending on the robot's current configuration. A
physics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to
elucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle
clearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a
maximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second. Experimental trials on
artificial grass, river rocks, and snow demonstrate that FlipWalker's flipping
strategy, which relies on ground reaction forces applied normal to the surface,
offers a promising alternative to traditional locomotion for navigating
irregular outdoor terrain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过自监督任务学习视觉-文本关联的方法，用于语言引导的机器人操作任务，并引入了一个新数据集来评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的两步方法限制了模型对视觉观察和文本指令关系的捕捉，导致操作任务精度降低，因此需要一种更高效的学习方法。

Method: 通过自监督的掩码目标图像重建任务学习视觉-文本关联，无需机器人动作监督，然后用少量演示微调模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在五个基准测试（模拟和真实机器人验证）中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效学习视觉-动作表示，并在多样化对象操作任务中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual-textual understanding is essential for language-guided robot
manipulation. Recent works leverage pre-trained vision-language models to
measure the similarity between encoded visual observations and textual
instructions, and then train a model to map this similarity to robot actions.
However, this two-step approach limits the model to capture the relationship
between visual observations and textual instructions, leading to reduced
precision in manipulation tasks. We propose to learn visual-textual
associations through a self-supervised pretext task: reconstructing a masked
goal image conditioned on an input image and textual instructions. This
formulation allows the model to learn visual-action representations without
robot action supervision. The learned representations can then be fine-tuned
for manipulation tasks with only a few demonstrations. We also introduce the
\textit{Omni-Object Pick-and-Place} dataset, which consists of annotated robot
tabletop manipulation episodes, including 180 object classes and 3,200
instances with corresponding textual instructions. This dataset enables the
model to acquire diverse object priors and allows for a more comprehensive
evaluation of its generalisation capability across object instances.
Experimental results on the five benchmarks, including both simulated and
real-robot validations, demonstrate that our method outperforms prior art.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究为美国自动驾驶系统（ADS）提供了城市区域的高速公路碰撞率基准，首次扩展了仅针对普通街道的基准，揭示了地理差异对碰撞率的显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展现有基准以涵盖高速公路碰撞风险，为未来ADS安全性能评估提供更全面的基准数据。

Method: 使用公开的警方报告碰撞数据和车辆行驶里程（VMT）数据，通过隔离载客车辆、道路类型分类和碰撞类型分析生成基准。

Result: 发现高速公路碰撞率存在显著地理差异（如亚特兰大比凤凰城高3.5倍），且不同严重程度的碰撞类型分布不同。高严重性碰撞中单车事故和弱势道路使用者比例更高。

Conclusion: 强调了地理位置特定基准的重要性，并为未来ADS评估提供了首套高速公路基准框架，帮助开发者量化与人类驾驶的显著差异。

Abstract: This paper presents crash rate benchmarks for evaluating US-based Automated
Driving Systems (ADS) for multiple urban areas. The purpose of this study was
to extend prior benchmarks focused only on surface streets to additionally
capture freeway crash risk for future ADS safety performance assessments. Using
publicly available police-reported crash and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data,
the methodology details the isolation of in-transport passenger vehicles, road
type classification, and crash typology. Key findings revealed that freeway
crash rates exhibit large geographic dependence variations with
any-injury-reported crash rates being nearly 3.5 times higher in Atlanta (2.4
IPMM; the highest) when compared to Phoenix (0.7 IPMM; the lowest). The results
show the critical need for location-specific benchmarks to avoid biased safety
evaluations and provide insights into the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) required
to achieve statistical significance for various safety impact levels. The
distribution of crash types depended on the outcome severity level. Higher
severity outcomes (e.g., fatal crashes) had a larger proportion of
single-vehicle, vulnerable road users (VRU), and opposite-direction collisions
compared to lower severity (police-reported) crashes. Given heterogeneity in
crash types by severity, performance in low-severity scenarios may not be
predictive of high-severity outcomes. These benchmarks are additionally used to
quantify at the required mileage to show statistically significant deviations
from human performance. This is the first paper to generate freeway-specific
benchmarks for ADS evaluation and provides a foundational framework for future
ADS benchmarking by evaluators and developers.

Method: 基于能力时序逻辑（CaTL）的框架，动态平衡探索与任务完成，逐步优化资源分布理解并调整策略。

Result: 模拟案例研究表明，该方法在动态资源受限环境下有效，能高效协调异构团队应对不确定性。

Conclusion: 迭代算法成功解决了资源不确定性问题，提升了异构团队在复杂环境中的任务执行效率。

Abstract: This paper presents an iterative approach for heterogeneous multi-agent route
planning in environments with unknown resource distributions. We focus on a
team of robots with diverse capabilities tasked with executing missions
specified using Capability Temporal Logic (CaTL), a formal framework built on
Signal Temporal Logic to handle spatial, temporal, capability, and resource
constraints. The key challenge arises from the uncertainty in the initial
distribution and quantity of resources in the environment. To address this, we
introduce an iterative algorithm that dynamically balances exploration and task
fulfillment. Robots are guided to explore the environment, identifying resource
locations and quantities while progressively refining their understanding of
the resource landscape. At the same time, they aim to maximally satisfy the
mission objectives based on the current information, adapting their strategies
as new data is uncovered. This approach provides a robust solution for planning
in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient coordination
of heterogeneous teams even under conditions of uncertainty. Our method's
effectiveness and performance are demonstrated through simulated case studies.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了非抓取触觉传感在机器人从密集物体群中安全提取物体中的作用，通过模仿学习训练策略，并分析了力传感的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常生活中常见密集物体群（如家中橱柜或仓库货架），机器人难以安全操作，而人类依靠触觉传感轻松完成。研究旨在探索此类传感对机器人操作的帮助。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练策略，结合多种传感模式（如视觉、本体感知、触觉传感等），并进行力传感的消融实验。

Result: 采用力传感的策略表现更优，减少了过大力失败，提高了成功率和速度。结合触觉和力信息的策略最佳，性能提升80%。

Conclusion: 非抓取触觉传感显著提升机器人在密集物体群中操作的性能。

Abstract: Dense collections of movable objects are common in everyday spaces -- from
cabinets in a home to shelves in a warehouse. Safely retracting objects from
such collections is difficult for robots, yet people do it easily, using
non-prehensile tactile sensing on the sides and backs of their hands and arms.
We investigate the role of such sensing for training robots to gently reach
into constrained clutter and extract objects. The available sensing modalities
are (1) "eye-in-hand" vision, (2) proprioception, (3) non-prehensile triaxial
tactile sensing, (4) contact wrenches estimated from joint torques, and (5) a
measure of successful object acquisition obtained by monitoring the vacuum line
of a suction cup. We use imitation learning to train policies from a set of
demonstrations on randomly generated scenes, then conduct an ablation study of
wrench and tactile information. We evaluate each policy's performance across 40
unseen environment configurations. Policies employing any force sensing show
fewer excessive force failures, an increased overall success rate, and faster
completion times. The best performance is achieved using both tactile and
wrench information, producing an 80% improvement above the baseline without
force information.

Motivation: 现有的3D重建方法在稀疏和遮挡视图的田间条件下表现不佳，影响数字孪生应用的准确性和实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架（DATR），第一阶段通过传感器和基础模型生成树掩码；第二阶段结合扩散模型和大型重建模型进行单图像到3D重建；使用Real2Sim数据生成器合成训练数据。

Result: DATR在真实和合成数据集上均优于现有方法，处理速度提升360倍，且域特征估计与工业级激光扫描仪相当。

Conclusion: DATR框架展示了可扩展农业数字孪生系统的强大潜力，高效且准确。

Abstract: Digital twin applications offered transformative potential by enabling
real-time monitoring and robotic simulation through accurate virtual replicas
of physical assets. The key to these systems is 3D reconstruction with high
geometrical fidelity. However, existing methods struggled under field
conditions, especially with sparse and occluded views. This study developed a
two-stage framework (DATR) for the reconstruction of apple trees from sparse
views. The first stage leverages onboard sensors and foundation models to
semi-automatically generate tree masks from complex field images. Tree masks
are used to filter out background information in multi-modal data for the
single-image-to-3D reconstruction at the second stage. This stage consists of a
diffusion model and a large reconstruction model for respective multi view and
implicit neural field generation. The training of the diffusion model and LRM
was achieved by using realistic synthetic apple trees generated by a Real2Sim
data generator. The framework was evaluated on both field and synthetic
datasets. The field dataset includes six apple trees with field-measured ground
truth, while the synthetic dataset featured structurally diverse trees.
Evaluation results showed that our DATR framework outperformed existing 3D
reconstruction methods across both datasets and achieved domain-trait
estimation comparable to industrial-grade stationary laser scanners while
improving the throughput by $\sim$360 times, demonstrating strong potential for
scalable agricultural digital twin systems.

Motivation: 传统微观模型计算成本高，宏观模型则过于简化或计算复杂，需一种平衡准确性与效率的方法。

Result: 推理时间减少3.6倍，预测精度提高3.1%，实现高效社交合规导航。

Conclusion: 高效人群建模可帮助机器人在动态环境中低成本导航。

Abstract: Robots operating in human-populated environments must navigate safely and
efficiently while minimizing social disruption. Achieving this requires
estimating crowd movement to avoid congested areas in real-time. Traditional
microscopic models struggle to scale in dense crowds due to high computational
cost, while existing macroscopic crowd prediction models tend to be either
overly simplistic or computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a
lightweight, real-time macroscopic crowd prediction model tailored for human
motion, which balances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Our
approach simplifies both spatial and temporal processing based on the inherent
characteristics of pedestrian flow, enabling robust generalization without the
overhead of complex architectures. We demonstrate a 3.6 times reduction in
inference time, while improving prediction accuracy by 3.1 %. Integrated into a
socially aware planning framework, the model enables efficient and socially
compliant robot navigation in dynamic environments. This work highlights that
efficient human crowd modeling enables robots to navigate dense environments
without costly computations.

Abstract: This paper presents an Impedance Primitive-augmented hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework for efficient robotic manipulation in
sequential contact tasks. We leverage this hierarchical structure to
sequentially execute behavior primitives with variable stiffness control
capabilities for contact tasks. Our proposed approach relies on three key
components: an action space enabling variable stiffness control, an adaptive
stiffness controller for dynamic stiffness adjustments during primitive
execution, and affordance coupling for efficient exploration while encouraging
compliance. Through comprehensive training and evaluation, our framework learns
efficient stiffness control capabilities and demonstrates improvements in
learning efficiency, compositionality in primitive selection, and success rates
compared to the state-of-the-art. The training environments include block
lifting, door opening, object pushing, and surface cleaning. Real world
evaluations further confirm the framework's sim2real capability. This work lays
the foundation for more adaptive and versatile robotic manipulation systems,
with potential applications in more complex contact-based tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多旋翼空中机械臂由于基座的欠驱动特性，只能在较小的滚转和俯仰角度下进行操控。若基座能在任意位姿下悬停，则可显著扩展工作空间并实现更复杂的任务。

Method: 开发了一个几何鲁棒控制器用于浮动基座，并设计了一个基于两步优化的全身运动规划器，联合考虑基座位姿和机械臂关节角度。

Result: 实验表明，OAM能够在任意6D位姿下稳定运行，并在接近90°和180°俯仰角等复杂场景下完成抓取和拉拽任务。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了全向空中机械臂的操控能力，使其能够在复杂环境中稳定运行并完成多样化任务。

Abstract: Aerial manipulators based on conventional multirotors can conduct
manipulation only in small roll and pitch angles due to the underactuatedness
of the multirotor base. If the multirotor base is capable of hovering at
arbitrary orientation, the robot can freely locate itself at any point in
$\mathsf{SE}(3)$, significantly extending its manipulation workspace and
enabling a manipulation task that was originally not viable. In this work, we
present a geometric robust control and whole-body motion planning framework for
an omnidirectional aerial manipulator (OAM). To maximize the strength of OAM,
we first propose a geometric robust controller for a floating base. Since the
motion of the robotic arm and the interaction forces during manipulation affect
the stability of the floating base, the base should be capable of mitigating
these adverse effects while controlling its 6D pose. We then design a two-step
optimization-based whole-body motion planner, jointly considering the pose of
the floating base and the joint angles of the robotic arm to harness the entire
configuration space. The devised two-step approach facilitates real-time
applicability and enhances convergence of the optimization problem with
non-convex and non-Euclidean search space. The proposed approach enables the
base to be stationary at any 6D pose while autonomously carrying out
sophisticated manipulation near obstacles without any collision. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework through experiments in which an OAM
performs grasping and pulling of an object in multiple scenarios, including
near $90^\circ$ and even $180^\circ$ pitch angles.

Conclusion: 结合形态智能和控制策略，为高效空中机器人提供了新思路。

Abstract: Achieving both agile maneuverability and high energy efficiency in aerial
robots, particularly in dynamic wind environments, remains challenging.
Conventional thruster-powered systems offer agility but suffer from high energy
consumption, while fixed-wing designs are efficient but lack hovering and
maneuvering capabilities. We present Floaty, a shape-changing robot that
overcomes these limitations by passively soaring, harnessing wind energy
through intelligent morphological control inspired by birds. Floaty's design is
optimized for passive stability, and its control policy is derived from an
experimentally learned aerodynamic model, enabling precise attitude and
position control without active propulsion. Wind tunnel experiments demonstrate
Floaty's ability to hover, maneuver, and reject disturbances in vertical
airflows up to 10 m/s. Crucially, Floaty achieves this with a specific power
consumption of 10 W/kg, an order of magnitude lower than thruster-powered
systems. This introduces a paradigm for energy-efficient aerial robotics,
leveraging morphological intelligence and control to operate sustainably in
challenging wind conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在共享环境中，人类动态对多机器人任务分配效率有显著影响，而现有方法常忽略此点。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出一种新方法，利用动态地图（MoDs）捕捉人类运动模式，并通过随机成本函数优化任务分配。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比静态地图方法减少26%任务完成时间，比基线方法减少19%。

Conclusion: 考虑人类动态能显著提升MRTA效率，为共享环境中多机器人系统提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are increasingly deployed in applications, such as
intralogistics or autonomous delivery, where multiple robots collaborate to
complete tasks efficiently. One of the key factors enabling their efficient
cooperation is Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA). Algorithms solving this
problem optimize task distribution among robots to minimize the overall
execution time. In shared environments, apart from the relative distance
between the robots and the tasks, the execution time is also significantly
impacted by the delay caused by navigating around moving people. However, most
existing MRTA approaches are dynamics-agnostic, relying on static maps and
neglecting human motion patterns, leading to inefficiencies and delays. In this
paper, we introduce \acrfull{method name}. This method leverages Maps of
Dynamics (MoDs), spatio-temporal queryable models designed to capture
historical human movement patterns, to estimate the impact of humans on the
task execution time during deployment. \acrshort{method name} utilizes a
stochastic cost function that includes MoDs. Experimental results show that
integrating MoDs enhances task allocation performance, resulting in reduced
mission completion times by up to $26\%$ compared to the dynamics-agnostic
method and up to $19\%$ compared to the baseline. This work underscores the
importance of considering human dynamics in MRTA within shared environments and
presents an efficient framework for deploying multi-robot systems in
environments populated by humans.

Abstract: Path planning has long been an important and active research area in
robotics. To address challenges in high-dimensional motion planning, this study
introduces the Force Direction Informed Trees (FDIT*), a sampling-based planner
designed to enhance speed and cost-effectiveness in pathfinding. FDIT* builds
upon the state-of-the-art informed sampling planner, the Effort Informed Trees
(EIT*), by capitalizing on often-overlooked information in invalid vertices. It
incorporates principles of physical force, particularly Coulomb's law. This
approach proposes the elliptical $k$-nearest neighbors search method, enabling
fast convergence navigation and avoiding high solution cost or infeasible paths
by exploring more problem-specific search-worthy areas. It demonstrates
benefits in search efficiency and cost reduction, particularly in confined,
high-dimensional environments. It can be viewed as an extension of nearest
neighbors search techniques. Fusing invalid vertex data with physical dynamics
facilitates force-direction-based search regions, resulting in an improved
convergence rate to the optimum. FDIT* outperforms existing single-query,
sampling-based planners on the tested problems in R^4 to R^16 and has been
demonstrated on a real-world mobile manipulation task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决双向运动中由于反向搜索树限制导致的失败问题，提升路径规划效率。

Method: 使用贪婪策略和GuILD子集的最小Lebesgue测量优化路径，动态调整采样分布保证渐进最优。

Result: 在R^2到R^8维度和实际机器人实验中，G3T*表现优于现有单查询采样规划器。

Conclusion: G3T*通过新颖的路径嫁接和动态优化方法，显著提升了规划速度和路径质量。

Abstract: Bidirectional motion planning often reduces planning time compared to its
unidirectional counterparts. It requires connecting the forward and reverse
search trees to form a continuous path. However, this process could fail and
restart the asymmetric bidirectional search due to the limitations of
lazy-reverse search. To address this challenge, we propose Greedy GuILD
Grafting Trees (G3T*), a novel path planner that grafts invalid edge
connections at both ends to re-establish tree-based connectivity, enabling
rapid path convergence. G3T* employs a greedy approach using the minimum
Lebesgue measure of guided incremental local densification (GuILD) subsets to
optimize paths efficiently. Furthermore, G3T* dynamically adjusts the sampling
distribution between the informed set and GuILD subsets based on historical and
current cost improvements, ensuring asymptotic optimality. These features
enhance the forward search's growth towards the reverse tree, achieving faster
convergence and lower solution costs. Benchmark experiments across dimensions
from R^2 to R^8 and real-world robotic evaluations demonstrate G3T*'s superior
performance compared to existing single-query sampling-based planners. A video

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，通过语义图传播算法估计室内场景中的高风险区域，旨在提升服务机器人在人类环境中的实时风险感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人越来越多地融入日常生活，特别是在家庭环境中，提前识别和应对环境风险对于确保用户安全和信任至关重要。

Method: 采用基于语义图的对象级风险建模方法，风险通过空间邻近性和事故关系从高风险对象传播到低风险对象。

Result: 在人工标注的高风险区域数据集上验证，二分类风险检测准确率达到75%，尤其在涉及尖锐或不稳定物体的场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来基于上下文的安全决策系统奠定了基础，能够在共享人机空间中提升场景理解和主动安全行为。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for estimating accident-prone regions in
everyday indoor scenes, aimed at improving real-time risk awareness in service
robots operating in human-centric environments. As robots become integrated
into daily life, particularly in homes, the ability to anticipate and respond
to environmental hazards is crucial for ensuring user safety, trust, and
effective human-robot interaction. Our approach models object-level risk and
context through a semantic graph-based propagation algorithm. Each object is
represented as a node with an associated risk score, and risk propagates
asymmetrically from high-risk to low-risk objects based on spatial proximity
and accident relationship. This enables the robot to infer potential hazards
even when they are not explicitly visible or labeled. Designed for
interpretability and lightweight onboard deployment, our method is validated on
a dataset with human-annotated risk regions, achieving a binary risk detection
accuracy of 75%. The system demonstrates strong alignment with human
perception, particularly in scenes involving sharp or unstable objects. These
results underline the potential of context-aware risk reasoning to enhance
robotic scene understanding and proactive safety behaviors in shared
human-robot spaces. This framework could serve as a foundation for future
systems that make context-driven safety decisions, provide real-time alerts, or
autonomously assist users in avoiding or mitigating hazards within home
environments.

TL;DR: APT* 是一种自适应批量和椭圆近邻模块的运动规划器，通过动态调整路径搜索过程，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径规划方法通常使用固定批量且忽略障碍物信息，导致非问题特异性。APT* 通过自适应调整和改进近邻选择来解决这些问题。

Method: APT* 结合自适应批量和椭圆 $r$-近邻模块，利用库仑定律定义虚拟力，动态优化路径搜索过程。

Result: APT* 在 $ℝ^4$ 到 $ℝ^{16}$ 维度中表现优于其他规划器，并在真实机器人任务中验证。

Conclusion: APT* 通过自适应机制提高了规划效率和收敛速度，适用于高维复杂环境。

Abstract: Optimal path planning aims to determine a sequence of states from a start to
a goal while accounting for planning objectives. Popular methods often
integrate fixed batch sizes and neglect information on obstacles, which is not
problem-specific. This study introduces Adaptively Prolated Trees (APT*), a
novel sampling-based motion planner that extends based on Force Direction
Informed Trees (FDIT*), integrating adaptive batch-sizing and elliptical
$r$-nearest neighbor modules to dynamically modulate the path searching process
based on environmental feedback. APT* adjusts batch sizes based on the
hypervolume of the informed sets and considers vertices as electric charges
that obey Coulomb's law to define virtual forces via neighbor samples, thereby
refining the prolate nearest neighbor selection. These modules employ
non-linear prolate methods to adaptively adjust the electric charges of
vertices for force definition, thereby improving the convergence rate with
lower solution costs. Comparative analyses show that APT* outperforms existing
single-query sampling-based planners in dimensions from $\mathbb{R}^4$ to
$\mathbb{R}^{16}$, and it was further validated through a real-world robot
manipulation task. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at:

comparisons to other methods to validate our design criteria and demonstrate
the advantages of our contribution.

TL;DR: FARM是一种端到端框架，结合帧加速增强和残差混合专家系统，显著提高了高动态人形运动的控制精度，并创建了首个开放基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人形控制器在温和的日常动作上表现良好，但在高动态动作上容易失败，限制了实际应用。FARM旨在弥补这一差距。

Method: FARM包含帧加速增强、基础控制器和残差混合专家系统。帧加速增强通过扩大帧间差距暴露高速度动作，基础控制器处理低动态动作，残差MoE分配额外网络能力处理高动态动作。

Result: 在HDHM数据集上，FARM将跟踪失败率降低了42.8%，全局平均关节位置误差降低了14.6%，同时在低动态动作上保持高精度。

Conclusion: FARM为高动态人形控制设定了新的基准，并提供了首个公开数据集。

Abstract: Unified physics-based humanoid controllers are pivotal for robotics and
character animation, yet models that excel on gentle, everyday motions still
stumble on explosive actions, hampering real-world deployment. We bridge this
gap with FARM (Frame-Accelerated Augmentation and Residual Mixture-of-Experts),
an end-to-end framework composed of frame-accelerated augmentation, a robust
base controller, and a residual mixture-of-experts (MoE). Frame-accelerated
augmentation exposes the model to high-velocity pose changes by widening
inter-frame gaps. The base controller reliably tracks everyday low-dynamic
motions, while the residual MoE adaptively allocates additional network
capacity to handle challenging high-dynamic actions, significantly enhancing
tracking accuracy. In the absence of a public benchmark, we curate the
High-Dynamic Humanoid Motion (HDHM) dataset, comprising 3593 physically
plausible clips. On HDHM, FARM reduces the tracking failure rate by 42.8\% and
lowers global mean per-joint position error by 14.6\% relative to the baseline,
while preserving near-perfect accuracy on low-dynamic motions. These results
establish FARM as a new baseline for high-dynamic humanoid control and
introduce the first open benchmark dedicated to this challenge. The code and
dataset will be released at https://github.com/Colin-Jing/FARM.

Conclusion: 模块化USD框架结合分解与对称性，能有效提升技能的安全性、多样性和下游任务适用性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Skill Discovery (USD) allows agents to autonomously learn
diverse behaviors without task-specific rewards. While recent USD methods have
shown promise, their application to real-world robotics remains underexplored.
In this paper, we propose a modular USD framework to address the challenges in
the safety, interpretability, and deployability of the learned skills. Our
approach employs user-defined factorization of the state space to learn
disentangled skill representations. It assigns different skill discovery
algorithms to each factor based on the desired intrinsic reward function. To
encourage structured morphology-aware skills, we introduce symmetry-based
inductive biases tailored to individual factors. We also incorporate a style
factor and regularization penalties to promote safe and robust behaviors. We
evaluate our framework in simulation using a quadrupedal robot and demonstrate
zero-shot transfer of the learned skills to real hardware. Our results show
that factorization and symmetry lead to the discovery of structured
human-interpretable behaviors, while the style factor and penalties enhance
safety and diversity. Additionally, we show that the learned skills can be used
for downstream tasks and perform on par with oracle policies trained with
hand-crafted rewards.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型主要适用于短时程任务，而在长时程、多步骤的机器人操作中效果有限，原因是技能链和子任务依赖关系的挑战。

Method: 采用了相位感知输入掩蔽策略，将子任务划分为移动和交互相位，专注于相位相关的感官线索，同时提出了L-CALVIN基准进行系统性评估。

Result: 在仿真和现实任务中，Long-VLA显著优于现有方法，为长时程机器人控制设定了新基准。

Conclusion: Long-VLA通过创新的设计解决了长时程任务的挑战，为未来的机器人控制提供了可扩展和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a cornerstone in robotic
policy learning, leveraging large-scale multimodal data for robust and scalable
control. However, existing VLA frameworks primarily address short-horizon
tasks, and their effectiveness on long-horizon, multi-step robotic manipulation
remains limited due to challenges in skill chaining and subtask dependencies.
In this work, we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model
specifically designed for long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a
novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask
into moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on
phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified
strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our
architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA
models. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically evaluate
long-horizon manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulated and
real-world tasks demonstrate that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic
control.

Motivation: 通过结合注视和语音交互，实现更直观、高效的远程机器人控制。

Method: 使用眼镜追踪操作者注视，结合VLM处理语音指令，生成相应的刚度矩阵。

Result: 实验验证了界面在提示配置和任务功能上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该界面为远程机器人控制提供了一种新的交互方式。

Abstract: The paper presents a visio-verbal teleimpedance interface for commanding 3D
stiffness ellipsoids to the remote robot with a combination of the operator's
gaze and verbal interaction. The gaze is detected by an eye-tracker, allowing
the system to understand the context in terms of what the operator is currently
looking at in the scene. Along with verbal interaction, a Visual Language Model
(VLM) processes this information, enabling the operator to communicate their
intended action or provide corrections. Based on these inputs, the interface
can then generate appropriate stiffness matrices for different physical
interaction actions. To validate the proposed visio-verbal teleimpedance
interface, we conducted a series of experiments on a setup including a Force
Dimension Sigma.7 haptic device to control the motion of the remote Kuka LBR
iiwa robotic arm. The human operator's gaze is tracked by Tobii Pro Glasses 2,
while human verbal commands are processed by a VLM using GPT-4o. The first
experiment explored the optimal prompt configuration for the interface. The
second and third experiments demonstrated different functionalities of the
interface on a slide-in-the-groove task.

Abstract: Leveraging human motion data to impart robots with versatile manipulation
skills has emerged as a promising paradigm in robotic manipulation.
Nevertheless, translating multi-source human hand motions into feasible robot
behaviors remains challenging, particularly for robots equipped with
multi-fingered dexterous hands characterized by complex, high-dimensional
action spaces. Moreover, existing approaches often struggle to produce policies
capable of adapting to diverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we
introduce HERMES, a human-to-robot learning framework for mobile bimanual
dexterous manipulation. First, HERMES formulates a unified reinforcement
learning approach capable of seamlessly transforming heterogeneous human hand
motions from multiple sources into physically plausible robotic behaviors.
Subsequently, to mitigate the sim2real gap, we devise an end-to-end, depth
image-based sim2real transfer method for improved generalization to real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, to enable autonomous operation in varied and
unstructured environments, we augment the navigation foundation model with a
closed-loop Perspective-n-Point (PnP) localization mechanism, ensuring precise
alignment of visual goals and effectively bridging autonomous navigation and
dexterous manipulation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HERMES
consistently exhibits generalizable behaviors across diverse, in-the-wild
scenarios, successfully performing numerous complex mobile bimanual dexterous
manipulation tasks. Project Page:https:/gemcollector.github.io/HERMES/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散MAPF方法可扩展但轨迹质量差，而连续优化方法轨迹质量高但可扩展性差，论文旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 通过离散MAPF分解问题为凸子问题，结合扩散模型和优化技术捕捉机器人时空依赖，并引入轻量约束修复机制。

Result: 在复杂环境中扩展到100个机器人，实现了高效规划和高成功率。

Conclusion: DGD框架在轨迹质量与可扩展性上均优于现有方法，为大规模MRMP问题提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) involves generating collision-free
trajectories for multiple robots operating in a shared continuous workspace.
While discrete multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods are broadly adopted due
to their scalability, their coarse discretization severely limits trajectory
quality. In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer
higher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in
poor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the
limitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that
integrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models.
The resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key
characteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into
tractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines
discrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide
diffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and
(3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure
trajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art
performance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while
achieving planning efficiency and high success rates.

Motivation: 提升航空通信系统的频谱效率，尤其是在多用户多天线环境下。

Method: 利用了基于几何的随机空对地信道模型，比较了三种解码方法（SIC、联合组解码及限制组大小的联合解码）。

Result: 联合组解码（即使是两用户组）能在非正交信道中显著降低中断概率，提升频谱效率。

Conclusion: 联合组解码适合航空通信，能有效支持多用户高容量传输。

Abstract: This paper explores multiuser multiple antenna systems as a means to enhance
the spectral efficiency of aeronautical communications systems. To this end,
the outage regime for a multiuser multiple antenna system is studied within a
realistic geometry-based stochastic air-ground (AG) channel model. In this
application, users (aircraft) transmit air traffic management data to the
ground station at a predefined target rate. Due to the nature of the AG
propagation, we argue that the relevant performance metric in this context is
the information outage probability. We consider the outage probability under
three decoding approaches. The first is based on successive interference
cancellation (SIC). The second extends the first approach by considering joint
group decoding. The third is a version of the second that limits the size of
the jointly decoded user groups in order to lower the decoding complexity. The
results show that joint group decoding, even in groups of only two, can
significantly increase the spectral efficiency in the AG channel by allowing a
large number of aircraft to transmit over a non-orthogonal channel with very
low outage probabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境智能（AmI）需要6G网络具备实时感知和推理能力，而生成式AI通过生成合成数据和语义消息，填补了AmI的关键技术空白。

Method: 综述了生成对抗网络（GANs）、变分自编码器（VAEs）、扩散模型和生成式Transformer等GenAI模型，并将其应用于6G的频谱共享、超可靠低延迟通信等场景。

Result: GenAI结合6G技术（如边缘计算、智能反射面等）能够实现分布式的智能环境，为AmI提供核心支持。

Conclusion: GenAI是6G网络从单纯的高速网络转变为环境智能生态系统的基石，但仍需解决能耗、数据可信度和标准化等挑战。

Abstract: Ambient intelligence (AmI) is a computing paradigm in which physical
environments are embedded with sensing, computation, and communication so they
can perceive people and context, decide appropriate actions, and respond
autonomously. Realizing AmI at global scale requires sixth generation (6G)
wireless networks with capabilities for real time perception, reasoning, and
action aligned with human behavior and mobility patterns. We argue that
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is the creative core of such
environments. Unlike traditional AI, GenAI learns data distributions and can
generate realistic samples, making it well suited to close key AmI gaps,
including generating synthetic sensor and channel data in under observed areas,
translating user intent into compact, semantic messages, predicting future
network conditions for proactive control, and updating digital twins without
compromising privacy.
  This chapter reviews foundational GenAI models, GANs, VAEs, diffusion models,
and generative transformers, and connects them to practical AmI use cases,
including spectrum sharing, ultra reliable low latency communication,
intelligent security, and context aware digital twins. We also examine how 6G
enablers, such as edge and fog computing, IoT device swarms, intelligent
reflecting surfaces (IRS), and non terrestrial networks, can host or accelerate
distributed GenAI. Finally, we outline open challenges in energy efficient on
device training, trustworthy synthetic data, federated generative learning, and
AmI specific standardization. We show that GenAI is not a peripheral addition,
but a foundational element for transforming 6G from a faster network into an
ambient intelligent ecosystem.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TTF的训练免费方法，通过整合历史和当前视觉表征，提升VLA模型在机器人操作任务中的推理质量，显著提高了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型对每帧视觉输入进行独立处理，忽略了机器人操作任务中连续的帧间信息，导致模型易受视觉噪声干扰，且未能充分利用帧间相关性。

Method: TTF结合了灰度像素差异分析和基于注意力的语义相关性评估，通过硬融合策略和关键帧锚定实现选择性时间令牌融合，防止误差累积。

Result: 在LIBERO、SimplerEnv和真实机器人任务中，TTF平均提升了4.0个百分点，交叉环境验证显示4.8%的相对改进，真实任务中提升8.7%。

Conclusion: TTF是一种模型无关方法，其揭示了选择性复用Query矩阵在注意力机制中的潜力，为KQV矩阵复用策略提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at
each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic
manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to
visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive
frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a
training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current
visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs
dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference
analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective
temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to
prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO,
SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0
percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline),
cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and
8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves
model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably,
TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances
rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct
KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while
improving task success rates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型解码器存在顺序生成或连续扩散头部依赖训练的问题，限制了统一、可扩展架构的发展。研究旨在通过离散扩散方法解决这些问题。

Method: 采用离散扩散建模离散动作块，结合交叉熵目标训练，保留了扩散的渐进细化特性，同时支持并行解码和自适应解码顺序。

Conclusion: 离散扩散动作解码器为VLA模型的扩展提供了基础，支持精确动作建模和一致性训练。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to
map images and instructions to robot actions. However, prevailing VLA decoders
either generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order or
attach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone,
demanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified,
scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-transformer
policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and is
trained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The design
retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively
compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an
adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones
and uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement
rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This
unified decoder preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports parallel
decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of
function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO,
71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv
Bridge, improving over both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines.
These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion action decoder supports precise
action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to
