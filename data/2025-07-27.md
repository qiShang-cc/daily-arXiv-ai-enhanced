### [1] [Time and Frequency Synchronization for Multiuser OTFS in Uplink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17966)
*Mohsen Bayat,Sanoopkumar P. S.,Arman Farhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对高移动性场景下上行多用户OTFS系统的时间和频率同步技术，重点在于准确估计和校正时序偏移和载波频率偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高移动性场景中，准确估计时序偏移（TO）和载波频率偏移（CFO）对于定位用户导频和提升信道估计精度至关重要。

Method: 提出了两种TO估计技术和一种CFO估计技术。首先，利用循环前缀导频（PCP）替换传统冲击导频（IMP），并通过ZC序列实现导频分离。其次，提出一种共享导频区域的PCP模式，利用滤波器组分离用户信号。CFO估计则通过降维ML搜索和切比雪夫多项式模型处理时变信道。

Result: 所提出的技术能够有效提升TO和CFO的估计精度，并通过降维方法简化CFO估计的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该研究为高移动性场景下的上行多用户OTFS系统提供了一种高效的时间和频率同步解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose time and frequency synchronization techniques for
uplink multiuser OTFS (MU-OTFS) systems in high-mobility scenarios. This work
focuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and
carrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for
locating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances
channel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an
existing multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot
(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix
(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs
different Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via
correlation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a
correlation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot
structure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is
proposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the
delay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO
estimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'
signals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical
threshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major
peak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest
peak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the
proposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique
reduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into
multiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the
Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to
effectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO
estimates for all the users.

### [2] [Metasurface-based Fluid Antennas: from Electromagnetics to Communications Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17982)
*Pablo Ramírez-Espinosa,Cleofás Segura-Gómez,Ángel Palomares-Caballero,F. Javier López-Martínez,David Morales-Jiménez*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了基于超表面的流体天线系统（FAS）的完整分析模型，通过动态超表面天线（DMA）实现，理论模型与仿真结果吻合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子可重构天线在实际应用中存在分析建模困难的问题，限制了系统设计的理论指导，因此需要一种可行的分析模型。

Method: 利用电路理论将FAS的信号模型改写为包含超表面电磁效应的导纳矩阵，并通过全波仿真验证模型。

Result: 模型与仿真结果吻合，且DMA基FAS的性能接近理想位置灵活天线。

Conclusion: 提出的分析模型为FAS的设计提供了理论支持，DMA基FAS在实际应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) have become a popular topic in the wireless
community as an effective yet simple means of exploiting spatial diversity. Due
to the limitations of physically moving radiating elements, electronically
reconfigurable antennas are emerging as practical implementations of FASs,
since changing the radiation pattern is functionally equivalent to physically
moving the device. However, electronically reconfigurable antennas pose a
challenge in terms of analytical modeling, often requiring full-wave
simulations or measurements for their characterization; this severely limits
the extraction of theoretical insights useful for system design. Motivated by
these difficulties and the growing interest in FASs, we propose in this paper a
complete analytical model for metasurface-based embodiments of FASs.
Specifically, we advocate for the implementation of the FAS concept through
dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), hitherto proposed as array replacements in
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We leverage circuit theory to
rewrite the conventional signal model of FASs in terms of admittance matrices
accounting for the electromagnetic effects inherent to metasurfaces. The model
is validated with full-wave simulations, showing good agreement. We further
illustrate how to apply the model for standard performance analysis, and
provide closed-form expressions for key metrics, including the resulting signal
covariance matrix. Results confirm that practical DMA-based FASs can achieve
similar performance to that of idealized implementations of position-flexible
antennas.

### [3] [Multiple Active STAR-RIS-Assisted Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication via Cooperative Beamforming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18035)
*Hyeonho Noh,Hyeonsu Lyu,Hyun Jong Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了由多个主动同时传输和反射的可重构智能表面（STAR-RIS）支持的集成感知与通信（ISAC）网络，通过联合优化基站波束成形和STAR-RIS反射/传输系数，最大化通信总速率，并满足感知SINR、信息泄漏限制和功率约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用STAR-RIS提升ISAC网络的性能，同时满足感知和通信的严格要求。

Method: 采用交替优化（AO）框架，将非凸问题分解为子问题，分别通过KKT条件和SCA方法求解。

Result: 仿真证明所提算法在通信总速率上显著优于被动RIS和单STAR-RIS基准，且满足感知和安全性约束。

Conclusion: 主动STAR-RIS的多表面协同优化为ISAC网络提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network
empowered by multiple active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). A base station (BS) furnishes
downlink communication to multiple users while concurrently interrogating a
sensing target. We jointly optimize the BS transmit beamformer and the
reflection/transmission coefficients of every active STAR-RIS in order to
maximize the aggregate communication sum-rate, subject to (i) a stringent
sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement, (ii) an
upper bound on the leakage of confidential information, and (iii) individual
hardware and total power constraints at both the BS and the STAR-RISs. The
resulting highly non-convex program is tackled with an efficient alternating
optimization (AO) framework. First, the original formulation is reformulated
into an equivalent yet more tractable representation and partitioned into
subproblems. The BS beamformer is updated in closed form via the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, whereas the STAR-RIS reflection and
transmission vectors are refined through successive convex approximation (SCA),
yielding a semidefinite program that is then solved via semidefinite
relaxation. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
delivers substantial sum-rate gains over passive-RIS and single STAR-RIS
baselines, all the while rigorously meeting the prescribed sensing and security
constraints.

### [4] [Geometrical portrait of Multipath error propagation in GNSS Direct Position Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18096)
*Jihong Huang,Rong Yang,Wei Gao,Xingqun Zhan,Zheng Yao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文通过几何分析量化了直接位置估计(DPE)中的多路径误差，提出了卫星圆形多路径偏置(SCMB)模型，并验证了其正确性，为从几何角度选择DPE卫星提供参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对直接位置估计(DPE)理论中多路径误差缺乏理论表征的问题，本文旨在通过几何分析量化多路径误差。

Method: 提出SCMB模型，结合多卫星通道的CAF和PVT误差，通过几何分析建立PVT偏置的边界条件，并通过蒙特卡罗模拟和城市峡谷测试验证。

Result: 研究发现最大PVT偏置取决于各卫星通道中多路径误差的最大值，且PVT偏置随卫星仰角增加而增大。

Conclusion: 研究强调了选择高、低仰角卫星组合的重要性，为优化卫星几何配置提供几何参考。

Abstract: Direct Position Estimation (DPE) is a method that directly estimate position,
velocity, and time (PVT) information from cross ambiguity function (CAF) of the
GNSS signals, significantly enhancing receiver robustness in urban
environments. However, there is still a lack of theoretical characterization on
multipath errors in the context of DPE theory. Geometric observations highlight
the unique characteristics of DPE errors stemming from multipath and thermal
noise as estimation bias and variance respectively. Expanding upon the
theoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this
paper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying
the deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative
to the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)
model is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite
channels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established
through discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness
of the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo
simulations and urban canyon tests. The findings indicate that the maximum PVT
bias depends on the largest multipath errors observed across various satellite
channels. Additionally, the PVT bias increases with satellite elevation angles,
influenced by the CAF multipath bias projection. This serves as a reference for
selecting DPE satellites from a geometric standpoint, underscoring the
importance of choosing a balanced combination of high and low elevation angles
to achieve an optimal satellite geometry configuration.

### [5] [Envelope Control Enabled Probabilistic Shaping for Peak Power Constrained IM DD Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18149)
*Dongdong Zou,Wei Wang,Jiawen Yao,Zhongxing Tian,Zeyu Feng,Huan Huang,Fan Li,Gordon Ning Liu,Gangxiang Shen,Yi Cai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的间接概率整形（PS）方案，适用于峰值功率受限（PPC）IM-DD系统，通过动态选择性映射（DSLM）和优化的接收算法，显著提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于IM-DD系统的独特模型和固有约束，特别是存在记忆效应时，概率整形技术的有效应用仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 提出了间接PS方案，通过DSLM机制动态控制信号包络，并结合改进的M-BCJR算法的turbo均衡器进行接收。

Result: 在56GBaud PAM8系统中实验验证，接收灵敏度提升1dB，并展示与典型概率幅度整形架构的兼容性。

Conclusion: 该工作为PS技术在具有记忆效应的PPC IM-DD系统中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Probabilistic shaping (PS) has attracted significant attention in
intensity-modulation and direct-detection (IM-DD) systems. However, due to the
unique system model and inherent constraints, the effective application of the
PS technique is still an open question in IM-DD systems, particularly in
systems with memory effects. In this paper, a novel indirect PS scheme tailored
for peak power constrained (PPC) IM-DD systems is proposed. The key idea lies
in strategically controlling the signal envelope to mitigate memory-induced
impairments, such as nonlinearity, overshoot, peak-to-average power ratio
enhancement, etc. The proposed scheme incorporates a dynamic selective mapping
(DSLM) mechanism at the transmitter, enabling an untypical bit-to-symbol
mapping in which the current symbol is not only determined by the current bits
pattern but also by previously generated symbols within a specified memory
length. At the receiver side, a turbo equalizer with a modified M-BCJR
algorithm is proposed to achieve the recovery of ambiguous bits induced by
DSLM. Experimental verification in a 56GBaud PAM8 system demonstrates that the
proposed scheme exhibits 1dB receiver sensitivity improvement over 2km
single-mode fiber transmission. In addition, the proposed scheme has also been
demonstrated to be compatible with the typical probabilistic amplitude shaping
architecture, enabling a simple and fine-granularity rate adaptation
capability. To the best of our knowledge, this work opens a new sight for the
application of the PS technique in PPC IM-DD systems with memory effects.

### [6] [GNSS Jammer and Spoofer Mitigation via Multi-Antenna Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18166)
*Jonas Elmiger,Gian Marti,Christoph Studer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SCHIEBER是一种新型多天线GNSS接收器方法，能够在不需预先知晓接收器位置或攻击类型的情况下，有效抑制干扰和欺骗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）信号易受干扰和欺骗攻击，需要一种无需先验知识的鲁棒防御方法。

Method: 采用自适应空间滤波技术抑制干扰攻击；基于信号到达方向（DoA）和伪距估计的一致性测试识别和拒绝欺骗攻击。

Result: 通过GPS L1 C/A系统的模拟实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SCHIEBER能够同时应对干扰和欺骗攻击，提高GNSS接收器的安全性。

Abstract: Modern positioning relies on radio signals from global navigation satellite
systems (GNSS). Their low receive power renders these radio signals susceptible
to jamming attacks, in which malicious transmitters emit strong interference to
disrupt signal acquisition. Moreover, GNSS are vulnerable to spoofing attacks,
in which malicious transmitters mimic legitimate satellites by transmitting
spurious GNSS signals. We propose SCHIEBER, a novel method for multi-antenna
GNSS receivers that mitigates jammers as well as spoofers without requiring any
prior knowledge of the receiver position or attack type: Jammers are mitigated
during signal acquisition using a recently developed adaptive spatial filtering
technique. Spoofers are identified and rejected after signal acquisition using
a novel approach that tests the consistency of acquired signals by comparing
their respective direction of arrival (DoA) and pseudorange estimates in a test
that is invariant with respect to the unknown receiver position. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our method using extensive simulations of a GPS L1 C/A system
under spoofing and jamming attacks.

### [7] [ICWLM: A Multi-Task Wireless Large Model via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18167)
*Yuxuan Wen,Xiaoming Chen,Maojun Zhang,Zhaoyang Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的无线原生基础模型ICWLM，通过多任务学习和上下文学习技术，解决了无线通信中数据稀缺和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信技术的快速发展（如mMIMO和mmWave）带来了网络复杂性和计算需求的增加。现有深度学习方法通常任务特定且难以泛化，需要新方法解决这些问题。

Method: 提出的ICWLM模型直接在大规模混合无线数据集上训练，结合上下文学习（ICL）和动态权重平均（DWA）算法，实现了多任务学习和系统配置自适应。

Result: 仿真结果表明，ICWLM在多项任务上性能与任务特定方法相当，且在未见系统配置下表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ICWLM为未来无线网络的统一自适应AI模型提供了新范式，有望降低部署复杂性并提升智能资源管理。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies, particularly
massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave),
introduces significant network complexity and computational demands.
Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer
performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are
usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model
(ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous
multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that
adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is
trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It
jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user
precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A
key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL),
enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel
conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive
retraining. Furthermore, we employ the Dynamic Weight Averaging (DWA) algorithm
to dynamically balance the individual task losses during multi-task training,
ensuring efficient and stable learning across diverse objectives. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance
compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization
capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising
paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless
networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent
resource management.

### [8] [Quantized Signal Recovery with Interference via Parametrized Look-Up Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18370)
*Morriel Kasher,Michael Tinston,Predrag Spasojevic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于参数模型的LUT方法，用于低分辨率ADC的后校正，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低分辨率ADC的非线性和宽带量化问题，提高信号恢复的准确性和实时性。

Method: 结合参数化LUT和三种分析估计器，提出针对特定信号的近似方法以简化问题。

Result: 仿真验证了信号恢复的高准确性，谐波失真消除效果显著，性能优于传统线性滤波。

Conclusion: 该方法在低分辨率、非线性或宽带量化器中表现优越，适用于多种干扰场景。

Abstract: Efficient all-digital post-correction of low-resolution analog-to-digital
converters can be achieved by using Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The performance of a
LUT can be optimized by incorporating a parametric model for the expected input
signal, noise level, and interference signals. We evaluate three analytical
estimators for integration with parametrized LUTs, especially with applications
to low-resolution, non-linear, or wideband quantizers. We also propose several
approximations to improve tractability of the estimation problem for
Phase-Shift Keyed input signals and Linear Frequency Modulated interference
signals. Simulated results validate the ability of our estimator to recover the
instantaneous value of the desired input signal in real-time with a high degree
of accuracy. This includes cancellation of harmonic distortion that aliases
into the desired signal bandwidth from front-end saturation due to high-power
out-of-band interference. Our estimators are shown to achieve a significant
gain over conventional linear-filtering techniques while also being robust to
changes in input parameters, non-linear quantizers, and time-variant
interference sources. For a tone input quantized to 3 bits and estimated with a
fixed 12-tap model order we achieve $>$10 dB improvement in Mean Square Error
and $>$20 dBc improvement in Spurious-Free Dynamic Range.

*Jérôme Emery,Ali Hasanzadeh Karkan,Jean-François Frigon,François Leduc-Primeau*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于transformer的基础模型，用于mMIMO预编码，旨在降低发射机的能耗并动态适应各用户的速率需求，同时通过数据增强方法解决了数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模MIMO系统中，深度学习模型训练需要高质量的本地数据集，但这些数据往往难以获取。因此，需要一种能够高效预编码且适应数据稀缺环境的解决方案。

Method: 采用transformer架构设计了一个基础模型，用于优化发射机能耗并动态配置用户速率需求。同时引入了一种数据增强方法，通过预训练特征提取器的输出计算余弦相似度，找到与目标分布相似的训练样本。

Result: 在相同能耗下，零样本部署的基础模型显著优于传统零强制预编码，并接近加权最小均方误差性能，同时复杂度降低了8倍。

Conclusion: 该研究通过解决数据可用性和训练复杂度问题，实现了基于深度学习的预编码在实际中的应用，同时为更高效的资源分配和调度算法提供了灵活性。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对心电图（ECG）半监督语义分割（SemiSeg）的系统性基准测试，通过整合多种公开数据集，比较了两种架构（卷积网络和Transformer）的性能，结果表明Transformer表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG自动分割技术对临床诊断至关重要，但缺乏公开标注数据集限制了深度学习的进展。半监督学习能利用大量未标注数据，为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 研究整合了多个公开ECG数据集，采用五种代表性SemiSeg算法，分别在卷积网络和Transformer架构上实现，并通过标准化评估框架比较其性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，Transformer在半监督ECG分割中优于卷积网络。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为推进半监督ECG分割方法提供了基础，并有望促进该领域进一步研究。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

Result: 在仿真研究中，模块化方法与联合状态滤波器相比表现出性能权衡，并实现通信和带宽需求降低的性能下降。

Conclusion: 模块化方法在保持性能的同时降低了通信需求，适用于子系统依赖多状态测量的场景。

Abstract: In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach
for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance
estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative
measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We
integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in
order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates
with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least
squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the
proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem,
noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position
measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation
problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized
simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic
joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we
also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful
degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth
requirements.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的位置域信道外推框架PCEnet，用于无小区大规模MIMO系统，通过用户位置信息提升信道获取效率，减少了50%的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了降低信道获取的开销，传统方法在空间、时域和频域进行信道外推。本文基于用户位置信息的唯一性和不变性，提出了一种新的位置域信道外推框架。

Method: PCEnet利用神经网络从获取的信道中推断用户位置，并通过中央处理器共享位置信息，设计导频符号或将位置信息直接用于信道重构。同时提出了简化策略和无位置标签的方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，PCEnet将导频和反馈开销减少了高达50%。

Conclusion: PCEnet框架通过用户位置信息显著提升了信道获取效率，同时减少了训练和实现的复杂度。

Abstract: To reduce channel acquisition overhead, spatial, time, and frequency-domain
channel extrapolation techniques have been widely studied. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation
framework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel
characteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel
acquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments
between different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective
channels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique
across all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages
the position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the
characteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to
assist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach
first utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the
obtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central
processing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and
concatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to
reconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition
performance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the
estimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the
pilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position
label-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the
absolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during
the localization NN training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
PCEnet framework reduces pilot and feedback overheads by up to 50%.

Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) is an emerging business model, which heavily
relies on integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), mobile edge computing
(MEC), and covert communications. This paper investigates the convert
transmission design in MEC-based networked ISAC systems towards LAE, where an
MEC server coordinates multiple access points to simultaneously receive
computation tasks from multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), locate a
target in a sensing area, and maintain UAVs' covert transmission against
multiple wardens. We first derive closed-form expressions for the detection
error probability (DEP) at wardens. Then, we formulate a total energy
consumption minimization problem by optimizing communication, sensing, and
computation resources as well as UAV trajectories, subject to the requirements
on quality of MEC services, DEP, and radar signal-to-interference-and-noise
ratio, and the causality of UAV trajectories. An alternating optimization based
algorithm is proposed to handle the considered problem, which decomposes it
into two subproblems: joint optimization of communication, sensing, and
computation resources, and UAV trajectory optimization. The former is addressed
by a successive convex approximation based algorithm, while the latter is
solved via a trust-region based algorithm. Simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with various benchmarks, and
reveal the trade-offs among communication, sensing, and computation in LAE
systems.
