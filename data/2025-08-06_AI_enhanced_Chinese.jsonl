However, this sequential design approach does not fully\naddress the trade-offs between high-frequency and LDO-induced low-frequency\nphase noise. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a co-design\nmethod for low phase-noise LC-tank VCOs powered by LDOs. It is difficult to\ncarry out the co-design using traditional manual design techniques. Hence, an\nefficient AI-driven EDA algorithm is used. To validate the proposed method, a\n5.6 GHz LC-tank VCO with an integrated LDO is designed using a 65 nm CMOS\nprocess.

To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent\nInference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference\nto correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,\neliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a\ndisentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the\ntrue pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address\nthe lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air\nQuality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor\nbenchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across\nmultiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor\ndrift and erratic sensor behavior.

Submitted to IEEE", "summary": "Orthogonal signaling limits the number of information symbols transmitted in\nbandwidth $B$ and time $T$ to be $BT$. This corresponds to the Nyquist\nsignaling and is achieved by mounting information symbols on $BT$-dimensional\nbasis spanning the $BT$-dimensional space spaced $\\frac{1}{B}$ and\n$\\frac{1}{T}$ apart. Faster-than-Nyquist signaling involves transmitting more\nthan $BT$ informational symbols in a $BT$-dimensional space. This leads to loss\nof orthogonality. This is achieved by time and/or bandwidth expansion resulting\nfrom packing more information symbols in the same $BT$-dimensional space\n(spacing less than $\\frac{1}{B}$ and/or $\\frac{1}{T}$). In this paper, we take\na different approach to faster-than-Nyquist signaling. We propose to\nsuperimpose the information symbols on one another maintaining the original\nspacing in the Nyquist signaling. We carry this out in the delay-Doppler (DD)\ndomain using Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS)\nmodulation. In Zak-OTFS, the channel varies slowly. Further Zak-OTFS also\nallows construction of mutually unbiased bases the interference between which\nappear like Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme leverages the slow variation in\nthe DD channel to construct a precoder that mitigates the effect of the\ndoubly-spread channel. Further, in the proposed scheme we mount information\nsymbols on two mutually unbiased bases which allows superposition of\ninformation symbols. This simplifies receiver processing to detection in\nGaussian noise since each basis appears to the other as Gaussian noise. This\nreduction makes it possible to use trellis coded modulation to enhance\nbit-error performance.

Radar technologies offer a promising sensing\nmodality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar\ntechnologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of\nvarious objects. However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained\nto closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data\ncollection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical\napplicability. This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful\nreasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material\ncomposition from raw radar signals? Answering this question is non-trivial due\nto the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs\nhave no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we\nintroduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using\nLLM to identify materials directly from radar signals. First, we introduce a\nphysics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar\nraw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the\nmaterial's intrinsic characteristics. Second, we adopt a retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) strategy to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge,\nenabling it to interpret and reason over the extracted intermediate parameters.\nLeveraging this integration, the LLM is empowered to perform step-by-step\nreasoning on the condensed radar features, achieving open-set material\nrecognition directly from raw radar signals.

DTDD enables the CF mMIMO system to\nconcurrently serve both uplink~(UL) and downlink~(DL) users with spatially\nseparated \\emph{half-duplex~(HD)} access points~(APs) using the same\ntime-frequency resources. Further, to facilitate ISAC, the UL APs are utilized\nfor both UL data and target echo reception, while the DL APs jointly transmit\nthe precoded DL data streams and target signal. In this context, we present\ncentralized and distributed generalized likelihood-ratio tests~(GLRTs) for\ntarget detection treating UL users' signals as sensing interference. We then\nquantify the optimality and complexity trade-off between distributed and\ncentralized GLRTs and benchmark the respective estimators with the Bayesian\nCram\\'er-Rao lower bound for target radar-cross section~(RCS). Then, we present\na unified framework for joint UL users' data detection and RCS estimation.\nNext, for communication, we derive the signal-to-noise-plus-interference~(SINR)\noptimal combiner accounting for the cross-link and radar interference for UL\ndata processing. In DL, we use regularized zero-forcing for the users and\npropose two types of precoders for the target: one ``user-centric\" that\nnullifies the interference caused by the target signal to the DL users and one\n``target-centric\" based on the dominant eigenvector of the composite channel\nbetween the target and the APs.

In this\npaper, we address an unequal error protection (UEP) problem in digital semantic\ncommunication, where bits of higher semantic importance require stronger\nprotection. To quantify bit-level importance, we leverage bit-flip\nprobabilities of semantic bits as target error protection levels, which are\njointly learned with semantic encoder and decoder. We propose two novel channel\ncoding frameworks aimed at minimizing the total blocklength while satisfying\nUEP constraints. First, we develop a bit-level UEP framework based on\nrepetition coding, in which the repetition number for each bit is optimized to\nprecisely meet its target bit-flip probability. Second, we introduce a\nblock-level UEP framework utilizing modern channel codes, where semantic bits\nwith similar target bit-flip probabilities are grouped to exploit coding gains.\nWithin this framework, we propose a bit-grouping algorithm guided by finite\nblocklength capacity analysis.

Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the\namount of information leaked about the institution database to the user,\ncompared to the baseline scheme.

Here, the\nuser retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of\ntheir features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their\nfeature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we\npropose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically,\nbut ensure varying degrees of database privacy.
