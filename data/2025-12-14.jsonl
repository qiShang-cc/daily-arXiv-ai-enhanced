In this paper, we analyze the impact of receiver in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance and residual carrier frequency offset (CFO) error on AFDM signals. Our analysis shows that the receiver IQ imbalance may not preserve the sparsity of the AFDM effective channel matrix because of the complex-conjugate operator of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). Moreover, the residual CFO error causes energy leakage in the effective channel matrix in the affine domain. To mitigate these effects, we extend the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) detector to handle the improper Gaussian noise arising from the receiver IQ imbalance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LMMSE detector effectively compensates for the receiver hardware impairments."}

Survey of RTLS adoption barriers for small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises", "summary": "Real-time location systems (RTLSs) are central to Industry 4.0 and emerging Industry 5.0, providing the spatiotemporal data required for asset tracking, workflow optimization, safety, and integration with WMS, MES, and digital twins. While large enterprises increasingly deploy RTLSs, adoption among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains limited. This paper examines whether cost and installation complexity are primary barriers to SME adoption. We position RTLSs within the broader Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 landscape and summarize their operational value. We then synthesize evidence from the literature on technical, financial, and organizational constraints, with emphasis on infrastructure requirements, calibration effort, integration with legacy systems, and human factors. To complement this analysis, we report results from an online survey of sixteen manufacturing and technology professionals in Canada and the United States. Respondents report strong perceived value for real-time tracking but identify upfront cost, installation effort, integration difficulty, and reliance on multiple anchor nodes as dominant obstacles. Most indicate acceptable upfront investments below $10,000 and express a clear preference for low-infrastructure deployments with minimized anchor counts. Building on these findings, we outline design directions for SME-focused RTLSs, including wireless and modular architectures, cloud-managed and self-calibrating systems, standardized integration interfaces, and anchor-minimizing or anchor-free localization methods. Overall, the results show that limited SME adoption stems less from insufficient perceived value than from misalignment between current RTLS deployment models and SME resource constraints."}

This chapter provides an overview of graph topology identification and statistical inference methods for multidimensional relational data. Approaches for undirected links connecting graph nodes are outlined, going all the way from correlation metrics to covariance selection, and revealing ties with smooth signal priors. To account for directional (possibly causal) relations among nodal variables and address the limitations of linear time-invariant models in handling dynamic as well as nonlinear dependencies, a principled framework is surveyed to capture these complexities through judiciously selected kernels from a prescribed dictionary. Generalizations are also described via structural equations and vector autoregressions that can exploit attributes such as low rank, sparsity, acyclicity, and smoothness to model dynamic processes over possibly time-evolving topologies. It is argued that this approach supports both batch and online learning algorithms with convergence rate guarantees, is amenable to tensor (that is, multi-way array) formulations as well as decompositions that are well-suited for multidimensional network data, and can seamlessly leverage high-order statistical information."}

One representative of use cases is crowd flow estimation on outdoor streets. However, most existing studies have focused on indoor environments or vehicles, and demonstrations of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE base station remain limited. This study addresses this use case and proposes an analysis of a crowd flow estimation method using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) obtained from a commercial LTE base station. Specifically, pedestrian counts derived from a camera-based object recognition algorithm were associated with the variance of RSRP. The features obtained from the variance were quantitatively evaluated by combining a CatBoost regression model with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Through this investigation, we clarified that an optimal variance window size for RSRP is 0.1 to 0.2 seconds and that enlarging the counting area increased the features obtained from the variance of RSRP, for machine learning. Consequently, this study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE, while also revealing the characteristic behavior of variance window size and counting area size in feature design."}

The large aperture of ELAA introduces spatial non-stationarity, where far-apart users have significantly distinct visibility at the antennas, thereby reducing inter-user interference. This insight motivates our novel pilot scheme to group users with distinct visibility regions to share the same frequency subcarriers for channel estimation, so that more users can be served with reduced pilot overhead. Specifically, the proposed pilot scheme employs frequency-division multiplexing for inter-group channel estimation, while intra-group users -- benefiting from strong spatial orthogonality -- are distinguished by shifted cyclic codes, similar to code-division multiplexing. Additionally, we introduce a sub-array structured ELAA, where each sub-array is a traditional MIMO array and treated as spatial stationary, while the distances between sub-arrays can be significantly larger to achieve an expanded aperture. The channel support for sub-arrays features clustered sparsity in the antenna-delay domain and is modeled by a 2-dimensional (2-D) Markov random field (MRF). Based on this, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation algorithm within a turbo Bayesian inference framework that incorporates the 2-D MRF prior model. Simulations show that the proposed scheme and algorithm allow the XL-MIMO system to support more users, and deliver superior channel estimation performance."}

Exploiting this redundancy is crucial for achieving the desired workspace and dexterity required for the feasibility and optimisation of toolpath planning. Inverse kinematics algorithms can solve this in a fast, reactive framework, but these techniques are underutilised over the more computationally expensive offline planning methods. We propose a novel algorithm to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics for robotic manipulation utilising a task space decomposition approach, the damped least-squares method and Halley's method to achieve fast and robust solutions with reduced joint motion. We evaluate our methodology in the case of toolpath optimisation in a cold spray coating application on a non-planar surface. The functionally redundant inverse kinematics algorithm can quickly solve motion plans that minimise joint motion, expanding the feasible operating space of the complex toolpath. We validate our approach on an industrial ABB manipulator and cold-spray gun executing the computed toolpath."}

Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue."}

The Contextual Reward Machine reduces task complexity by decomposing grasping tasks into manageable sub-tasks.

This contextual information enables efficient intra-stage guidance and improves learning efficiency by reducing the state-action space and guiding exploration within clearly defined boundaries. In addition, transition rewards are introduced to encourage or penalize transitions between stages which guides the model toward desirable stage sequences and further accelerates convergence.

However, ensuring secure information transmission while maintaining high-quality sensing performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate an integrated sensing and covert communication (ISCC) system, in which a base station (BS) simultaneously serves multiple downlink users and senses malicious targets that may act as both potential eavesdroppers (Eves) and wardens. We propose a novel symbol-level precoding (SLP)-based waveform design for ISCC that achieves covert communication intrinsically, without requiring additional transmission resources such as artificial noise. The proposed design integrates symbol shaping to enhance reliability for legitimate users and noise shaping to obscure transmission activities from the targets. For imperfect channel state information (CSI), the framework incorporates bounded uncertainty models for user channels and target angles, yielding a more robust design. The resulting ISCC waveform optimization problem is non-convex; to address this, we develop a low-complexity proximal distance algorithm (PDA) with closed-form updates under both PSK and QAM modulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior covertness and sensing-communication performance with negligible degradation compared to traditional beamforming and conventional SLP approaches without noise-shaping mechanisms."}

Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2). Our experiments on a simulated JetBot, and on a real MBot, suggest that by considering the configuration space's structure, our symmetry-informed nonconformity score leads to more volume-efficient prediction regions which represent the underlying uncertainty better than existing approaches."}

For obstacle avoidance, in simulation, we replace the rule-based controller with a fully learnable point-goal policy, and in real-world deployment, we design a LiDAR-based clustering module for generating navigable waypoints and pair it with an online SLAM-based local controller. CLASH achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results (ranking 1-st) on the VLN-CE leaderboard, significantly improving SR and SPL on the test-unseen set over the previous SoTA methods.

However, since the signal of interest (SI) of a wireless communication system acts as estimation noise, i.e., interference, to KIC, the SI limits the extent to which the known interference (KI) can be canceled and that in turn limits the throughput of the wireless communication system that is being hidden or secured. In this letter, we analyze a decision feedback-aided known-interference cancellation (DF-KIC) structure in which both the KI and SI are canceled iteratively and successively. Measurement results demonstrate that introducing decision feedback to KIC improves its KI cancellation capability and hence increases the wireless communication system's useful throughput, albeit at the expense of a higher computational load."}

In such systems, ML-based localization typically relies on dense grid search, incurring prohibitive computational complexity. To address this, we introduce phase-only localization (POLO), an approach that leverages differential carrier-phase measurements from selected APs to generate a compact set of candidate user positions. The ML cost function is then evaluated only at these candidates, reducing complexity significantly. A key challenge is to devise an AP selection mechanism that reduces the number of candidate points while maintaining reliable coverage. We propose two variants: POLO-I, which selects three APs to provide closed-form candidate positions with low computational cost, and POLO-II, which selects four APs using an alternative strategy that enhances coverage at marginally higher runtime. Comprehensive analytical and simulation results show that POLO achieves a favorable coverage-complexity trade-off, reducing cost by orders of magnitude relative to exhaustive grid search with only marginal loss in coverage. By characterizing this tradeoff under diverse AP configurations, we also provide practical guidelines for selecting between POLO-I and POLO-II depending on latency and coverage requirements."}

However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. \"Swaddling\" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average.

The system uses chest-mounted IMU-based PDR as the motion backbone and integrates absolute updates from GNSS outdoors and UWB indoors. To enhance transition robustness and mitigate urban GNSS degradation, we introduce a lightweight map-based feasibility constraint derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints, treating most building interiors as non-navigable while allowing motion inside a designated UWB-instrumented building. The framework is implemented in ROS 2 and runs in real time on a wearable platform, with visualization in Foxglove.

The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems.

Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue."}

Training of novice pilots is protracted due to the lack of functional and easily accessible training simulators. Moreover, work on parafoil trajectory planning suitable for aiding human training remains limited. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of computing safe trajectories for human-piloted parafoil flight and examine how such trajectories fare against human-generated solutions. For the algorithmic part, we adapt the sampling-based motion planner Stable Sparse RRT (SST) by Li et al., to cope with the problem constraints while minimizing the bank angle (control effort) as a proxy for safety. We then compare the computer-generated solutions with data from human-generated parafoil flight, where the algorithm offers a relative cost improvement of 20\\%-80\\% over the performance of the human pilot. We observe that human pilots tend to, first, close the horizontal distance to the landing area, and then address the vertical gap by spiraling down to the suitable altitude for starting a landing maneuver. The algorithm considered here makes smoother and more gradual descents, arriving at the landing area at the precise altitude necessary for the final approach while maintaining safety constraints. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of computer-generated guidelines, rather than traditional rules of thumb, which can be integrated into future simulators to train pilots for safer and more cost-effective flights."}

In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator."}

Assuming that the hyperspectral image follows the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, we develop a data reduction technique that removes pixels that do not contain endmembers. We analyze the theoretical properties of this reduction step and show that it preserves pixels that lie close to the endmembers.

In light of this, we investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be leveraged to improve safety in multi-vehicle-following scenarios involving emergency braking. Specifically, we investigate how DRL with vehicle-to-vehicle communication can be used to ethically select an emergency breaking profile in scenarios where overall, or collective, three-vehicle harm reduction or collision avoidance shall be obtained instead of single-vehicle such. As an algorithm, we provide a hybrid approach that combines DRL with a previously published method based on analytical expressions for selecting optimal constant deceleration.

Comparisons show that boresight-error deviations and path-loss differences between the rigorous method and the uniform-plane-wave approximation remain negligible, even under heavy precipitation. Although rays in a lossy atmosphere experience different phase- and attenuation-direction vectors-forming non-uniform plane waves-the resulting effective attenuation along the path is nearly identical to that predicted by the uniform-plane-wave model. These findings justify the continued use of uniform-plane-wave ray tracing in practical LEO link analyses."}

Neither of the proposed frameworks, however, can achieve satisfactory performance when facing a platform residual phase error (PRPE) arising from the instability of airborne platforms. More importantly, in spite of the significance of real-time processing requirements in remote sensing applications, these prior works have only focused on enhancing the quality of the formed image, not reducing the computational burden. To address these two concerns, this article presents a fast and unified joint SAR imaging framework where the dominant sparse objects and low-rank features of the image background are decomposed and enhanced through a robust LRSD. In particular, our unified algorithm circumvents the tedious task of computing the inverse of large matrices for image formation and takes advantage of the recent advances in constrained quadratic programming to handle the unimodular constraint imposed due to the PRPE. Furthermore, we extend our approach to ISAR autofocusing and imaging. Specifically, due to the intrinsic sparsity of ISAR images, the LRSD framework is essentially tasked with the recovery of a sparse image. Several experiments based on synthetic and real data are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of imaging quality and computational cost compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}

Analytical models lose fidelity under these nonlinear and nonstationary effects, while standard data-driven methods such as deep neural networks and Gaussian processes cannot represent the diverse residual behaviors that arise across different operating conditions. We propose a regime-conditioned diffusion framework that models the full distribution of residual forces using a conditional diffusion process and a lightweight temporal encoder. The encoder extracts a compact summary of recent motion and configuration, enabling consistent residual predictions even through abrupt transitions or unseen payloads. When combined with an adaptive controller, the framework enables dynamics uncertainty compensation and yields markedly improved tracking accuracy in real-world tests."}

However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link becomes a non-linear function of its network context, including network topology, link quality, and the traffic assigned to neighboring links. In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed NDT accurately predicts link duty cycles and congestion patterns with up to a 5000x speedup over packet-level simulation, and enables us to optimize link scheduling using gradient descent for reduced congestion and radio footprint."}

We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations."}

We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.\n  The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge."}

In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end visual-force diffusion policy that integrates visual planning and reactive force control within a single network. We introduce Structural Slow-Fast Learning, a mechanism utilizing causal attention to simultaneously process asynchronous visual and force tokens, allowing the policy to perform closed-loop adjustments at the force frequency while maintaining the temporal coherence of action chunks. Furthermore, to mitigate modality collapse where end-to-end models fail to adjust the weights across different modalities, we propose Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization. This auxiliary objective maps force feedback into the same space as the action, providing a stronger, physics-grounded learning signal than raw force prediction. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms both vision-only and hierarchical baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with a streamlined training pipeline.

The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem."}

The system first uses LiDAR to identify the distinct reflective signatures of sensors within the field, then dynamically redirects the camera s field of view via the FSM to target each sensor for hyperspectral imaging. The liquid lens continuously adjusts focus to maintain image sharpness across varying depths, enabling precise spectral measurements.

Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines."}

Traditional approaches rely on external sensors or simplify vehicle dynamics, which limits their applicability during agile flight or in resource-constrained platforms.

The approach first estimates external aerodynamic forces using a disturbance observer (DOB), and then maps these forces to wind vectors using a thin-plate spline (TPS) model. A custom-designed wind barrel mounted on the UAV enhances aerodynamic sensitivity, further improving estimation accuracy. The system is validated through comprehensive experiments in wind tunnels, indoor and outdoor flights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high-accuracy wind estimation across controlled and real-world conditions, with speed RMSEs as low as \\SI{0.06}{m/s} in wind tunnel tests, \\SI{0.22}{m/s} during outdoor hover, and below \\SI{0.38}{m/s} in indoor and outdoor dynamic flights, and direction RMSEs under \\ang{7.3} across all scenarios, outperforming existing baselines.

These regions enable the relaxation of probabilistic constraints while providing formal guarantees. By employing an indirect feedback mechanism and a probabilistic set-based formulation, we prove recursive feasibility of the relaxed optimization problem and establish chance constraint satisfaction in closed-loop. Furthermore, we extend the approach to the more general output feedback setting with unknown measurement noise distributions. Given available noise samples, we establish satisfaction of the joint chance constraints and recursive feasibility via output measurements alone.

While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers."}

The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions.

Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences (\"chunks\") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks.
