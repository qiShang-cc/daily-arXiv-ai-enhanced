### [1] [DOA Estimation via Continuous Aperture Arrays: MUSIC and CRLB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21347)
*Haonan Si,Zhaolin Wang,Xiansheng Guo,Jin Zhang,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对连续孔径阵列（CAPA）的新型MUSIC算法，通过等效连续-离散变换和高斯-勒让德积分降低计算复杂度，显著提升了DOA估计的精度和自由度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散阵列（SPDA）在DOA估计中自由度有限，而CAPA虽能提升自由度，但其连续信号使常规算法无法直接应用。需要新算法解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出等效连续-离散变换实现连续算子特征分解，利用高斯-勒让德积分近似MUSIC谱以降低计算复杂度。分析了有/无先验信号知识下的CRLB。

Result: 理论证明CAPA显著优于SPDA，数值结果验证了算法有效性，实现了近最优估计性能且计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: 所提算法为CAPA的DOA估计提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了精度和性能。

Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using continuous aperture array (CAPA)
is studied. Compared to the conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), CAPA
significantly enhances the spatial degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs) for DOA
estimation, but its infinite-dimensional continuous signals render the
conventional estimation algorithm non-applicable. To address this challenge, a
new multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is proposed for CAPAs. In
particular, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation is proposed to
facilitate the eigendecomposition of continuous operators. Subsequently, the
MUSIC spectrum is accurately approximated using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature,
effectively reducing the computational complexity. Furthermore, the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for DOA estimation using CAPAs are analyzed
for both cases with and without priori knowledge of snapshot signals. It is
theoretically proved that CAPAs significantly improve the DOA estimation
accuracy compared to traditional SPDAs. Numerical results further validate this
insight and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MUSIC algorithm for
CAPA. The proposed method achieves near-optimal estimation performance while
maintaining a low computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来生产过程中代理将替代传统机器或人，需要一种专为代理通信设计的AI原生系统。现有LLM输出的人类语言不适合此类通信。

Conclusion: 该系统为代理通信提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement in large foundation models is propelling the paradigm
shifts across various industries. One significant change is that agents,
instead of traditional machines or humans, will be the primary participants in
the future production process, which consequently requires a novel AI-native
communication system tailored for agent communications. Integrating the ability
of large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented semantic communication is a
potential approach. However, the output of existing LLM is human language,
which is highly constrained and sub-optimal for agent-type communication. In
this paper, we innovatively propose a task-oriented agent communication system.
Specifically, we leverage the original LLM to learn a specialized machine
language represented by token embeddings. Simultaneously, a multi-modal LLM is
trained to comprehend the application task and to extract essential implicit
information from multi-modal inputs, subsequently expressing it using machine
language tokens. This representation is significantly more efficient for
transmission over the air interface. Furthermore, to reduce transmission
overhead, we introduce a joint token and channel coding (JTCC) scheme that
compresses the token sequence by exploiting its sparsity while enhancing
robustness against channel noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach reduces transmission overhead for downstream tasks while enhancing
accuracy relative to the SOTA methods.

### [3] [Two-Dimensional Nonseparable Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21511)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的2D非可分分数阶傅里叶变换（NSFRFT），解决了现有2D FRFT的限制，并在应用中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D FRFT在理论统一性、非可分信号处理及与Wigner分布的旋转关系方面存在不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入2D NSFRFT，具有四种自由度，包含现有2D FRFT为特例，并保持更一般的4D旋转关系。

Result: 数值模拟和实验表明2D NSFRFT在图像加密、解密、滤波和去噪中表现优异。

Conclusion: 2D NSFRFT为2D非平稳信号处理提供了更通用的方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) generalizes the
1D Fourier transform, offering significant advantages in time-frequency
analysis of non-stationary signals. To extend the benefits of the 1D FRFT to
higher-dimensional signals, 2D FRFTs, such as the 2D separable FRFT (SFRFT),
gyrator transform (GT), and coupled FRFT (CFRFT), have been developed. However,
existing 2D FRFTs suffer from several limitations: (1) a lack of theoretical
uniformity and general applicability, (2) an inability to handle 2D
non-stationary signals with nonseparable terms, and (3) failure to maintain a
consistent 4D rotational relationship with the 2D Wigner distribution (WD),
which is essential for ensuring geometric consistency and symmetry in
time-frequency analysis. These limitations restrict the methods' performance in
practical applications, such as radar, communication, sonar, and optical
imaging, in which nonseparable terms frequently arise. To address these
challenges, we introduce a more general definition of the 2D FRFT, termed the
2D nonseparable FRFT (NSFRFT). The 2D NSFRFT has four degrees of freedom,
includes the 2D SFRFT, GT, and CFRFT as special cases, and maintains a more
general 4D rotational relationship with the 2D WD. We derive its properties and
present three discrete algorithms, two of which are fast algorithms with
computational complexity $O(N^2 \log N)$ comparable to that of the 2D SFRFT.
Numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
the 2D NSFRFT in applications such as image encryption, decryption, filtering,
and denoising.

Abstract: To address limitations of the graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT)
Wiener filtering and the traditional joint time-vertex fractional Fourier
transform (JFRFT) Wiener filtering, this study proposes a filtering method
based on the hyper-differential form of the JFRFT. The gradient backpropagation
mechanism is employed to enable the adaptive selection of transform order pair
and filter coefficients. First, leveraging the hyper-differential form of the
GFRFT and the fractional Fourier transform, the hyper-differential form of the
JFRFT is constructed and its properties are analyzed. Second, time-varying
graph signals are divided into dynamic graph sequences of equal span along the
temporal dimension. A spatiotemporal joint representation is then established
through vectorized reorganization, followed by the joint time-vertex Wiener
filtering. Furthermore, by rigorously proving the differentiability of the
transform orders, both the transform orders and filter coefficients are
embedded as learnable parameters within a neural network architecture. Through
gradient backpropagation, their synchronized iterative optimization is
achieved, constructing a parameters-adaptive learning filtering framework. This
method leverages a model-driven approach to learn the optimal transform order
pair and filter coefficients. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
framework improves the time-varying graph signals denoising performance, while
reducing the computational burden of the traditional grid search strategy.

### [5] [Causal Link Discovery with Unequal Edge Error Tolerance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21570)
*Joni Shaska,Urbashi Mitra*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Neyman-Pearson因果发现的新型框架，专注于非对称错误控制，旨在最小化一类错误同时将另一类错误控制在用户指定范围内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前最先进的因果发现算法未区分不同类型的边错误，也无法提供有限样本下的错误保证。

Method: 结合信息论技术，利用Rényi散度分析性能极限；针对线性加性高斯噪声模型，提出了epsilon-CUT算法。

Result: 发现性能极限由Rényi散度刻画；epsilon-CUT算法在有限样本下控制了假阳性率，且与其他先进方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: Neyman-Pearson因果发现框架为因果发现提供了更灵活的误差控制方法，适用于边错误重要性不同的场景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for causal discovery with asymmetric
error control, called Neyman-Pearson causal discovery. Despite the importance
of applications where different types of edge errors may have different
importance, current state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms do not
differentiate between the types of edge errors, nor provide any finite-sample
guarantees on the edge errors. Hence, this framework seeks to minimize one type
of error while keeping the other below a user-specified tolerance level. Using
techniques from information theory, fundamental performance limits are found,
characterized by the R\'enyi divergence, for Neyman-Pearson causal discovery.
Furthermore, a causal discovery algorithm is introduced for the case of linear
additive Gaussian noise models, called epsilon-CUT, that provides finite-sample
guarantees on the false positive rate, while staying competitive with
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are foundational for downlink multi-user
(MU) communication in future wireless networks, for their ability to enhance
spectral efficiency and support a large number of users simultaneously.
However, high user density intensifies severe inter-user interference (IUI) and
pilot overhead. Consequently, existing blind and semi-blind channel estimation
(CE) and signal detection (SD) algorithms suffer performance degradation and
increased complexity, especially when further challenged by frequency-selective
channels and high-order modulation demands. To this end, this paper proposes a
novel semi-blind joint channel estimation and signal detection (JCESD) method.
Specifically, the proposed approach employs a hybrid precoding architecture to
suppress IUI. Furthermore we formulate JCESD as a non-convex constellation
fitting optimization exploiting constellation affine invariance. Few pilots are
used to achieve coarse estimation for initialization and ambiguity resolution.
For high-order modulations, a data augmentation mechanism utilizes the symmetry
of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations to increase the
effective number of samples. To address frequency-selective channels, CE
accuracy is then enhanced via an iterative refinement strategy that leverages
improved SD results. Simulation results demonstrate an average throughput gain
of 11\% over widely used pilot-based methods in MU scenarios, highlighting the
proposed method's potential to improve spectral efficiency.

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO is a key 6G technology, offering superior spectral and
energy efficiency. However, its dense deployment of low-cost access points
(APs) makes hardware impairments unavoidable. While narrowband impairments are
well-studied, their impact in wideband systems remains unexplored. This paper
provides the first comprehensive analysis of hardware impairments, such as
nonlinear distortion in low-noise amplifiers, phase noise, in-phase-quadrature
imbalance, and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, on uplink spectral
efficiency in cell-free massive MIMO. Using an OFDM waveform and centralized
processing, APs share channel state information for joint uplink combining.
Leveraging Bussgang decomposition, we derive a distortion-aware combining
vector that optimizes spectral efficiency by modeling distortion as independent
colored noise.

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a key enabler for
the sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks, offering significant spectral and
energy efficiency gains through user-centric operation of distributed access
points (APs). However, its reliance on low-cost APs introduces inevitable
hardware impairments, whose combined impact on wideband downlink systems
remains unexplored when analyzed using behavioral models. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) in cell-free
massive MIMO-OFDM systems under practical hardware impairments, including phase
noise and third-order power amplifier nonlinearities. Both centralized and
distributed precoding strategies are examined. By leveraging the Bussgang
decomposition, we derive an SE expression and quantify the relative impact of
impairments through simulations. Our results reveal that phase noise causes
more severe degradation than power amplifier distortions, especially in
distributed operation, highlighting the need for future distortion-aware
precoding designs.

Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implemented in
virtualized cloud radio access networks (V-CRAN) has emerged as a promising
architecture to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), network flexibility, and
energy efficiency (EE) in next-generation wireless systems. In this work, we
develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of
cell-free massive MIMO in V-CRAN with multiple mobile network operators (MNOs).
Specifically, we formulate a set of mixed-integer programming (MIP) models to
jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association,
cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum
total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios
based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical
results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power
consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces
TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in
cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless
network implementations.

Abstract: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN)
infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future
6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous

with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and
effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework
for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform
candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of
promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and

offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable
physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all,
this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a

followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion
of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and
representative requirements.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a bistatic integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) system, consisting of a multi-antenna base station (BS),
a multi-antenna sensing receiver, a single-antenna communication user (CU), and
a point target to be sensed. Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of
Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver
information symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the
target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by
processing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the
sequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the
information signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of
the information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive
the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose
practical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we
formulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to
minimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS.
When the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting
beamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an
optimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic
sensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a
locally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex
approximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing
Gaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for
target sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior
ISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes.

Conclusion: 近场RSMA-RIS集成在隐蔽通信中表现出显著优势，为未来相关研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: This paper explores the near field (NF) covert communication with the aid of
rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RIS). In particular, the RIS operates in the NF of both the legitimate user
and the passive adversary, enhancing the legitimate users received signal while
suppressing the adversarys detection capability. Whereas, the base station (BS)
applies RSMA to increase the covert communication rate composed of a private
and a shared rate component. To characterize system covertness, we derive
closed form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP), outage
probability (OP), and optimal detection threshold for the adversary. We
formulate a non-convex joint beamforming optimization problem at the BS and RIS
under unit-modulus constraints to maximize the covert rate. To tackle this, we
propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, where the BS beamformer is
designed using a two-stage iterative method based on successive convex
approximation (SCA). Additionally, two low-complexity techniques are introduced
to further reduce the adversarys received power. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the covert communication rate,
highlighting the potential of near field RSMA-RIS integration in covert

Conclusion: Zak-OTFS-based CRA适用于未来mMTC部署，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a grant-free coded random access (CRA) scheme for uplink
massive machine-type communications (mMTC), based on Zak-orthogonal time
frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation in the delay-Doppler domain. The scheme
is tailored for doubly selective wireless channels, where conventional
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CRA suffers from
unreliable inter-slot channel prediction due to time-frequency variability. By
exploiting the predictable nature of Zak-OTFS, the proposed approach enables
accurate channel estimation across slots, facilitating reliable successive
interference cancellation across user packet replicas. A fair comparison with
an OFDM-based CRA baseline shows that the proposed scheme achieves
significantly lower packet loss rates under high mobility and user density.
Extensive simulations over the standardized Veh-A channel confirm the
robustness and scalability of Zak-OTFS-based CRA, supporting its applicability
to future mMTC deployments.

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 射线追踪模拟器的精度常因测量数据不足和缺乏系统验证而受限，本文旨在通过位置校准和验证提升其准确性。

Method: 提出一种位置校准算法，通过优化TX-RX位置以对齐仿真与实测功率延迟分布，提高位置精度。

Result: 校准后TX-RX位置精度显著提升（LOS提升42.3%，NLOS提升13.5%），路径损耗预测误差低于0.14。

Conclusion: 已验证的NYURay为6G部署提供了可靠的射线追踪工具。

Abstract: Ray-tracing (RT) simulators are essential for wireless digital twins,
enabling accurate site-specific radio channel prediction for next-generation
wireless systems. Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient
measurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents
site-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray
tracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a
location calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by
optimizing transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations to align simulated and
measured power delay profiles, improving TX-RX location accuracy by 42.3% for
line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.
Validation across 18 TX-RX locations shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss
prediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14. While RT
underestimates delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions
remain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and
provides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分布式算法，用于解决无小区大规模MIMO系统中的活动检测和导频污染问题，结合了最大似然估计和变分贝叶斯期望传播方法，提高了收敛性和初始化鲁棒性。

Motivation: 随着物联网设备数量的激增，无小区大规模MIMO系统中的免授权接入方案需要高效的分布式算法来解决活动检测和导频污染问题。

Abstract: Cell-Free (CF) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MaMIMO) is considered
one of the leading candidates for enabling next-generation wireless
communication. With the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the
Grant-Free (GF) access scheme has emerged as a promising solution to support
massive device connectivity. The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces
significant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for
activity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we
propose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method
first employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML)
approach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data
portions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid
Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint
data detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the
proposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced
sensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a
finite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated
posterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing
(MP) algorithm from diverging. To compute the pseudo prior in a distributed
fashion, we further develop a distributed version of the Variable-Level
Expectation Propagation (VL-EP) algorithm.

### [18] [Beamforming Saturation in Two-Timescale RIS-assisted Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21776)
*Masoud Sadeghian,Angel Lozano,Gabor Fodor*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于可重构智能表面（RIS）的无线通信，重点关注双时间尺度方法。结果表明，虽然RIS捕获的功率随其元素数量线性增长，但其向接收器的双时间尺度波束成形增益在元素数量增加时会迅速饱和，最终增益由功率角度谱的衰减率决定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过双时间尺度方法优化RIS相位偏移以减少信道估计开销，探讨RIS在无线通信中的有效性。

Method: 采用双时间尺度方法，基于信道统计优化RIS相位偏移，并分析RIS元素数量对波束成形增益的影响。

Result: 研究表明，RIS捕获的功率与元素数量线性增长，但波束成形增益随元素数量迅速饱和，且最终增益取决于功率角度谱的衰减率。

Conclusion: RIS在通信中的有效性受限于其元素间的空间相关性衰减速度，双时间尺度方法虽能减少开销，但增益存在饱和现象。

Abstract: This paper considers wireless communication assisted by a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS), focusing on the two-timescale approach, in which the
RIS phase shifts are optimized based on channel statistics to mitigate the
overheads associated with channel estimation. It is shown that, while the power
captured by the RIS scales linearly with the number of its elements, the
two-timescale beamforming gain upon re-radiation towards the receiver saturates
rapidly as the number of RIS elements increases, for a broad class of power
angular spectra (PAS). The ultimate achievable gain is determined by the decay
rate of the PAS in the angular domain, which directly influences how rapidly
spatial correlations between RIS elements diminish. The implications of this
saturation on the effectiveness of RIS-assisted communications are discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RIS辅助网络中PDPR优化的效果，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 在RIS辅助的通信场景下，基于信道统计调整RIS相位，推导出闭式解以优化PDPR。

Result: 在宏蜂窝部署场景中，PDPR优化带来了显著优势，特别是在RIS元素数量或信道相关性增加时。

Conclusion: 优化PDPR在RIS辅助网络中效果显著，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The optimization of the \gls{pdpr} is a recourse that helps wireless systems
to acquire channel state information while minimizing the pilot overhead. While
the optimization of the \gls{pdpr} in cellular networks has been studied
extensively, the effect of the \gls{pdpr} in \gls{ris}-assisted networks has
hardly been examined. This paper tackles this optimization when the
communication is assisted by a RIS whose phase shifts are adjusted on the basis
of the statistics of the channels. For a setting representative of a
macrocellular deployment, the benefits of optimizing the PDPR are seen to be
significant over a broad range of operating conditions. These benefits,
demonstrated through the ergodic minimum mean squared error, for which a
closed-form solution is derived, become more pronounced as the number of RIS
elements and/or the channel coherence grow large.

Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population.
Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing
pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management
strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and
support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent
functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second
Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The
proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input
signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer
alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover,
experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly
optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger
counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both
short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby
enhancing the model's representational capacity.
