The receiver platform is in motion, while the sources\nare assumed to be stationary.

To bridge this gap, we\npropose a deep learning-based framework that leverages semantic segmentation\nmodels for multi source localization. Specifically, we employ UNet and UNetPP\nas backbone models, processing input images that encode the platform's\npositions along with the corresponding direction finding lines at each\nposition. By analyzing the intersections of these lines, the models effectively\nidentify and localize multiple sources. Through simulations, we evaluate both\nsingle- and multi-source localization scenarios.

However, the power\nconsumption of conventional IRSs cannot be ignored due to the large number of\nreflecting elements and control circuits. To balance performance and power\nconsumption, we previously proposed a heterogeneous-IRS (HE-IRS), a green IRS\nstructure integrating dynamically tunable elements (DTEs) and statically\ntunable elements (STEs). Compared to conventional IRSs with only DTEs, the\nunique DTE-STE integrated structure introduces new challenges in both channel\nestimation and beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the channel\nestimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel\nestimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated\nis decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent\nchannel. Leveraging it along with the inherent sparsity of DTE- and STE-based\nchannels and manifold optimization, we propose an efficient channel estimation\nscheme. To address the rank mismatch problem in the imperfect channel sparsity\ninformation, a robust rank selection rule is developed.

The architecture incorporates a single or multiple\nradio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase\nprofiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller\nencompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and\nconsequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel\nchannel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal\ntraining pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable\nabsorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its\nsignal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly\nused by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase\nconfiguration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation\nalgorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the\nentire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank\nproperties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for\ncommunication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical\ninvestigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation\ntechnique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware\nconfiguration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel\nestimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized\nreflection coefficients of its unit elements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u534a\u88ab\u52a8\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08RIS\uff09\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347MIMO\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u5c04\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbRIS\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u6bb5\uff08\u5982FR3\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e8f\u5217\u548cADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RIS\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5438\u6536\u91c7\u6837\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\u5b8c\u6210\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u7cfb\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cRIS\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316RIS\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RIS\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u9891MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and\nreliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents\nand increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this\ncontext is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the\nreliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter\nvariations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may\naffect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In\nthis work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel\nimbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean\nsquares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to\nestimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected\ntargets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior\nknowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in\ncombination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed\nmethod suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the\nnormal operation of the radar. Furthermore, it features reduced dependency on\nspecific targets of interest and faster update rates of the channel imbalance\nestimation compared to the majority of state-of-the-art methods. This\nimprovement is achieved by allowing for multiple targets in the angular\nspectrum, whereas most other methods are restricted to only single targets in\nthe angular spectrum.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG\nbiomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG\nin cross-subject settings.\n  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between\nelectromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics\nand the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel\nmultimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5fc3\u97f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u975e\u56e0\u679cLSTM\uff09\u5728\u91cd\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5fc3\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08ECG\uff09\u548c\u5fc3\u97f3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08PCG\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u91cd\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5fc3\u810f\u529f\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528EPHNOGRAM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u56e0\u679cLSTM\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5fc3\u7535\u548c\u5fc3\u97f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3001\u751f\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u975e\u56e0\u679cLSTM\uff09\u5728\u91cd\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u91cd\u6784\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u5305\u7edc\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8de8\u4e2a\u4f53\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e34\u5e8a\u5fc3\u7535\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982QT\u95f4\u671f\uff09\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u97f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u8de8\u4e2a\u4f53\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4e86\u5fc3\u7535\u548c\u5fc3\u97f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5fc3\u810f\u76d1\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Label supervision\nfurther enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment\nof unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth\nregions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement\nchallenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation\noccurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward\npass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the\nregularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we\nintroduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and\npromoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a\nduality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper\nefficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces\nsmoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,\nseamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal\nparameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.\nPreliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and\nlarge-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error\nto 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach\nto effectively address both challenges.

This paper presents a novel 6G radio network\nplanning framework that integrates Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with\nReconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to deliver ubiquitous coverage and\nenhanced network capacity. Our framework overcomes the limitations of\nconventional deployable base stations by leveraging NTN architectures,\nincluding Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and passive RIS platforms seamlessly\nintegrated with Beyond 5G (B5G) TNs. By incorporating advanced B5G technologies\nsuch as Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and beamforming, and by\noptimizing spectrum utilization across the C, S, and Ka bands, we implement a\nrigorous interference management strategy based on a dynamic SINR model.\nComprehensive calculations and simulations validate the proposed framework,\ndemonstrating significant improvements in connectivity, reliability, and\ncost-efficiency in crowded scenarios.
