### [1] [Spectral Efficiency Maximization for mmWave MIMO-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Under Practical Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04683)
*Jitendra Singh,Anand Mehrotra,Suraj Srivastava,Aditya K. Jagannatham,Lajos Hanzo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于毫米波MIMO集成感知与通信系统的混合发射预编码和接收组合设计方案，优化了频谱效率并满足雷达波束模式相似性等约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决毫米波MIMO ISAC系统中混合发射预编码和接收组合的设计问题，兼顾通信用户的频谱效率和雷达目标的识别需求。

Method: 采用顺序设计方法，先设计发射预编码，再设计接收组合器，并利用MM-based RCG方法和LMBC方案处理非凸约束和低复杂度需求。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的混合设计方案在性能上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在毫米波MIMO ISAC系统中具有优异性能，实现了通信和感知的双重优化。

Abstract: A hybrid transmit precoder (TPC) and receive combiner (RC) pair is conceived
for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The proposed design considers a
practical mean squared error (MSE) constraint between the desired and the
achieved beampatterns constructed for identifying radar targets (RTs). To
achieve optimal performance, we formulate an optimization problem relying on
sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization of the communication users (CUs),
while satisfying certain radar beampattern similarity (RBPS), total transmit
power, and constant modulus constraints, where the latter are attributed to the
hybrid mmWave MIMO architecture. Since the aforementioned problem is non-convex
and intractable, a sequential approach is proposed wherein the TPCs are
designed first, followed by the RCs. To deal with the non-convex MSE and
constant modulus constraints in the TPC design problem, we propose a
majorization and minimization (MM) based Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG)
method, which restricts the tolerable MSE of the beampattern to within a
predefined limit. Moreover, the least squares and the zero-forcing methods are
adopted for maximizing the sum-SE and for mitigating the multiuser interference
(MUI), respectively. Furthermore, to design the RC at each CU, we propose a
linear MM-based blind combiner (LMBC) scheme that does not rely on the
knowledge of the TPC at the CUs and has a low complexity. To achieve user
fairness, we further extend the proposed sequential approach for maximizing the
geometric mean (GM) of the CU's rate. Simulation results are presented, which
show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid TPC and RC in comparison
to the state-of-the-art designs in the mmWave MIMO ISAC systems under
consideration.

### [2] [Design of OTFS Signals with Pulse Shaping and Window Function for OTFS-Based Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04861)
*Liangchen Sun,Yutaka Jitsumatsu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种采用广义根升余弦窗的脉冲雷达系统，放宽了传统窗函数值在[0,1]的限制，允许负值和超过1的值，从而提升了信号设计的灵活性。结合正交时频空间信号和频域插值，显著提高了分数参数估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的窗函数限制了信号设计的灵活性，且对分数延迟和多普勒频移的捕捉能力有限。本文旨在通过广义窗函数和频域插值，提升雷达系统的性能。

Method: 采用广义根升余弦窗与矩形脉冲结合，生成高聚焦的模糊函数信号。同时，利用频域插值优化分数参数估计。

Result: 结果表明，所提出的系统在模糊函数中实现了高聚焦性，频域插值的参数估计准确性优于传统线性插值。

Conclusion: 广义窗函数和频域插值的结合为雷达系统提供了更高的灵活性和性能改进，尤其在分数参数估计方面表现突出。

Abstract: We propose a pulse radar system that employs a generalized window function
derived from the root raised cosine (RRC), which relaxes the conventional
constraint that the window values are within the range [0, 1]. The proposed
window allows both negative values and values exceeding 1, enabling greater
flexibility in signal design. The system transmits orthogonal time frequency
space (OTFS) signals intermittently, establishing a flexible input-output
relationship that captures both fractional delays and Doppler shifts. By
combining the generalized RRC window with a rectangular pulse, the resulting
pilot signal achieves a sharp concentration in the ambiguity function over both
the delay and Doppler domains. To enhance the estimation accuracy of fractional
parameters, we apply frequency-domain interpolation based on the
autocorrelation of the RRC window, which outperforms conventional linear
interpolation by preserving the signal structure more effectively.

Abstract: To leverage high-frequency bands in 6G wireless systems and beyond, employing
massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) arrays at the transmitter and/or
receiver side is crucial. To mitigate the power consumption and hardware
complexity across massive frequency bands and antenna arrays, a sacrifice in
the resolution of the data converters will be inevitable. In this paper, we
consider a point-to-point massive MIMO system with 1-bit digital-to-analog
converters at the transmitter, where the linearly precoded signal is
supplemented with dithering before the 1-bit quantization. For this system, we
propose a new maximumlikelihood (ML) data detection method at the receiver by
deriving the mean and covariance matrix of the received signal, where
symbol-dependent linear minimum mean squared error estimation is utilized to
efficiently linearize the transmitted signal. Numerical results show that the
proposed ML method can provide gains of more than two orders of magnitude in
terms of symbol error rate over conventional data detection based on soft
estimation.

Abstract: Flexible and intelligent antenna designs, such as pinching antenna systems
and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), have gained extensive research
attention due to their potential to enhance the wireless channels. This letter,
for the first time, presents a comparative study between the emerging pinching
antenna systems and RIS in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. Our results reveal
that RIS requires an extremely large number of elements (in the order of

### [6] [An SCMA Receiver for 6G NTN based on Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05111)
*Bruno De Filippo,Carla Amatetti,Riccardo Campana,Alessandro Guidotti,Alessandro Vanelli-Coralli*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 探讨AI技术在6G非地面网络（NTN）中SCMA接收器的应用，通过多任务学习模型优化信号分离，降低BLER并提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需整合地面与非地面网络，但SCMA的非正交特性导致干扰，传统接收器效果受限，需借助AI提升性能。

Method: 使用多任务学习训练AI模型，通过链路级仿真评估BLER和吞吐量性能。

Result: AI模型在目标BLER为10%时，比基准算法降低3.5dB的Eb/N0需求。

Conclusion: 尽管AI模型性能优越，但其在低轨卫星上的实现复杂度仍需解决。

Abstract: Future 6G networks are envisioned to enhance the user experience in a
multitude of different ways. The unification of existing terrestrial networks
with non-terrestrial network (NTN) components will provide users with
ubiquitous connectivity. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) will enable
low-latency services, with computations performed closer to the end users, and
distributed learning paradigms. Advanced multiple access schemes, such as
sparse code multiple access (SCMA), can be employed to efficiently move data
from edge nodes to spaceborne MEC servers. However, the non-orthogonal nature
of SCMA results in interference, limiting the effectiveness of traditional SCMA
receivers. Hence, NTN links should be protected with robust channel codes,
significantly reducing the uplink throughput. Thus, we investigate the
application of artificial intelligence (AI) to SCMA receivers for 6G NTNs. We
train an AI model with multi-task learning to optimally separate and receive
superimposed SCMA signals. Through link level simulations, we evaluate the
block error rate (BLER) and the aggregated theoretical throughput achieved by
the AI model as a function of the received energy per bit over noise power
spectral density ratio (Eb/N0). We show that the proposed receiver achieves a
target 10% BLER with 3.5dB lower Eb/N0 with respect to the benchmark algorithm.
We conclude the assessment discussing the complexity-related challenges to the
implementation of the AI model on board of a low earth orbit satellite.

Abstract: Wearable and implantable healthcare sensors are pivotal for real-time patient
monitoring but face critical challenges in power efficiency, data security, and
signal noise. This paper introduces a novel platform that leverages hardware
noise as a dual-purpose resource to enhance machine learning (ML) robustness
and secure data via Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). By integrating
noise-driven signal processing, PUFbased authentication, and ML-based anomaly
detection, our system achieves secure, low-power monitoring for devices like
ECG wearables. Simulations demonstrate that noise improves ML accuracy by 8%
(92% for detecting premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and atrial
fibrillation (AF)), while PUFs provide 98% uniqueness for tamper-resistant
security, all within a 50 uW power budget. This unified approach not only
addresses power, security, and noise challenges but also enables scalable,
intelligent sensing for telemedicine and IoT applications.

Conclusion: 提出了一种高效且可扩展的整数关联优化方法，优于现有分数关联方法。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models can effectively optimize a multi-cell wireless
network by designing the beamforming vectors and association decisions.
Existing ML designs, however, often needs to approximate the integer
association variables with a probability distribution output. We propose a
novel graph neural network (GNN) structure that jointly optimize beamforming
vectors and user association while guaranteeing association output as integers.
The integer association constraints are satisfied using the Gumbel-Softmax (GS)
reparameterization, without increasing computational complexity. Simulation
results demonstrate that our proposed GS-based GNN consistently achieves
integer association decisions and yields a higher sum-rate, especially when
generalized to larger networks, compared to all other fractional association
methods.

Abstract: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge

on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our
simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit
percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态信道分配的优化算法BAI-MCTS及其改进版LLM-BAI-MCTS，用于密集WiFi 7网络中的多链路操作，显著提升了收敛速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi 7的多链路操作（MLO）虽能提升吞吐量和降低延迟，但在密集网络中的动态信道分配问题尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 将问题建模为组合优化，并引入MAB框架进行在线学习；提出BAI-MCTS算法及整合大型语言模型的LLM-BAI-MCTS。

Result: BAI-MCTS的收敛速度比现有算法快50.44%，LLM-BAI-MCTS在密集网络中进一步提速63.32%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法有效解决了动态信道分配问题，为密集网络中的WiFi 7性能优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文评估了共享频谱模型（CBRS）在室内无线网络中的性能，展示了其在覆盖范围、吞吐量和性能上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内无线连接面临挑战，传统解决方案（如MNO和Wi-Fi）存在信号穿透差和可靠性问题，需要探索更优方案。

Method: 在大型零售商店中，对CBRS、MNO宏网络和Wi-Fi 6进行了现场性能比较。

Result: CBRS在覆盖范围、吞吐量和性能上优于MNO和Wi-Fi，且设备需求更少。

Conclusion: CBRS是室内无线网络的可行替代方案，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Indoor environments present a significant challenge for wireless
connectivity, as immense data demand strains traditional solutions. Public
Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), utilizing outdoor macro base stations (BSs),
suffer from poor signal penetration. Indoor Wi-Fi networks, on the other hand,
may face reliability issues due to spectrum contention. Shared spectrum models,
particularly the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) utilized by private
4G/5G networks, have emerged as a promising alternative to provide reliable
indoor service. Moreover, these private networks are equipped with the
neutral-host (NH) model, seamlessly offloading indoor MNOs' traffic to the
private CBRS network. This paper presents a comprehensive, in-situ performance
evaluation of three co-located technologies utilizing mid-bands spectrum (1-6
GHz)--a CBRS-based NH network, public MNO macro networks, and a Wi-Fi 6
network--within a large, big-box retail store characterized by significant
building loss. Our analysis demonstrates: (i) the NH network provides superior
indoor coverage compared to MNO macro, requiring only six CBRS devices
(CBSDs)--versus 65 Access Points (APs) for enterprise Wi-Fi--to achieve full
coverage, with a median building loss of 26.6 dB ensuring interference-free
coexistence with outdoor federal incumbents; (ii) the NH network achieves
substantial indoor throughput gains, with per-channel normalized throughput
improvements of 1.44x and 1.62x in downlink (DL), and 4.33x and 13x in uplink
(UL), compared to 4G and 5G macro deployments, respectively; (iii) the NH
deployment achieves a median indoor aggregated physical (PHY)-layer DL
throughput gain of 2.08x over 5G macro deployments indoors, despite utilizing
only 40 MHz of aggregated bandwidth compared to 225 MHz for 5G macro; and (iv)
the NH deployment also outperforms Wi-Fi in application-layer HTTP DL
performance by 5.05x.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线电地图在智能城市、物联网和无线网络规划中至关重要，但稀疏测量下的准确重建仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出MARS方法，结合CNNs和Transformers，利用多尺度特征融合和残差连接提取全局和局部特征。

Result: 实验表明MARS在MSE和SSIM上优于基线模型，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: MARS具有实际应用潜力，能有效提升无线电地图的重建精度。

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需神经网络的方法在穿墙雷达人体活动识别中仍具有潜力，且物理可解释性更强。

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的六维可移动极化天线（P-6DMA），通过动态调整天线极化和旋转，优化无线通信性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无线通信系统难以同时利用极化和空间多样性，P-6DMA通过电气和机械调整，为多用户系统提供高效的信道重构方案。

Method: 提出两阶段传输协议，先基于统计CSI优化基站天线旋转，再根据瞬时CSI设计极化向量。使用基于惩罚双分解的低复杂度算法联合设计极化和旋转。

Result: 仿真结果表明，P-6DMA在极化和旋转联合设计下，性能显著优于未调整的基准方案。

Conclusion: P-6DMA通过极化和空间多样性的联合利用，有效提升了无线通信系统的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel polarized six-dimensional movable antenna
(P-6DMA) to enhance the performance of wireless communication cost-effectively.
Specifically, the P-6DMA enables polarforming by adaptively tuning the
antenna's polarization electrically as well as controls the antenna's rotation
mechanically, thereby exploiting both polarization and spatial diversity to
reconfigure wireless channels for improving communication performance. First,
we model the P-6DMA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming
vectors and antenna rotations. We then propose a new two-timescale transmission
protocol to maximize the weighted sum-rate for a P-6DMA-enhanced multiuser
system. Specifically, antenna rotations at the base station (BS) are first
optimized based on the statistical channel state information (CSI) of all
users, which varies at a much slower rate compared to their instantaneous CSI.
Then, transceiver polarforming vectors are designed to cater to the
instantaneous CSI under the optimized BS antennas' rotations. Under the
polarforming phase shift and amplitude constraints, a new polarforming and
rotation joint design problem is efficiently addressed by a low-complexity
algorithm based on penalty dual decomposition, where the polarforming
coefficients are updated in parallel to reduce computational time. Simulation
results demonstrate the significant performance advantages of polarforming,
antenna rotation, and their joint design in comparison with various benchmarks
without polarforming or antenna rotation adaptation.

Abstract: We introduce a resource allocation framework for goal-oriented semantic

for agents whose preferences deviate from traditional expected utility theory
(EUT), specifically incorporating cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences.
We develop a comprehensive analytical framework that captures human-centric
aspects of decision-making and risky choices under uncertainty, such as risk
perception, loss aversion, and perceptual distortions in probability metrics.
By identifying essential modifications in traditional resource allocation
design principles required for agents with CPT preferences, we showcase the
framework's relevance through its application to the problem of power
allocation in multi-channel wireless communication systems.

Conclusion: 新算法框架在语义感知资源分配中表现优异。

Abstract: The problem of resource allocation in goal-oriented semantic communication
with semantic-aware utilities and subjective risk perception is studied here.
By linking information importance to risk aversion, we model agent behavior
using Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), which incorporates risk-sensitive
utility functions and nonlinear transformations of distributions, reflecting
subjective perceptions of gains and losses. The objective is to maximize the
aggregate utility across multiple CPT-modeled agents, which leads to a
nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problem. To efficiently solve this
challenging problem, we propose a new algorithmic framework that combines
successive convex approximation (SCA) with the projected subgradient method and
Lagrangian relaxation, Our approach enables tractable optimization while
preserving solution quality, offering both theoretical rigor and practical
effectiveness in semantics-aware resource allocation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Word2Vec启发，作者希望利用类似方法捕获CSI的空间关系，避免依赖CSI重构或真实位置信息。

Result: 实验证明CSI2Vec在减少计算和存储需求的同时，保持了优异的定位和信道图表绘制性能。

Conclusion: CSI2Vec提供了一种高效的CSI表示方法，适用于复杂无线环境下的下游任务。

Abstract: Natural language processing techniques, such as Word2Vec, have demonstrated
exceptional capabilities in capturing semantic and syntactic relationships of
text through vector embeddings. Inspired by this technique, we propose CSI2Vec,
a self-supervised framework for generating universal and robust channel state
information (CSI) representations tailored to CSI-based positioning (POS) and
channel charting (CC). CSI2Vec learns compact vector embeddings across various
wireless scenarios, capturing spatial relationships between user equipment
positions without relying on CSI reconstruction or ground-truth position
information. We implement CSI2Vec as a neural network that is trained across
various deployment setups (i.e., the spatial arrangement of radio equipment and
scatterers) and radio setups (RSs) (i.e., the specific hardware used), ensuring
robustness to aspects such as differences in the environment, the number of
used antennas, or allocated set of subcarriers. CSI2Vec abstracts the RS by
generating compact vector embeddings that capture essential spatial
information, avoiding the need for full CSI transmission or reconstruction
while also reducing complexity and improving processing efficiency of
downstream tasks. Simulations with ray-tracing and real-world CSI datasets
demonstrate CSI2Vec's effectiveness in maintaining excellent POS and CC
performance while reducing computational demands and storage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 采用基于RWG类元素的矩量法，结构化网格生成九种可电连接组件，构建多级块托普利兹矩阵，并通过内部求解器加速计算。

Result: 方法将内存需求从$\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$降至$\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$，展示了32x32阵列的远场和9x9阵列的散射参数计算。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了内存占用，提升了计算效率，适用于大规模阵列天线仿真。

Abstract: A large part of the geometry of array antennas is often partially defined by
finite translational symmetries. Applying the method of moments (MoM) with the
RWG-like element on an appropriately structured mesh to these arrays results in
an impedance matrix where the main part exhibits a multilevel block Toeplitz
structure. This article introduces a memory-efficient construction method that
effectively represents and reuses impedance calculations. The proposed method,
applicable to electrically connected elements, also accounts for all
non-symmetric parts of the array. The core idea involves nine distinct
electrically connectable components from which the array can be assembled. The
derived multilevel block Toeplitz matrix is further utilized by an in-house
inverse solver to achieve faster and more memory-efficient MoM current vector
calculations. We demonstrate the method by computing the far-field of a 32x32
array and the scattering parameters of two tightly coupled 9x9 arrays. This
approach reduces the memory allocation from $\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$, for an $N_x \times N_y$ array.

TL;DR: 提出了用于稳定监测面部温度变化的同步热成像方法，提高了温度分辨率，并成功测量了与心率变异性相关的微小温度变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外热成像技术因其非接触测量特性在血流监测中受到关注，但面部和颈部等深层血管区域缺乏标准化方法，且外部刺激可能有害。

Method: 采用同步热成像技术对实验对象的面部温度变化进行监测，测量了额头和下巴的微小温度变化（约10 mK）。

Result: 该方法将温度分辨率提高2倍以上，并能稳定测量由血流引起的皮肤温度变化。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于生理监测，如血流变化或压力指示器。

Abstract: Infrared thermography has gained interest as a tool for non-contact
measurement of blood circulation and skin blood flow due to cardiac activity.
Partiularly, blood vessels on the surface, such as on the back of the hand, are
suited for visualization. However, standardized methodologies have not yet been
established for areas such as the face and neck, where many blood vessels are
lie deeper beneath the surface, and external stimulation for measurement could
be harmful. Here we propose Synchro-Thermography for stable monitoring of
facial temperature changes associated with heart rate variability. We conducted
experiments with eight subjects and measured minute temperature changes with an
amplitude of about \SI{10}{mK} on the forehead and chin. The proposed method
improves the temperature resolution by a factor of 2 or more, and can stably
measure skin temperature changes caused by blood flow. This skin temperature
change could be applied to physiological sensing such as blood flow changes due
to injury or disease, or as an indicator of stress.
