Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0, precise indoor localization is vital for
automation and efficiency in smart factories. Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surfaces (RIS) are emerging as key enablers in 6G networks for joint sensing
and communication. However, RIS faces significant challenges in
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and multipath propagation, particularly in
localization scenarios, where detecting NLOS conditions is crucial for ensuring
not only reliable results and increased connectivity but also the safety of
smart factory personnel. This study introduces an AI-assisted framework
employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) customized for accurate
Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) classification to enhance
RIS-based localization using measured, synthetic, mixed-measured, and
mixed-synthetic experimental data, that is, original, augmented, slightly
noisy, and highly noisy data, respectively. Validated through such data from
three different environments, the proposed customized-CNN (cCNN) model achieves
{95.0\%-99.0\%} accuracy, outperforming standard pre-trained models like Visual
Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16) with an accuracy of {85.5\%-88.0\%}. By addressing
RIS limitations in NLOS scenarios, this framework offers scalable and
high-precision localization solutions for 6G-enabled smart factories.

### [2] [Application of Quaternions to Obtain Analytic Solutions to Systems of Polarization Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15999)
*Michael G. Taylor*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文展示了如何用四元数替代Jones向量和Jones矩阵来描述光束通过波片系统，提供了更简便的数学操作方式，并展示了四元数与多种偏振描述之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Jones向量和矩阵方法在描述光束通过波片系统时复杂且难以逆操作，论文旨在展示四元数的简便性和有效性。

Method: 通过四元数表示光学信号和波片组件，并结合Poincaré球和偏振椭圆的描述，提出四元数的对数-指数关系及部分共轭等数学工具。

Result: 证明了四元数方法在光学信号描述和操作中的优势，并通过实例展示了如何用三个可旋转波片构建无限相位调节器。

Conclusion: 四元数方法为光学信号处理提供了更简洁和灵活的数学框架，解决了传统方法难以处理的问题。

Abstract: The usual way to describe mathematically a beam of coherent light passing
through a system of waveplates is via the Jones vector and Jones matrix. This
paper will show that a quaternion can be used to represent both the optical
signal and the waveplate component it passes through, replacing the Jones
vector and the Jones matrix. The quaternion description is easier to manipulate
than the matrix-vector description; for example it can be inverted. As well as
the Jones vector, the state of polarization (SOP) of an optical signal is often
described as a three-dimensional vector on the Poincar\'e sphere, or as a
polarization ellipse, and it will be shown how these three forms are closely
related to the quaternion representation. Similarly, the action of a waveplate
may be represented as a rotation about an axis on the Poincar\'e sphere, and
that rotation is shown to have a logarithm-exponential relationship to the
waveplate's quaternion. The paper presents rules to decide if two optical
signals are aligned or orthogonal in phase or in polarization from their
quaternions, and presents the quaternion operations to change the phase or
change the SOP. Light passing through a system of waveplates is written as a
product of quaternions, and it can be hard to simplify or manipulate that
expression because quaternion multiplication does not commute. The paper brings
together several mathematical tools that allow such a quaternion product to be
rearranged, including the new idea of partial conjugation. Finally, a worked
example is included of the quaternion mathematics applied to a waveplate
problem that has not been solved before. It is shown that an endless optical
phase shifter can be built using three rotatable waveplates, and equations for
the angles of rotation are derived to produce the desired phase shift for given
input and output SOPs.

### [3] [Beamforming-Codebook-Aware Channel Knowledge Map Construction for Multi-Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16132)
*Haohan Wang,Xu Shi,Hengyu Zhang,Yashuai Cao,Jintao Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于TransUNet的框架，用于构建通道知识图（CKM），通过结合UNet和Transformer模块，提高了MIMO系统中波束成形的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CKM构建方法计算量大，现有研究多关注单天线系统，无法满足MIMO配置的波束成形需求。

Method: 采用TransUNet框架，结合UNet的多尺度特征提取和Transformer的全局依赖捕捉，并引入DFT预编码向量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有深度学习方法，RMSE提升17%。

Conclusion: 提出的TransUNet框架为MIMO系统中的CKM构建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) has emerged as a crucial technology for
next-generation communication, enabling the construction of high-fidelity
mappings between spatial environments and channel parameters via
electromagnetic information analysis. Traditional CKM construction methods like
ray tracing are computationally intensive. Recent studies utilizing neural
networks (NNs) have achieved efficient CKM generation with reduced
computational complexity and real-time processing capabilities. Nevertheless,
existing research predominantly focuses on single-antenna systems, failing to
address the beamforming requirements inherent to MIMO configurations. Given
that appropriate precoding vector selection in MIMO systems can substantially
enhance user communication rates, this paper presents a TransUNet-based
framework for constructing CKM, which effectively incorporates discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) precoding vectors. The proposed architecture combines a UNet
backbone for multiscale feature extraction with a Transformer module to capture
global dependencies among encoded linear vectors. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning (DL) approaches, yielding a 17\% improvement in RMSE compared to
RadioWNet. The code is publicly accessible at

### [4] [Synthesis of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Waveforms using a Hybrid Generative Model and a Lung Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16462)
*Sagar Deep Deb,Suvakash Dey,Deepak K. Agrawal*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合数学模型和深度生成模型的方法，用于生成合成的、临床相关的VD波形数据，以提高VD检测算法的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模、标注良好的VD波形数据集，现有的机器学习模型在VD检测中准确性有限。手动检测方法不可靠且耗时。

Method: 提出VDLV数学模型来模拟VD波形的临床变形，并利用GAN和cGAN进一步多样化生成的数据集。

Result: 混合方法生成的合成VD波形具有现实性和多样性，cGAN模型能生成更精确的VD信号。

Conclusion: 这种合成波形数据集有望显著提升VD检测算法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) is often described as a mismatch between a
patient breathing effort and the ventilator support during mechanical
ventilation. This mismatch is often associated with an increased risk of lung
injury and longer hospital stays. The manual VD detection method is unreliable
and requires considerable effort from medical professionals. Automating this
process requires a computational pipeline that can identify VD breaths from
continuous waveform signals. For that, while various machine learning (ML)
models have been proposed, their accuracy is often limited due to the
unavailability of a large, well-annotated VD waveform dataset. This paper
presents a new approach combining mathematical and deep generative models to
generate synthetic, clinically relevant VD waveforms. The mathematical model,
which we call the VD lung ventilator model (VDLV), can accurately replicate
clinically observable deformation in the pressure and volume waveforms. These
temporal deformations are hypothesized to be related to specific VD breaths. We
leverage the VDLV model to produce training waveform datasets covering normal
and various VD breaths. These datasets are further diversified using deep
learning models such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Conditional
GAN (cGAN). The performance of both GAN and cGAN models is assessed through
quantitative metrics, demonstrating that this hybrid approach effectively
creates realistic and diverse VD waveforms. Notably, the pressure and volume
cGAN models enable the generation of more precise and targeted VD signals.
These improved synthetic waveform datasets have the potential to significantly
enhance the accuracy and robustness of VD detection algorithms.

### [5] [A Tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling, Architectures, System Design and Optimization, and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16504)

Conclusion: BD-RIS是一个颠覆性技术，为智能表面的设计和应用开辟了新的可能性，未来将在多个领域发挥重要作用。

Abstract: Written by its inventors, this first tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BD-RISs) provides the readers with the
basics and fundamental tools necessary to appreciate, understand, and
contribute to this emerging and disruptive technology. Conventional (Diagonal)
RISs (D-RISs) are characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix
$\mathbf{\Theta}$ such that the wave manipulation flexibility of D-RIS is
extremely limited. In contrast, BD-RIS refers to a novel and general framework
for RIS where its scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal (hence, the
``beyond-diagonal'' terminology) and consequently, all entries of
$\mathbf{\Theta}$ can potentially help shaping waves for much higher
manipulation flexibility. This physically means that BD-RIS can artificially
engineer and reconfigure coupling across elements of the surface thanks to
inter-element reconfigurable components which allow waves absorbed by one
element to flow through other elements. Consequently, BD-RIS opens the door to
more general and versatile intelligent surfaces that subsumes existing RIS
architectures as special cases. In this tutorial, we share all the secret sauce
to model, design, and optimize BD-RIS and make BD-RIS transformative in many
different applications. Topics discussed include physics-consistent and
multi-port network-aided modeling; transmitting, reflecting, hybrid, and
multi-sector mode analysis; reciprocal and non-reciprocal architecture designs
and optimal performance-complexity Pareto frontier of BD-RIS; signal
processing, optimization, and channel estimation for BD-RIS; hardware
impairments (discrete-value impedance and admittance, lossy interconnections
and components, wideband effects, mutual coupling) of BD-RIS; benefits and
applications of BD-RIS in communications, sensing, power transfer.

Abstract: This paper investigates a discrete energy state transition model for energy
harvesting (EH) in cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO)
networks. A Markov chain-based stochastic process is conceived to characterize
the temporal evolution of the user equipment (UE) energy level by leveraging
state transition probabilities (STP) based on the energy differential ($\Delta
E$) between the EH and consumed energy within each coherence interval.
Tractable mathematical relationships are derived for the STP cases using a new
stochastic model of non-linear EH, approximated using a Gamma distribution.
This derivation leverages closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of
the harvested energy. To improve the positive STP of the minimum energy UE
among all network UEs, we aim to maximize the $\Delta E$ for this UE using two
power allocation (PA) schemes. The first scheme is a heuristic PA using the
relative channel characteristics to this UE from all access points (APs). The
second scheme is the optimized PA based on the solution of a second-order conic
problem to maximize the $\Delta E$ using a responsive primal-dual interior
point method (PD-IPM) algorithm with modified backtracking line-search,
iterating over multiple PA periods. Our simulation results illustrate that both
the proposed PA schemes enhance the dynamic minimum UE energy level by around
four-fold over full power control, along with the performance improvement
attributed to spatial resource diversification of CF-mMIMO systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于专用chirp信号的Chirp-DMA方案，用于毫米波雷达的集成感知与通信（ISAC），解决现有系统中通信功能不足的问题，并通过两种调制方案（TDM和DDM）优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达在自动驾驶中发挥着关键作用，但现有系统缺乏集成的通信功能，限制了其进一步发展。因此，需要设计一种方案，既能实现高精度的感知，又能支持高效的通信。

Method: 设计了专用chirp信号以识别空闲时频资源，提出Chirp-DMA方案实现多对毫米波雷达收发器的无干扰ISAC。基于TDM和DDM雷达方案，提出了两种调制方案，分别针对高通信速率和低信噪比环境。

Result: 通过仿真验证了基于DDM的调制方案的有效性，展示了其在不同场景下的性能优势。

Conclusion: 论文提出的Chirp-DMA和调制方案为解决毫米波雷达ISAC问题提供了有效方法，但仍有一些挑战需要进一步研究以优化V2X环境下的自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is reshaping the way humans travel, with millimeter wave
(mmWave) radar playing a crucial role in this transformation to enabe
vehicle-to-everything (V2X). Although chirp is widely used in mmWave radar
systems for its strong sensing capabilities, the lack of integrated
communication functions in existing systems may limit further advancement of
autonomous driving. In light of this, we first design ``dedicated chirps"
tailored for sensing chirp signals in the environment, facilitating the
identification of idle time-frequency resources. Based on these dedicated
chirps, we propose a chirp-division multiple access (Chirp-DMA) scheme,
enabling multiple pairs of mmWave radar transceivers to perform integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) without interference. Subsequently, we propose
two chirp-based delay-Doppler domain modulation schemes that enable each pair
of mmWave radar transceivers to simultaneously sense and communicate within
their respective time-frequency resource blocks. The modulation schemes are
based on different multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar schemes: the
time division multiplexing (TDM)-based scheme offers higher communication
rates, while the Doppler division multiplexing (DDM)-based scheme is suitable
for working in a lower signal-to-noise ratio range. We then validate the
effectiveness of the proposed DDM-based scheme through simulations. Finally, we
present some challenges and issues that need to be addressed to advance ISAC in
V2X for better autonomous driving. Simulation codes are provided to reproduce

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为OWP-IMU的开源数据集，用于测试和分析基于RSS的光学无线定位系统，结合IMU数据提升定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏开源数据集来测试基于RSS的光学无线定位系统，作者收集了多模态数据以支持进一步研究。

Method: 在两个不同室内环境中收集RSS、IMU和真实轨迹数据，覆盖不同速度和障碍场景。

Result: 数据集包含超过11万个数据点，通过结合IMU数据使用扩展卡尔曼滤波器提高了定位精度。

Conclusion: OWP-IMU数据集的发布将促进室内定位方法的进一步研究。

Abstract: Received signal strength (RSS)-based optical wireless positioning (OWP)
systems are becoming popular for indoor localization because they are low-cost
and accurate. However, few open-source datasets are available to test and
analyze RSS-based OWP systems. In this paper, we collected RSS values at a
sampling frequency of 27 Hz, inertial measurement unit (IMU) at a sampling
frequency of 200 Hz and the ground truth at a sampling frequency of 160 Hz in
two indoor environments. One environment has no obstacles, and the other has a
metal column as an obstacle to represent a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario.
We recorded data with a vehicle at three different speeds (low, medium and
high). The dataset includes over 110 k data points and covers more than 80 min.
We also provide benchmark tests to show localization performance using only
RSS-based OWP and improve accuracy by combining IMU data via extended kalman
filter. The dataset OWP-IMU is open source1 to support further research on
indoor localization methods.

### [9] [Refining Neural Activation Patterns for Layer-Level Concept Discovery in Neural Network-Based Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15570)
*Marko Tuononen,Duy Vu,Dani Korpi,Vesa Starck,Ville Hautamäki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了改进的Neural Activation Pattern (NAP)方法，通过聚类全层激活分布来发现神经网络中的层级别概念，并在视觉对象识别和无线电接收机模型中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念发现方法通常关注单个神经元或人类可解释特征，忽视了分布式的层级别模式。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 改进的NAP方法包括归一化、分布估计、距离度量和多样化的聚类选择，应用于视觉对象识别和无线电接收机模型。

Result: 在无线电接收机模型中，未发现离散概念，而是观察到由信噪比(SNR)塑造的连续激活流形，验证了SNR作为关键学习因素的物理合理性。改进的NAP增强了分布内外分离效果。

Conclusion: 聚类设计和激活流形对解释和调试神经网络行为至关重要，改进的NAP方法展现了更好的泛化能力和聚类质量验证。

Abstract: Concept discovery in neural networks often targets individual neurons or
human-interpretable features, overlooking distributed layer-wide patterns. We
study the Neural Activation Pattern (NAP) methodology, which clusters
full-layer activation distributions to identify such layer-level concepts.
Applied to visual object recognition and radio receiver models, we propose
improved normalization, distribution estimation, distance metrics, and varied
cluster selection. In the radio receiver model, distinct concepts did not
emerge; instead, a continuous activation manifold shaped by Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR) was observed -- highlighting SNR as a key learned factor,
consistent with classical receiver behavior and supporting physical
plausibility. Our enhancements to NAP improved in-distribution vs.
out-of-distribution separation, suggesting better generalization and indirectly
validating clustering quality. These results underscore the importance of
clustering design and activation manifolds in interpreting and troubleshooting
neural network behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CP-GAMP是一种可扩展的贝叶斯CPD算法，通过避免矩阵求逆和联合推断张量秩与噪声功率，显著减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贝叶斯CPD方法在大规模张量上计算效率低下，存在高维矩阵求逆问题，需要一种更高效的算法。

Method: 采用广义近似消息传递(GAMP)避免矩阵求逆，并结合期望最大化(EM)联合推断张量秩和噪声功率。

Result: 在100x100x100秩20的张量上，仅观测20%元素，CP-GAMP比现有方法减少82.7%运行时间，重建精度相当。

Conclusion: CP-GAMP在保持精度的前提下显著提升了计算效率，适用于大规模张量分解。

Abstract: Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) is a fundamental model for
tensor reconstruction. Although the Bayesian framework allows for principled
uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning, existing
methods do not scale well for large tensors because of high-dimensional matrix
inversions. To this end, we introduce CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian CPD
algorithm. This algorithm leverages generalized approximate message passing
(GAMP) to avoid matrix inversions and incorporates an expectation-maximization
routine to jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Through multiple
experiments, for synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with only 20% elements
observed, the proposed algorithm reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to the
state-of-the-art variational Bayesian CPD method, while maintaining comparable
reconstruction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足实时远程操作和高速移动宽带的需求，解决5G网络中资源分配和延迟控制的挑战。

Method: 采用基于强化学习的分层优化框架，结合拉格朗日函数优化资源分配，并利用actor-critic网络平衡目标。

Result: 分层方法优化了通信和控制性能，提升了资源利用效率和系统响应能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在5G网络中实现了高效的资源分配与机器人控制的稳定性。

Abstract: The evolution of 5G wireless technology has revolutionized connectivity,
enabling a diverse range of applications. Among these are critical use cases
such as real time teleoperation, which demands ultra reliable low latency
communications (URLLC) to ensure precise and uninterrupted control, and
enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services, which cater to data-intensive
applications requiring high throughput and bandwidth. In our scenario, there
are two queues, one for eMBB users and one for URLLC users. In teleoperation
tasks, control commands are received in the URLLC queue, where communication
delays occur. The dynamic index (DI) controls the service rate, affecting the
telerobotic (URLLC) queue. A separate queue models eMBB data traffic. Both
queues are managed through network slicing and application delay constraints,
leading to a unified Lagrangian-based Lyapunov optimization for efficient
resource allocation. We propose a DRL based hierarchical optimization framework
that consists of two levels. At the first level, network optimization
dynamically allocates resources for eMBB and URLLC users using a Lagrangian
functional and an actor critic network to balance competing objectives. At the
second level, control optimization finetunes the best gains for robots,
ensuring stability and responsiveness in network conditions. This hierarchical
approach enhances both communication and control processes, ensuring efficient
resource utilization and optimized performance across the network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决6G网络中实际部署AI模型面临的挑战，特别是协议理解与标准兼容问题。

Method: 使用参数高效的低秩适应（LoRA）方法微调解码器Transformer模型，将RRC消息线性化并保留ASN.1语法结构。

Result: 在3万条现场测试数据中，模型生成的RRC消息与真实消息的中位余弦相似度达0.97，优于零样本基准模型61%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合RAN特定推理的LAMs可直接协调控制平面程序，为AI原生空口范式奠定了基础。

Abstract: Integrating large AI models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks promises to
redefine protocol design and control-plane intelligence by enabling autonomous,
cognitive network operations. While industry concepts, such as ETSI's
Experiential Networked Intelligence (ENI), envision LAM-driven agents for
adaptive network slicing and intent-based management, practical implementations
still face challenges in protocol literacy and real-world deployment. This
paper presents an end-to-end demonstration of a LAM that generates
standards-compliant, ASN.1-encoded Radio Resource Control (RRC) messages as
part of control-plane procedures inside a gNB. We treat RRC messaging as a
domain-specific language and fine-tune a decoder-only transformer model (LLaMA
class) using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on RRC messages
linearized to retain their ASN.1 syntactic structure before standard byte-pair
encoding tokenization. This enables combinatorial generalization over RRC
protocol states while minimizing training overhead. On 30k field-test
request-response pairs, our 8 B model achieves a median cosine similarity of
0.97 with ground-truth messages on an edge GPU -- a 61 % relative gain over a
zero-shot LLaMA-3 8B baseline -- indicating substantially improved structural
and semantic RRC fidelity. Overall, our results show that LAMs, when augmented
with Radio Access Network (RAN)-specific reasoning, can directly orchestrate
control-plane procedures, representing a stepping stone toward the AI-native
air-interface paradigm. Beyond RRC emulation, this work lays the groundwork for
future AI-native wireless standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维数据中，样本协方差矩阵（SCM）可能因样本不足而无法计算，需要正则化方法。研究旨在找到最优估计器来最小化损失。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在样本不足时有效估计协方差矩阵，性能优于现有方法，且对矩阵条件数和谱形状有适应性。

Abstract: We consider estimating the population covariance matrix when the number of
available samples is less than the size of the observations. The sample
covariance matrix (SCM) being singular, regularization is mandatory in this
case. For this purpose we consider minimizing Stein's loss function and we
investigate a method based on augmenting the partial Cholesky decomposition of
the SCM. We first derive the finite sample optimum estimator which minimizes
the loss for each data realization, then the Oracle estimator which minimizes
the risk, i.e., the average value of the loss. Finally a practical scheme is
presented where the missing part of the Cholesky decomposition is filled. We
conduct a numerical performance study of the proposed method and compare it
with available related methods. In particular we investigate the influence of
the condition number of the covariance matrix as well as of the shape of its
spectrum.

Abstract: Advancements in AI-driven speech-based applications have transformed diverse
industries ranging from healthcare to customer service. However, the increasing
prevalence of non-native accented speech in global interactions poses
significant challenges for speech-processing systems, which are often trained
on datasets dominated by native speech. This study investigates accented
English speech through articulatory and acoustic analysis, identifying simpler
coordination patterns and higher average pitch than native speech. Using
eigenspectra and Vocal Tract Variable-based coordination features, we establish
an efficient method for quantifying accent strength without relying on
resource-intensive phonetic transcriptions. Our findings provide a new avenue
for research on the impacts of accents on speech intelligibility and offer
insights for developing inclusive, robust speech processing systems that
accommodate diverse linguistic communities.

Abstract: Studies on schizophrenia assessments using deep learning typically treat it
as a classification task to detect the presence or absence of the disorder,
oversimplifying the condition and reducing its clinical applicability. This
traditional approach overlooks the complexity of schizophrenia, limiting its
practical value in healthcare settings. This study shifts the focus to
individual symptom severity estimation using a multimodal approach that
integrates speech, video, and text inputs. We develop unimodal models for each
modality and a multimodal framework to improve accuracy and robustness. By
capturing a more detailed symptom profile, this approach can help in enhancing
diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment, offering a scalable
and objective tool for mental health assessment.

Motivation: 6DMA技术通过动态调整天线位置和旋转来提高无线网络容量，但需要高效的统计CSI获取方法。本文旨在通过利用6DMA信道的方向稀疏性，解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于协方差的算法，利用6DMA信道的方向稀疏性，仅在小部分位置和旋转上估计平均信道功率，并通过多径平均功率和DOA向量重构所有可能的位置和旋转的信道功率。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该算法在减少导频开销的同时，实现了比现有基准方案更高的信道功率估计精度。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方向稀疏性算法为6DMA系统的统计CSI获取提供了高效且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an innovative and transformative
technology to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting the 3D positions
and 3D rotations of antennas/surfaces (sub-arrays) based on the channel spatial
distribution. For optimization of the antenna positions and rotations, the
acquisition of statistical channel state information (CSI) is essential for
6DMA systems. In this paper, we unveil for the first time a new
\textbf{\textit{directional sparsity}} property of the 6DMA channels between
the base station (BS) and the distributed users, where each user has
significant channel gains only with a (small) subset of 6DMA position-rotation
pairs, which can receive direct/reflected signals from the user. By exploiting
this property, a covariance-based algorithm is proposed for estimating the
statistical CSI in terms of the average channel power at a small number of 6DMA
positions and rotations. Based on such limited channel power estimation, the
average channel powers for all possible 6DMA positions and rotations in the BS
movement region are reconstructed by further estimating the multi-path average
power and direction-of-arrival (DOA) vectors of all users. Simulation results
show that the proposed directional sparsity-based algorithm can achieve higher
channel power estimation accuracy than existing benchmark schemes, while
requiring a lower pilot overhead.

Abstract: Beyond diagonal intelligent reflecting surface (BD-IRS) is a new promising
IRS architecture for which the reflection matrix is not limited to the diagonal
structure as for conventional IRS. In this paper, we study a BD-IRS aided
uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where sensing is
performed in a device-based manner. Specifically, we aim to estimate the
unknown and random location of an active target based on its uplink probing
signals sent to a multi-antenna base station (BS) as well as the known prior
distribution information of the target's location. Multiple communication users
also simultaneously send uplink signals, resulting in a challenging mutual
interference issue between sensing and communication. We first characterize the
sensing performance metric by deriving the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB)
of the mean-squared error (MSE) when prior information is available. Then, we
formulate a BD-IRS reflection matrix optimization problem to maximize the
minimum expected achievable rate among the multiple users subject to a
constraint on the PCRB as well as the lossless and reciprocal constraints on
the BD-IRS reflection matrix. The formulated problem is non-convex and
challenging to solve. To tackle this problem, we propose a penalty dual
decomposition (PDD) based algorithm which can find a high-quality suboptimal
solution with polynomial-time complexity. In addition, we propose and optimize
a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based scheme which removes the
sensing-communication mutual interference. Numerical results verify the
effectiveness of the proposed designs and provide useful design insights.

Abstract: This paper studies a networked sensing system with multiple base stations
(BSs), which collaboratively sense the unknown and random three-dimensional
(3D) location of a target based on the target-reflected echo signals received
at the BSs. Considering a practical scenario where the target location
distribution is known a priori for exploitation, we aim to design the placement
of the multiple BSs to optimize the networked sensing performance. Firstly, we
characterize the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error
(MSE) in sensing the target's 3D location. Despite its complex form under
networked sensing, we derive its closed-form expression in terms of the BS
locations. Next, we formulate the BS placement optimization problem to minimize
the sensing PCRB, which is non-convex and difficult to solve. By leveraging a
series of equivalent transformations and the iterative inner approximation
method, we devise an algorithm with polynomial-time complexity which is
guaranteed to converge to a solution satisfying the Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT)
conditions of the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed placement
design significantly outperforms various benchmark designs.

Abstract: The emerging demands of sixth-generation wireless networks, such as
ultra-connectivity, native intelligence, and cross-domain convergence, are
bringing renewed focus to cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA)
as a fundamental enabler of scalable, efficient, and intelligent communication

protocol-level synergies, architectural models, and deployment strategies
across these technologies. Beyond integration, this article emphasizes the
orchestration of C-NOMA across future application domains such as digital
twins, extended reality, and e-health. In addition, it provides an extensive
and in-depth review of recent literature, categorized by relaying schemes,
system models, performance metrics, and optimization paradigms, including
model-based, heuristic, and AI-driven approaches. Finally, open challenges and
future research directions are outlined, spanning standardization, security,
and cross-layer design, positioning C-NOMA as a key pillar of intelligent
next-generation network architectures.

Abstract: Due to the recent increase in the number of connected devices, the need to
promptly detect security issues is emerging. Moreover, the high number of
communication flows creates the necessity of processing huge amounts of data.
Furthermore, the connected devices are heterogeneous in nature, having
different computational capacities. For this reason, in this work we propose an
image-based representation of network traffic which allows to realize a compact
summary of the current network conditions with 1-second time windows. The
proposed representation highlights the presence of anomalies thus reducing the
need for complex processing architectures. Finally, we present an unsupervised
learning approach which effectively detects the presence of anomalies. The code

Conclusion: 该方法为EA末端执行器提供了低成本、非接触且支持多对象监控的解决方案。

Abstract: Electrostatic adhesion is widely used in mobile robotics, haptics, and
robotic end effectors for its adaptability to diverse substrates and low energy
consumption. Force sensing is important for feedback control, interaction, and
monitoring in the EA system. However, EA force monitoring often relies on bulky
and expensive sensors, increasing the complexity and weight of the entire
system. This paper presents an acoustic-pressure-based method to monitor EA
forces without contacting the adhesion pad. When the EA pad is driven by a
bipolar square-wave voltage to adhere a conductive object, periodic acoustic
pulses arise from the EA system. We employed a microphone to capture these
acoustic pressure signals and investigate the influence of peak pressure
values. Results show that the peak value of acoustic pressure increased with
the mass and contact area of the adhered object, as well as with the amplitude
and frequency of the driving voltage. We applied this technique to mass
estimation of various objects and simultaneous monitoring of two EA systems.
Then, we integrated this technique into an EA end effector that enables
monitoring the change of adhered object mass during transport. The proposed
technique offers a low-cost, non-contact, and multi-object monitoring solution
for EA end effectors in handling tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for jointly calibrating magnetometers and
inertial measurement units, focusing on improving calibration accuracy and
computational efficiency. The proposed method formulates the calibration
problem as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem, treating both the
calibration parameters and orientation trajectory of the sensors as unknowns.
This formulation enables efficient optimization with closed-form derivatives.
The method is compared against two state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
computational complexity and estimation accuracy. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower root mean square error in
calibration parameters while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.
Further validation through real-world experiments confirms the practical
benefits of our approach: it effectively reduces position drift in a magnetic
field-aided inertial navigation system by more than a factor of two on most
datasets. Moreover, the proposed method calibrated 30 magnetometers in less
than 2 minutes. The contributions include a new calibration method, an analysis
of existing methods, and a comprehensive empirical evaluation. Datasets and
algorithms are made publicly available to promote reproducible research.

Conclusion: 该方法可提升AI分类器的特征工程，为机器学习算法提供更全面的信号特征。

Abstract: One of the most popular and innovative methods to analyse signals is by using
Ordinal Patterns (OPs). The OP encoding is based on transforming a (univariate)
signal into a symbolic sequence of OPs, where each OP represents the number of
permutations needed to order a small subset of the signal's magnitudes. This
implies that OPs are conceptually clear, methodologically simple to implement,
robust to noise, and can be applied to short signals. Moreover, they simplify
the statistical analyses that can be carried out on a signal, such as entropy
and complexity quantifications. However, because of the relative ordering,
information about the magnitude of the signal at each timestamp is lost -- this
being one of the major drawbacks in the method. Here, we propose a way to use
the signal magnitudes discarded in the OP encoding as a complementary variable
to its permutation entropy. To illustrate our approach, we analyse synthetic
trajectories from logistic and H{\'e}non maps -- with and without added noise
-- and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from rats in different
sleep-wake states. Our results show that, when complementing the permutation
entropy with the variability in the signal magnitudes, the characterisation of
the dynamical behaviours of the maps and the sleep-wake states is improved.
This implies that our approach can be useful for feature engineering and
improving AI classifiers, where typical machine learning algorithms need
complementary signal features as inputs to improve classification accuracy.
