### [1] [Experimental Demonstration of Robust Distributed Wireless Clock Synchronization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25277)
*Kumar Sai Bondada,Hiten Kothari,Yibin Liang,Daniel J. Jakubisin,R. Michael Buehrer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种频率跳变的双音波形方法，用于分布式无线时钟同步，以抵抗有意和无意的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式无线时钟同步对联合传输和接收技术至关重要，但现有方法易受干扰影响。

Conclusion: 频率跳变的双音波形是一种高效的分布式时钟同步解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed wireless clock synchronization is essential for aligning the
clocks of distributed transceivers in support of joint transmission and
reception techniques. One recently explored method involves synchronizing
distributed transceivers using a two-tone waveform, where the tones are
separated in frequency by a clock (frequency) reference signal. Prior research
has demonstrated frequency accuracy better than 1 Hz; however, this approach
remains vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional interference. In this
demonstration, we present a robust, frequency-hopped two-tone waveform that
enables transceivers to extract the reference signal without prior knowledge of
the exact frequency at which the tones are transmitted.

Abstract: This paper develops a graph-based hybrid beamforming framework for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cell-free integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) networks. Specifically, we construct a novel MIMO
cell-free ISAC network model. In this model, multiple dual-function base
station (BS) transmitters employ distributed hybrid beamforming to enable
simultaneous communication and sensing, while maintaining physical separation
between the transmitters and the radar receiver. Building on this model, we
formulate a multi-objective optimization problem under a power constraint to
jointly improve communication and sensing performance. To solve it, the problem
is first reformulated as a single-objective optimization problem. Then, a
graph-based method composed of multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) is
developed to realize hybrid beamforming with either perfect or imperfect
channel state information. Once trained, the neural network model can be
deployed distributively across BSs, enabling fast and efficient inference. To
further reduce inference latency, a custom field-programmable gate array
(FPGA)-based accelerator is developed. Numerical simulations validate the
communication and sensing capabilities of the proposed optimization approach,
while experimental evaluations demonstrate remarkable performance gains of
FPGA-based acceleration in GNN inference.

Abstract: We present the first-of-a-kind closed-loop $2\times4$ MIMO implementation for
the downlink of 5G Open RAN using OpenAirInterface (OAI), which is capable of
transmitting up to two transmission layers. Our implementation is a fully
functional 5G New Radio (5G NR) system, including the 5G Core Network (5G CN),
5G Radio Access Network (5G RAN), as well as 5G NR User Equipment (UEs). This
serves as a foundational framework for further advancements in the context of

the enhanced Channel State Information (CSI) reporting procedure at the UE,
which includes Rank Indicator (RI), Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI), and
Channel Quality Indicator (CQI). It is adjusted for the extended configuration
to maximize data rates. To demonstrate the performance of our implementation,
we measure the downlink data rates using $\textit{iperf3}$ in two scenarios:
(i) fixed channels to assess two-layer data transmission and (ii)
$\textit{Rice1}$ channels for general transmission analysis. The obtained
simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the existing $2\times2$ MIMO
configuration in the OAI, our implementation improves the data rates in almost
all scenarios, especially at the high Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs).

Abstract: We present the first implementation of a Multi-User Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) transmission scheme on the Physical Downlink Shared
Channel (PDSCH) for 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) based on
OpenAirInterface (OAI). Our implementation features a fully functional
O-RAN-compliant 5G New Radio (5G NR) system, including a 5G Core Network (5G
CN), a refined 5G RAN, which is split into a Centre Unit (CU) and an
Distributed Unit (DU), and 5G NR User Equipment (UEs). This implementation
demonstrates MU-MIMO performance in the downlink while showcasing the
disaggregation capabilities of O-RAN. Specifically, the Base Station (i.e. gNB)
in our setup is capable of serving two UEs simultaneously over the same
downlink Resource Block (RBs). User scheduling is performed based on the
Precoding Matrix Indicators (PMIs) reported by the UEs according to the NR
Channel State Information (CSI) reporting procedure. The system throughput
performance is evaluated using $\textit{iperf}$. The obtained results via
simulation and testbed experiments demonstrate that the MU-MIMO scheme achieves
significant downlink throughput gains, particularly in the high
Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) regime, while keeping the Block Error Rate (BLER)
below the required threshold of $10^{-1}$ for both UEs.

Abstract: Networks exploiting distributed integrated sensing and communication (DISAC)
nodes can provide enhanced localization and sensing performance, further
emphasized when operating with large arrays and bandwidths available in the
upper mid-band (also known as FR3). In this paper, we consider a DISAC system
operating at FR3 where a single base station (BS) acts as the transmitter and
several vehicular user equipments (UEs) act as the receivers. We tackle the
design of the signal processing chain at the UE side to enable joint UE
positioning and target localization. The system model exploits a
multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) waveform, and incorporates practical effects such as inter-node
timing offsets (TOs), extended targets, dense multipath, and realistic uniform
planar arrays (UPAs) at both ends. The proposed design includes a multipath
estimation stage at each UE, clutter removal, a novel clustering and
association scheme, and a final joint estimator of UE positions and target
locations. The estimator solves a weighted least squares (WLS) problem to
jointly compute clock offsets and localize UEs and targets. Numerical results
considering two UEs and two targets show that for 80\% of the cases the target
localization error is below 32cm, while the UE positioning error is below 44cm.

Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in
wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial
degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D)
boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new
RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum
sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary
communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the
joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at
the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR),
while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and
the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated
problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables,
we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO)
and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality
solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system
substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR
systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication
quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of electronic information technology, the number
and variety of unknown radiation sources have increased significantly. Some of
these sources share common characteristics, which offers the potential to
effectively address the challenge of identifying unknown radiation sources.
However, research on the classification of radiation sources remains relatively
limited. This paper proposes a big data analysis method that combines linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) with a rough neighborhood set (NRS) for radiation
source classification, and its effectiveness is validated on the RadioML 2018

types can be categorized into four distinct classes, laying a foundation for
further research on cognitive interference signal cancellation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Cellular wireless systems are witnessing the proliferation of frequency bands
over a wide spectrum, particularly with the expansion of new bands in FR3.
These bands must be supported in user equipment (UE) handsets with multiple
antennas in a constrained form factor. Rapid variations in channel quality
across the bands from motion and hand blockage, limited field-of-view of
antennas, and hardware and power-constrained measurement sparsity pose
significant challenges to reliable multi-band channel tracking. This paper
formulates the problem of predicting achievable rates across multiple antenna
arrays and bands with sparse historical measurements. We propose a
transformer-based neural architecture that takes asynchronous rate histories as
input and outputs per-array rate predictions. Evaluated on ray-traced
simulations in a dense urban micro-cellular setting with FR1 and FR3 arrays,
our method demonstrates superior performance over baseline predictors, enabling
more informed band selection under realistic mobility and hardware constraints.

### [9] [Doppler-Based Multistatic Drone Tracking via Cellular Downlink Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25732)
*Chenqing Ji,Qionghui Liu,Jiahong Liu,Chao Yu,Yifei Sun,Rui Wang,Fan Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出一种利用LTE下行信号的多普勒感知系统进行无人机追踪的方法，无需传统距离和角度测量即可实现高精度轨迹重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过LTE基站信号和多普勒测量实现无人机高精度追踪的可行性，以减少对传统测量方式的依赖。

Method: 利用LTE基站作为信号源，部署三个被动接收器从不同位置捕获多普勒频移，通过最小均方误差问题重建无人机轨迹。

Result: 实验显示，即使在200米外的复杂轨迹条件下，90%的追踪误差低于90厘米。

Conclusion: 仅依赖多普勒检测在接收器部署密度足够高时可实现高精度无人机追踪。

Abstract: In this paper, a multistatic Doppler sensing system is proposed for the drone
tracking via downlink Long-Term Evolution (LTE) signals. Specifically, the LTE
base stations (BSs) are exploited as signal illuminators, and three passive
sensing receivers are deployed at different locations to detect the bistatic
Doppler frequencies of a target drone from received downlink signals. It is
shown that even without the measurements of BS-drone-receiver range and angle,
the Doppler measurements could provide sufficient information for trajectory
tracking. Particularly, the trajectory of the target drone, consisting of the
initial position and velocities of all the time slots, can be reconstructed by
solving a minimum mean-squared error problem according to the above Doppler
measurements. It is demonstrated by experiment that although the target drone
and all the sensing receivers are around 200 meters away from the illuminating
BSs, the complicated trajectories can be tracked with 90% errors below 90
centimeters. Since this accuracy is notably higher than the typical range
resolution of LTE signals, the demonstration shows that drone trajectory
tracking with a high accuracy could be feasible solely according to Doppler
detection, as long as the deployment density of receivers is sufficiently high.

Conclusion: 数字孪生技术为无线通信任务提供了高效的数据生成和模型训练方法，保真度分析框架对其开发具有指导意义。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated strong performance in
compressing and reconstructing channel state information (CSI) while reducing
feedback overhead in massive MIMO systems. A key challenge, however, is their
reliance on extensive site-specific training data, whose real-world collection
incurs significant overhead and limits scalability across deployment sites. To
address this, we propose leveraging site-specific digital twins to assist the
training of DL-based CSI compression models. The digital twin integrates an
electromagnetic (EM) 3D model of the environment, a hardware model, and ray
tracing to produce site-specific synthetic CSI data, allowing DL models to be
trained without the need for extensive real-world measurements. We further
develop a fidelity analysis framework that decomposes digital twin quality into
four key aspects: 3D geometry, material properties, ray tracing, and hardware
modeling. We explore how these factors influence the reliability of the data
and model performance. To enhance the adaptability to real-world environments,
we propose a refinement strategy that incorporates a limited amount of
real-world data to fine-tune the DL model pre-trained on the digital twin
dataset. Evaluation results show that models trained on site-specific digital
twins outperform those trained on generic datasets, with the proposed
refinement method effectively enhancing performance using limited real-world
data. The simulations also highlight the importance of digital twin fidelity,
especially in 3D geometry, ray tracing, and hardware modeling, for improving
CSI reconstruction quality. This analysis framework offers valuable insights
into the critical fidelity aspects, and facilitates more efficient digital twin
development and deployment strategies for various wireless communication tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高速铁路场景下的延迟多普勒（DD）域信道测量与建模方法，验证了DD域信道模型的准确性，并为高移动环境中的DD域建模提供了理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为应对下一代无线通信系统在高频段和高移动场景中的需求，传统的信道建模方法在DD域的建模研究不足，亟需系统性方法。

Method: 设计了基于LTE-R系统的DD域信道测量方法，研究了DD域信道的准静止区间、多径分量的统计功率建模以及衰落系数的准不变区间。

Result: 通过高速铁路测量验证了DD域信道模型的准确性，并发现衰落系数的准不变区间远小于准静止区间。

Conclusion: 该研究为高移动环境中的DD域建模提供了理论基础，支持未来6G及以上的DDMC和集成感知通信设计。

Abstract: As next-generation wireless communication systems need to be able to operate
in high-frequency bands and high-mobility scenarios, delay-Doppler (DD) domain
multicarrier (DDMC) modulation schemes, such as orthogonal time frequency space
(OTFS), demonstrate superior reliability over orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM). Accurate DD domain channel modeling is essential for DDMC
system design. However, since traditional channel modeling approaches are
mainly confined to time, frequency, and space domains, the principles of DD
domain channel modeling remain poorly studied. To address this issue, we
propose a systematic DD domain channel measurement and modeling methodology in
high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. First, we design a DD domain channel
measurement method based on the long-term evolution for railway (LTE-R) system.
Second, for DD domain channel modeling, we investigate quasi-stationary
interval, statistical power modeling of multipath components, and particularly,
the quasi-invariant intervals of DD domain channel fading coefficients. Third,
via LTE-R measurements at 371 km/h, taking the quasi-stationary interval as the
decision criterion, we establish DD domain channel models under different
channel time-varying conditions in HSR scenarios. Fourth, the accuracy of
proposed DD domain channel models is validated via bit error rate comparison of
OTFS transmission. In addition, simulation verifies that in HSR scenario, the
quasi-invariant interval of DD domain channel fading coefficient is on
millisecond (ms) order of magnitude, which is much smaller than the
quasi-stationary interval length on $100$ ms order of magnitude. This study
could provide theoretical guidance for DD domain modeling in high-mobility
environments, supporting future DDMC and integrated sensing and communication
designs for 6G and beyond.

### [12] [Closed-Form Least-Squares Design of Fast-Convolution Based Variable-Bandwidth FIR Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25931)
*Oksana Moryakova,Håkan Johansson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于快速卷积（FC）的可变带宽（VBW）有限冲激响应（FIR）滤波器的闭式最小二乘（LS）设计方法。该方法利用频率采样和重叠-存储（OLS）方法，显著降低了实现和带宽重配置的复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案在设计和实现可变带宽滤波器时复杂度较高，且带宽范围受限。本文旨在通过频率域设计和OLS方法结合，降低复杂度并扩展带宽范围。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法不仅显著降低了复杂度，还扩展了带宽范围，并通过权重函数减少了最大近似误差能量。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为设计高性能可变带宽滤波器提供了一种高效的闭式解决方案，兼具复杂度和性能优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces a closed-form least-squares (LS) design approach for
fast-convolution (FC) based variable-bandwidth (VBW) finite-impulse-response
(FIR) filters. The proposed LS design utilizes frequency sampling and the VBW
filter frequency-domain implementation using the overlap-save (OLS) method,
that together offer significant savings in implementation and online bandwidth
reconfiguration complexities. Since combining frequency-domain design and OLS
implementation leads to a linear periodic time-varying (LPTV) behavior of the
VBW filter, a set of the corresponding time-invariant impulse responses is
considered in the proposed design. Through numerical examples, it is
demonstrated that the proposed approach enables not only closed-form design of
FC-based VBW filters with substantial complexity reductions compared to
existing solutions for a given performance, but also allows the variable
bandwidth range to be extended without any increase in complexity. Moreover, a
way of reducing the maximum approximation error energy over the whole set of
the time-invariant filters of the LPTV system is shown by introducing
appropriate weighting functions in the design.

Abstract: Satellite systems are expected to be a cornerstone of sixth-generation (6G)
networks, providing ubiquitous coverage and supporting a wide range of services
across communications, sensing, and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT).
Meeting these demands with current function-specific payload architectures is
challenging in terms of cost, spectral use, and sustainability. This survey
introduces the framework of multi-functional satellite systems (MFSS), which
integrate two or more of these core services into a single payload, enabling
resource sharing and functional synergy. A unified taxonomy is proposed,
covering joint communications and sensing (JCAS), joint communications and PNT
(JCAP), joint sensing and PNT (JSAP), and fully integrated joint
communications, sensing, and PNT (JCSAP) systems. The paper reviews the
state-of-the-art in each domain, examines existing payload architectures, and
outlines cooperative, integrated, and joint design strategies. Key challenges,
including waveform co-design, synchronization, interference mitigation, and
resource management, are discussed, along with potential solutions and future
research directions. By unifying diverse satellite capabilities within a single
platform, MFSS can achieve higher spectral efficiency, reduced launch mass and
cost, improved energy use, and enhanced service versatility, contributing to
the development of sustainable and intelligent non-terrestrial networks (NTNs)
for the 6G and beyond space era.

Motivation: 解决传统状态估计算法依赖预定义模型的局限性以及神经网络方法需要大量预训练数据的问题。

Method: 将输入层激活和网络权重作为潜在状态在线估计，并实例化为扩展卡尔曼、无迹卡尔曼和粒子估计三种经典估计器。

Result: 在三种场景中，新方法不仅保持了鲁棒学习能力，还超越或匹配了传统和预训练神经网络方法的精度。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架在状态估计中展示了优越的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Classical state estimation algorithms rely on predefined target's state-space
model, which complicates model derivation and limits adaptability when system
dynamics change. Neural network based estimators offer a data-driven
alternative, but rarely fuse classical estimation theory into their structure
and demand large, pre-computed training sets. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a unified state-space structure without target's state-space model and
treats both the input-layer activations and all network weights as latent
states to be estimated online. We instantiate this nonlinear model with three
canonical estimators-the extended Kalman estimator, the unscented Kalman
estimator, and the particle estimator to simulate different neural network and
demonstrate its generality. We then benchmark our approach against seven
leading neural network estimators across three representative scenarios.
Results show that our neural network state-space estimators not only retain the
robust learning capability, but also match or exceed the accuracy of both
classical and pre-trained neural network methods. Code, data, and more result:

### [15] [Performance Evaluation of eLoran Spatial ASF Corrections Based on Measured ASF Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26018)
*Jaewon Yu,Pyo-Woong Son*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文通过测量ASF地图分析韩国eLoran系统中空间ASF校正方法的有效性，发现局部校正显著提升定位性能，而广域校正仅在参考站附近有有限改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同类型的ASF校正方法在韩国eLoran系统中的定位性能表现。

Method: 比较了三种校正场景：无校正（S0）、使用真实ASF值的局部校正（S1）和基于单一参考站的广域校正（S2）。

Result: S1表现最优，定位误差最低；S0误差最大；S2仅在参考站附近有效，随距离和ASF空间梯度增加而表现下降。

Conclusion: 局部ASF校正可显著提升eLoran定位性能，而广域校正的效果局限于参考站附近。

Abstract: This paper analyzes the effectiveness of spatial ASF correction methods in
the Korean eLoran system using measured ASF maps. Three correction scenarios
were evaluated under identical simulation settings: no correction (S0), local
correction using true ASF values (S1), and wide-area correction using a single
reference station value (S2). Simulation results show that S1 consistently
achieved the lowest positioning errors, while S0 exhibited the largest errors
with extensive high-error regions. S2 provided limited improvements near the
reference station but degraded with increasing distance and ASF spatial
gradients. The findings highlight that local ASF correction significantly
improves eLoran positioning performance, whereas wide-area correction has only
localized benefits.

*Junwoo Song,Pyo-woong Son*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究分析了eLoran信号传播延迟的时间变化与信号路径上气象因素的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: eLoran系统因其高场强而表现出对干扰和欺骗的鲁棒性，但其地面波传播延迟受地表条件变化影响，研究旨在揭示气象因素对传播延迟的影响。

Method: 分析不同信号路径点上eLoran信号传播延迟的时间变化与气象因素的相关性。

Result: 研究揭示了气象因素与eLoran信号传播延迟之间的关系。

Conclusion: 气象因素显著影响eLoran信号的传播延迟，这对eLoran系统的可靠性改进具有重要意义。

Abstract: Unlike GNSS, which is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing due to its
inherently weak received power, eLoran exhibits robustness owing to its high
field strength. Therefore, the eLoran system can maintain reliable operation
even in scenarios where GNSS becomes unavailable. However, since eLoran signals
propagate through ground waves, the propagation delay is susceptible to changes
in surface conditions, including both terrain and meteorological variations.
This study aims to analyze the correlation between the temporal variations in
eLoran signal propagation delay and meteorological factors at various points
along the signal path.

### [17] [Enhancing Connectivity for Emergency Vehicles Through UAV Trajectory and Resource Allocation Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26067)
*S. Fatemeh Bozorgi,S. Mohammad Razavizadeh,Mohsen Rezaee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了一种基于无人机（UAV）的车载通信系统，针对紧急车辆和普通车辆的不同需求进行联合优化设计，解决资源分配和轨迹规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧急车辆（如救护车和消防车）在复杂交通和环境条件下需要高效的通信支持，以实时获取关键信息。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方案在满足服务需求方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 无人机辅助的车载通信系统能有效支持紧急车辆和普通车辆的差异化通信需求，优化后的资源分配和轨迹设计显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Effective communication for emergency vehicles - such as ambulances and fire
trucks - is essential to support their operations in various traffic and
environmental conditions. In this context, this paper investigates a vehicular
communication system assisted by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which
adjusts its trajectory and resource allocation according to communication
needs. The system classifies vehicles into two groups to address their varying
service requirements: emergency vehicles, which require a minimum instantaneous
data rate to access critical information timely, and normal vehicles. To
support both categories effectively, this paper proposes a joint optimization
approach that coordinates UAV trajectory planning and Dynamic Bandwidth
Allocation (DBA). The objective is to maximize the minimum average data rate
for normal vehicles while ensuring that emergency vehicles maintain an
instantaneous rate above a predefined threshold. This approach takes into
account some system constraints, including UAV propulsion power consumption,
mobility limitations, and backhaul capacity. To tackle the resulting non-convex
problem, an iterative optimization method is employed, where the original
problem is decomposed into two subproblems: bandwidth allocation and UAV
trajectory design. In each iteration, the trajectory subproblem is solved using
the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) method. Numerical results confirm
that the proposed solution achieves superior performance in meeting service
requirements compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a secure integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)
framework for multi-user systems with multiple communication users (CUs) and
adversarial targets, where the design problem is formulated to maximize secrecy
rate under joint sensing and communication constraints. An efficient solution
is presented based on an accelerated fractional programming method using a
non-homogeneous complex quadratic transform (QT), which decomposes the problem
into tractable subproblems for beamforming and artificial noise (AN)
optimization. Unlike conventional artificial noise strategies, the proposed
approach also exploits AN to enhance sensing while avoiding interference with
legitimate users. Simulation results show significant gains in secrecy rate,
communication reliability, and sensing accuracy, confirming the effectiveness
and scalability of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成对抗模型依赖已知参考点或预定义先验，而FinGAN通过最大化生成数据与参考点间的互信息，实现端到端的RSS生成。

Method: FinGAN从参考点直接生成RSS数据，通过学习RSS值与参考点间的潜在信息，避免了依赖预定义先验的需求。

Result: FinGAN生成的合成RSS数据与实地实验数据高度一致，定位性能接近完整真实数据集。

Conclusion: FinGAN在不同办公环境中表现一致，验证了其泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: This work introduces FinGAN, a robust received signal strength (RSS) data
generator designed to expand RSS fingerprint datasets. Compared to existing
generative adversarial models that either rely on known reference positions
(RPs) or depend on predefined priors, FinGAN learns the latent information
between RPs and RSS values by maximizing the mutual information between the
generated RSS data and the RPs, enabling an end-to-end RSS generation directly
from RPs. This allows us to accurately generate RSS data for previously
unmeasured RPs. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that
FinGAN produces synthetic RSS data closely aligned with real RSS sample
collected from the on-site experiment, preserving localization performance
comparable to that achieved with complete real-world datasets. To further
validate its generalizability, FinGAN is also trained and evaluated on
open-source datasets from three typical office environments,and the results
demonstrate consistent performance across different scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于风险聚合的多输入单输出（MISO）下行链路无线网络中加权和速率最大化的方法，通过条件风险价值（CVaR）保障用户速率可靠性，并设计了一种名为αRGNN的图神经网络策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多输入单输出无线网络中，加权和速率最大化问题需要兼顾用户速率可靠性，尤其是在信道衰落不确定性的情况下。传统的优化方法难以有效解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种风险聚合的加权和速率最大化问题，利用CVaR作为功能函数，建立了与加权风险厌恶MSE问题的等价性，并设计了αRGNN图神经网络策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，αRGNN能够完全消除用户深层速率衰落，显著降低用户速率统计变异性，同时保持足够的遍历性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为无线网络中的速率可靠性问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过风险聚合和图神经网络策略实现了高性能和可靠性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing weighted sum rate in a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) downlink wireless network with emphasis on user rate
reliability. We introduce a novel risk-aggregated formulation of the complex
WSR maximization problem, which utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)
as a functional for enforcing rate (ultra)-reliability over channel fading
uncertainty/risk. We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed
precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design
a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation
(PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to
maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel
realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that
a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and
substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while
retaining adequate ergodic performance.

Conclusion: BD-RIS技术在发射端的应用为ISAC提供了更高效的解决方案，具有显著的性能和复杂度优势。

Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) have emerged as
a promising technology for 6G wireless networks, offering more advanced control
over electromagnetic wave propagation than conventional diagonal RIS. This
paper proposes a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework
that incorporates BD-RIS at the transmitter. This not only opens the door to
enhanced sensing and communication performance, but also alleviates the need
for large-scale fully digital radio frequency (RF) chains at the transmitter.
Based on the proposed system model, we formulate a normalized weighted
optimization problem to jointly design the active beamforming and the BD-RIS
scattering matrix with the aim of jointly minimizing the trace of the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for sensing targets and maximizing the sum rate (SR)
for communication users. To address this highly coupled optimization problem,
we propose a novel and low-complexity iterative algorithm that efficiently
solves the active beamforming and scattering matrix subproblems by transforming
each into a series of tractable projection problems with closed-form solutions.
Numerical results show the appealing capability of the transmitter-side
BD-RIS-aided ISAC over conventional diagonal RIS-aided ISAC in enhancing both
sensing and communication performance. Moreover, compared to the classic
iterative algorithm, the proposed algorithm offers enhanced dual-functional
performance while significantly reducing the computational complexity.

TL;DR: 提出一种物理信息驱动的多源域适应框架，无需目标建筑的损伤标签即可预测震后结构损伤，解决了标注数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 震后结构损伤的高效智能评估对灾害快速响应至关重要，但传统监督学习依赖大量标注数据，难以获取。

Conclusion: 该框架为标注数据稀缺场景下的结构损伤评估提供了鲁棒解决方案，显著提升了震后损伤评估能力。

Abstract: Efficient and intelligent assessment of post-earthquake structural damage is
critical for rapid disaster response. While data-driven approaches have shown
promise, traditional supervised learning methods rely on extensive labeled
datasets, which are often impractical to obtain for damaged structures. To
address this limitation, we propose a physics-informed multi-source domain
adaptation framework to predict post-earthquake structural damage for a target
building without requiring damage labels. The multi-source domain integrates
actual damage data and numerical modeling data from buildings similar to the
target structure. The framework operates through three key steps. First, the
similarity of key physics from each domain are analyzed to form a weight
matrix, which enhances domain differentiation. Second, features from the
multi-source and target domains are extracted and fed into a classifier and a
discriminator. The classifier ensures that the features are damage-sensitive
and accurately assign damage states, while the discriminator enforces that the
features remain domain-invariant. Finally, the key parameters matrix is applied
as weights during adversarial training to optimize the contribution of features
from each source domain. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for
assessing structural damage in scenarios where labeled data is scarce,
significantly advancing the capabilities of post-earthquake damage evaluation.

existence was hypothesized in the XVI century to explain the consonance of the
minor chord. We additionally show how the nonlinearity of the energy can be
used to study the emergence of the combination tone (Tartini's third sound)
shedding new light on this long debated subject.

*Hossein Nasiri,Muhammad Iqbal Rochman,Monisha Ghosh*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用GNSS信号进行室内/室外（I/O）分类的方法，以解决中频段频谱共享中的挑战，并通过多模态数据融合提高了分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中频段（1-10 GHz）在联邦和商业应用中的需求增长，尤其是室内商业应用（如工厂自动化），促使需要一种可靠的方法自动区分设备是否在室内，以避免干扰户外现有用户。

Method: 利用GNSS信号的特性（室外接收强、室内衰减大），开发了基于阈值的技术和机器学习方法，并结合Wi-Fi数据进行多模态数据融合。

Result: 结果显示，仅使用GNSS信号的方法在陌生环境中比仅依赖Wi-Fi数据的方法更准确，且GNSS与Wi-Fi数据结合进一步提升了分类精度。

Conclusion: GNSS信号是一种有效的室内/室外分类手段，多模态数据融合显著提升了分类性能，为频谱共享提供了自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and
commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial
indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to
spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents
can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing,
between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where
unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor
incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no
reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or
outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor
access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and
reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate
indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling
automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To
this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for
I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and
highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and
distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various
methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning
approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse
geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone
can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi)
data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of
GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy,
showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过神经网络优化JCAS系统的感知性能，特别是在低信噪比条件下，减少传统调制与几何形状调制之间的性能差距。

Method: 实现基于神经网络的多个关键组件，如波束成形器和调制器，并利用多快照感知和去耦合损失函数优化训练。

Result: 神经网络的感知性能优于传统算法（如Neyman-Pearson检测器和ESPRIT），尤其在低信噪比下；多快照感知显著缩小了传统与几何形状调制的性能差距。

Conclusion: 强调了估计边界对训练神经网络的重要性，特别是在多变信噪比条件下部署时。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order modulation formats on the sensing
performance of single-carrier joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems.
Several separate components such as a beamformer, a modulator, a target
detector, an angle of arrival (AoA) estimator and a communication demapper are
implemented as trainable neural networks (NNs). We compare geometrically shaped
modulation formats to a classical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme.
We assess the influence of multi-snapshot sensing and varying signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) on the overall performance of the autoencoder-based system. To
improve the training behavior of the system, we decouple the loss functions
from the respective SNR values and the number of sensing snapshots, using upper
bounds of the sensing and communication performance, namely the Cram\'er-Rao
bound for AoA estimation and the mutual information for communication. The
NN-based sensing outperforms classical algorithms, such as a Neyman-Pearson
based power detector for object detection and ESPRIT for AoA estimation for
both the trained constellations and QAM at low SNRs. We show that the gap in
sensing performance between classical and shaped modulation formats can be
significantly reduced through multi-snapshot sensing. Lastly, we demonstrate
system extension to multi-user multiple-input multiple-output to address the
improvement of spatial efficiency when servicing multiple user equipments. Our
contribution emphasizes the importance of estimation bounds for training neural
networks, especially when the trained solutions are deployed in varying SNR
conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing physical-layer security
in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems by leveraging the
reconfigurability of fluid antenna systems (FAS). We propose a joint precoding
and port selection (JPPS) strategy that maximizes the sum secrecy rate while
simultaneously ensuring reliable radar sensing. The problem is formulated using
fractional programming (FP) and solved through an iterative algorithm that
integrates FP transformations with successive convex approximation (SCA). To
reduce computational complexity, we further develop low-complexity schemes
based on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, combined with greedy port selection and
trace-inverse minimization. Simulation results demonstrate substantial
improvements in both secrecy performance and sensing accuracy compared to
conventional baselines, across a wide range of FAS ports, user loads, and
sensing targets. These findings highlight the critical importance of FAS
geometry optimization in enabling secure and efficient joint
communication-sensing for next-generation wireless networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFAR检测算法将毫米波雷达中的多散射体视为独立检测，忽略了目标的散射结构。本文旨在保留这种结构，提升检测准确性。

Method: 采用MLE和Gibbs MCMC采样进行RD片段的统计建模，提出基于偏度的假设检验，并结合IoU和峰值响应中心化优化检测流程。

Result: 通过仿真和真实数据集验证，该方法显著提升了汽车雷达应用的检测精度。

Conclusion: 提出的RD片段框架和检测流程在毫米波雷达系统中表现出高效性和适用性，尤其适合汽车雷达应用。

Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar systems, owing to their large bandwidth,
provide fine range resolution that enables the observation of multiple
scatterers originating from a single automotive target commonly referred to as
an extended target. Conventional CFAR-based detection algorithms typically
treat these scatterers as independent detections, thereby discarding the
spatial scattering structure intrinsic to the target. To preserve this
scattering spread, this paper proposes a Range-Doppler (RD) segment framework
designed to encapsulate the typical scattering profile of an automobile. The
statistical characterization of the segment is performed using Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and posterior density modeling facilitated through
Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. A skewness-based test
statistic, derived from the estimated statistical model, is introduced for
binary hypothesis classification of extended targets. Additionally, the paper
presents a detection pipeline that incorporates Intersection over Union (IoU)
and segment centering based on peak response, optimized to work within a single
dwell. Extensive evaluations using both simulated and real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, underscoring its
suitability for automotive radar applications through improved detection
accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in
autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye
View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that
rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes
highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by
fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with
HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and
rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning.
Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in
planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that
VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component in any robotic system. Over the
years, powerful tools like the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) have been
developed, offering numerous motion planning algorithms. However, existing
frameworks often struggle to deliver the level of predictability and
repeatability demanded by high-stakes applications -- ranging from ensuring
safety in industrial environments to the creation of high-quality motion
datasets for robot learning. Complementing existing tools, we introduce SRMP

robotic manipulation. SRMP distinguishes itself by generating consistent and
reliable trajectories, and is the first software tool to offer motion planning
algorithms for multi-robot manipulation tasks. SRMP easily integrates with
major simulators, including MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, and PyBullet via a Python

deployment on robot hardware and seamless integration with existing pipelines.
Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate in this paper that SRMP not only
meets the rigorous demands of industrial and safety-critical applications but
also sets a new standard for consistency in motion planning across diverse
robotic systems. Visit srmp.readthedocs.io for SRMP documentation and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模机器人学习中长时程、接触密集任务（如可变形物体操作）示范质量不一致的问题，通过奖励建模提供稳定的监督信号。

Method: 提出了一种阶段感知的视频奖励建模框架，结合高层次任务阶段和细粒度进度预测，并利用自然语言标注自动生成奖励标签；提出了RA-BC方法，通过奖励过滤和加权样本优化行为克隆。

Result: 奖励模型在验证和实际机器人实验中优于基线，RA-BC方法在折叠T恤任务中成功率达到83%（平整状态）和67%（褶皱状态），显著优于传统行为克隆（仅8%和0%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明奖励建模是实现可扩展、标注高效且鲁棒的模仿学习的关键，特别适用于长时程操作任务。

Abstract: Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to
perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language
understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation
such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is
inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded
progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision
that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware,
video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task
stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from
natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation
across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index
labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our
reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to
out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building
on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters
high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward
model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts.
Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\% success on folding T-shirts
from the flattened state and 67\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing
vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\% and 0\% success. Overall, our
results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable,
annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon
manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PACHS是一种基于并行最佳优先搜索的Actor-Critic推断算法，结合了Actor和Critic网络的输出以提高效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Actor-Critic模型的部署策略通常简单，依赖直接的Actor策略展开，忽视了Critic网络的指导作用。

Method: PACHS通过并行最佳优先搜索算法，在推断过程中同时利用Actor网络的动作生成和Critic网络的成本估计，并以两级并行性提升效率。

Result: 在机器人操作任务（如无碰撞运动规划和非抓取推动）中证明了PACHS的有效性。

Conclusion: PACHS通过结合Actor-Critic架构的两部分，显著提升了推断效率和任务性能。

Abstract: Actor-Critic models are a class of model-free deep reinforcement learning
(RL) algorithms that have demonstrated effectiveness across various robot
learning tasks. While considerable research has focused on improving training
stability and data sampling efficiency, most deployment strategies have
remained relatively simplistic, typically relying on direct actor policy
rollouts. In contrast, we propose \pachs{} (\textit{P}arallel
\textit{A}ctor-\textit{C}ritic \textit{H}euristic \textit{S}earch), an
efficient parallel best-first search algorithm for inference that leverages
both components of the actor-critic architecture: the actor network generates
actions, while the critic network provides cost-to-go estimates to guide the
search. Two levels of parallelism are employed within the search -- actions and
cost-to-go estimates are generated in batches by the actor and critic networks
respectively, and graph expansion is distributed across multiple threads. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in robotic manipulation tasks,
including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions such as
non-prehensile pushing. Visit p-achs.github.io for demonstrations and examples.

Conclusion: CoTaP框架通过整合顺应性控制和学习策略，提升了人形机器人在互动环境中的稳定性和适应性。

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body locomotion control is a critical approach for humanoid
robots to leverage their inherent advantages. Learning-based control methods
derived from retargeted human motion data provide an effective means of
addressing this issue. However, because most current human datasets lack
measured force data, and learning-based robot control is largely
position-based, achieving appropriate compliance during interaction with real
environments remains challenging. This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline
(CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based
structure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning
framework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is
proposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based
controller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is
combined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is
guided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space
compliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through
compliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold,
ensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed
strategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external
disturbances under different compliance settings.

Result: 通过校园数据微调，系统能够生成准确的地图预测并持续更新，验证了其在自动驾驶中的实用价值。

Conclusion: 该系统为动态环境下的高精地图生成提供了高效可行的解决方案，适用于实际自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing
precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to
enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is
labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online
mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras
and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D
HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap
model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD
map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data,
our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,
demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人多队列系统中任务分配的效率问题，特别是在存在随机到达和切换延迟的情况下。

Method: 提出了Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL)策略，结合马尔可夫决策过程进行优化。

Result: ESL策略在降低延迟成本和平均队列长度方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ESL策略因其简单性和鲁棒性，成为多机器人实时调度系统的实用选择。

Abstract: We study online task allocation for multi-robot, multi-queue systems with
stochastic arrivals and switching delays. Time is slotted; each location can
host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between
locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent
Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and
propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves
exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to
a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this
policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time
delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across
server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted
holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing
more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a
practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.

Result: 展示了HYPER DRIVE系统的实用功能，包括计算植被健康指数和土壤含水量。

Conclusion: 该系统为移动机器人提供了更精确的地形分析能力，尤其在光照变化环境下表现出色。

Abstract: Intra-class terrain differences such as water content directly influence a
vehicle's ability to traverse terrain, yet RGB vision systems may fail to
distinguish these properties. Evaluating a terrain's spectral content beyond
red-green-blue wavelengths to the near infrared spectrum provides useful
information for intra-class identification. However, accurate analysis of this
spectral information is highly dependent on ambient illumination. We
demonstrate a system architecture to collect and register multi-wavelength,
hyperspectral images from a mobile robot and describe an approach to
reflectance calibrate cameras under varying illumination conditions. To
showcase the practical applications of our system, HYPER DRIVE, we demonstrate
the ability to calculate vegetative health indices and soil moisture content
from a mobile robot platform.

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中达到96.4%的平均成功率，在实际任务中也表现出色。

Conclusion: dVLA展示了统一扩散框架在高性能VLA机器人中的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation
paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages
a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning,
and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception,
language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of
unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型分层扩散规划器，将任务和运动结构直接嵌入噪声模型中，通过任务条件化的结构化高斯噪声改进规划效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的扩散规划器使用零均值、各向同性高斯噪声，无法充分利用任务和运动结构信息。本文旨在通过结构化噪声模型提升规划的成功率、轨迹平滑性和任务对齐性。

Method: 采用基于高斯过程运动规划的任务条件化结构化高斯噪声，分层设计将先验生成与轨迹去噪分离。

Result: 在Maze2D目标达成和KUKA积木堆叠任务中，相比各向同性基线，本方法提高了成功率、轨迹平滑性和任务对齐性。

Conclusion: 结构化噪声模型能有效集中概率质量于可行、平滑且语义有意义的轨迹，同时保持计算可行性。

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical diffusion planner that embeds task and motion
structure directly in the noise model. Unlike standard diffusion-based planners
that use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, we employ a family of
task-conditioned structured Gaussians whose means and covariances are derived
from Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP): sparse, task-centric key states
or their associated timings (or both) are treated as noisy observations to
produce a prior instance. We first generalize the standard diffusion process to
biased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior
expressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from
trajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned
structured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the
full trajectory under that fixed prior. Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and
KUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and
stronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies
indicate that explicitly structuring the corruption process offers benefits
beyond simply conditioning the neural network. Overall, our method concentrates
probability mass of prior near feasible, smooth, and semantically meaningful
trajectories while maintaining tractability. Our project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前导航模型在多样化任务中表现不佳，缺乏统一的解决方案，导致成功率和泛化能力受限。

Method: OmniNav采用轻量级策略预测连续空间路径点，结合快速-慢速模块协作和多任务训练数据。

Result: 实验表明OmniNav在多个导航基准上达到最先进性能，并在实际部署中验证其有效性。

Conclusion: OmniNav为机器人导航提供了可扩展的统一框架，显著提升了泛化能力和任务成功率。

Abstract: Embodied navigation presents a core challenge for intelligent robots,
requiring the comprehension of visual environments, natural language
instructions, and autonomous exploration. Existing models often fall short in
offering a unified solution across diverse navigation paradigms, resulting in
low success rates and limited generalization. We introduce OmniNav, a unified
framework addressing instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal navigation, and
frontier-based exploration within a single architecture. Our approach features
a lightweight, low-latency policy that accurately predicts continuous-space
waypoints (coordinates and orientations). This policy surpasses action-chunk
methods in precision and supports real-world deployment at control frequencies
up to 5 Hz. Architecturally, OmniNav employs a fast-slow system design: a fast
module generates waypoints using short-horizon visual context and subtasks,
while a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon
observations and candidate frontiers to select subsequent subgoals and
subtasks. This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory
coherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.
Crucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation
policy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and
objects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale,
general-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and
visual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen. This significantly
improves success rates and robustness. Extensive experiments confirm OmniNav's
state-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks, with
real-world deployment further validating its efficacy. OmniNav provides
practical insights for embodied navigation, charting a scalable path towards
versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型中具有潜力，但稀疏奖励和不稳定训练阻碍了实际应用，因此需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 采用动作块的PPO和行为克隆结合，通过动态更新的演示缓冲区和自适应损失权重，提升策略的时间一致性和训练稳定性。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，成功率高达0.93，且任务完成步数较少（42.17步），优于监督微调。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了强化学习在VLA模型后训练中的可行性，为下游应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training
vision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by
sparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by
introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with
behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive
actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the
density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning
loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that
continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative
weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone
auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process.
Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over
supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to
success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA
post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.

Conclusion: TacRefineNet是首个仅通过多指尖触觉传感实现任意手内位姿精确调整的方法。

Abstract: Despite progress in both traditional dexterous grasping pipelines and recent
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches, the grasp execution stage remains
prone to pose inaccuracies, especially in long-horizon tasks, which undermines
overall performance. To address this "last-mile" challenge, we propose
TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose
refinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger
fingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based
on tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We
design a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple
fingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train
this policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile
model in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system.
Comparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning
with a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over
simulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the
effectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using
only tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable
arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone.

Motivation: 现有端到端学习方法在机器人操控中面临感知与控制耦合的挑战，导致真实数据需求量大且迁移效果不佳。

Method: 解耦框架：控制策略在模拟环境中训练（利用特权状态），感知模块在真实环境中适配，仅需少量真实演示。

Conclusion: 解耦感知与控制能有效提升sim-to-real迁移性能，减少真实数据需求并增强泛化能力。

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a fundamental challenge in robot manipulation
due to the entanglement of perception and control in end-to-end learning. We
present a decoupled framework that learns each component where it is most
reliable: control policies are trained in simulation with privileged state to
master spatial layouts and manipulation dynamics, while perception is adapted
only at deployment to bridge real observations to the frozen control policy.
Our key insight is that control strategies and action patterns are universal
across environments and can be learned in simulation through systematic
randomization, while perception is inherently domain-specific and must be
learned where visual observations are authentic. Unlike existing end-to-end
approaches that require extensive real-world data, our method achieves strong
performance with only 10-20 real demonstrations by reducing the complex
sim-to-real problem to a structured perception alignment task. We validate our
approach on tabletop manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior data efficiency
and out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines. The
learned policies successfully handle object positions and scales beyond the
training distribution, confirming that decoupling perception from control
fundamentally improves sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了基于流策略的训练不稳定问题，提升了性能且简化了训练流程。

Abstract: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy reinforcement
learning is notoriously unstable due to gradient pathologies in the multi-step
action sampling process. We trace this instability to a fundamental connection:
the flow rollout is algebraically equivalent to a residual recurrent
computation, making it susceptible to the same vanishing and exploding
gradients as RNNs. To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network
using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable
architectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which
utilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm,
enabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end
training of these policies. Our approach supports both from-scratch and
offline-to-online learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, eliminating the need
for common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

Conclusion: DP-AG为生物适应性与人工策略学习的结合提供了重要一步。

Abstract: Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which
overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action
execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this
gap, we introduce Action--Guided Diffusion Policy (DP--AG), a unified
representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between
perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP--AG encodes
latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and
evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product
(VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured
stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning
between perception and action, we introduce a cycle--consistent contrastive
loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent
perception--action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both
latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational
lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective
enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP--AG
significantly outperforms state--of--the--art methods across simulation
benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP--AG
offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial
policy learning.

Conclusion: REVER和RoboFarseer有效解决了长时程任务规划问题，将开源数据和模型。

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form
language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their
deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with
multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards
for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we
propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate
long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in
real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM
incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial
reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To
obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface
framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An
automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into
vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores
the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the
ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as
a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches
or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude
larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more
than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall
success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the
planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon
publication.

*Valentin Yuryev,Max Polzin,Josie Hughes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络的状态估计方法，用于估计具备主动或被动柔性的移动机器人在不确定场景中的状态，解决了因缺乏刚性假设和形态变化带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 柔性机器人在农业、研究和环境应用中展现出鲁棒性，但缺乏刚性假设和形态变化对状态估计提出了挑战。

Method: 使用神经网络结合历史状态和传感器数据，直接作用于不可靠传感器，提出了一个新的柔性地心坐标系来训练网络。

Result: 在GOAT平台上测试，实现了形状测量误差4.2%、速度和角度误差分别为6.3%和2.4%、方向误差1.5度，且在电机故障时增加了300%的移动范围。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了柔性机器人在复杂户外环境中的状态估计性能，尤其是在传感器不可靠或形态变化时的表现。

Abstract: Locomotion robots with active or passive compliance can show robustness to
uncertain scenarios, which can be promising for agricultural, research and
environmental industries. However, state estimation for these robots is
challenging due to the lack of rigid-body assumptions and kinematic changes
from morphing. We propose a method to estimate typical rigid-body states
alongside compliance-related states, such as soft robot shape in different
morphologies and locomotion modes. Our neural network-based state estimator
uses a history of states and a mechanism to directly influence unreliable
sensors. We test our framework on the GOAT platform, a robot capable of passive
compliance and active morphing for extreme outdoor terrain. The network is
trained on motion capture data in a novel compliance-centric frame that
accounts for morphing-related states. Our method predicts shape-related
measurements within 4.2% of the robot's size, velocities within 6.3% and 2.4%
of the top linear and angular speeds, respectively, and orientation within 1.5
degrees. We also demonstrate a 300% increase in travel range during a motor
malfunction when using our estimator for closed-loop autonomous outdoor
operation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型人机交互框架，通过电容式编织触觉皮肤实现直观的手势控制，显著提升交互效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统HRI界面（如控制面板或手持设备）的不灵活性，实现更自然的人机交互。

Method: 采用电容式编织触觉皮肤，结合织物灵活性与多通道传感，定义14种手势动作映射，并设计轻量卷积-Transformer模型进行实时手势识别。

Result: 手势识别准确率接近100%，机器人任务完成时间最多减少57%。

Conclusion: 该框架为人机交互提供了一种更自然、高效的实践路径。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel human-robot interaction (HRI) framework that
enables intuitive gesture-driven control through a capacitance-based woven
tactile skin. Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld
devices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot
surfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human
intent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility
with structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the
interlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a
gesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover
representative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary
functions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture
recognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior
baseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place
and pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to
57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed
framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient
embodied HRI.

Motivation: 为了解决目标导航问题，MUVLA旨在统一和结构化历史信息，并通过密集短期进度信号优化动作预测。

Method: MUVLA采用三阶段训练：学习地图级空间理解、从混合质量演示中模仿行为，以及奖励增强。

Result: 在HM3D和Gibson基准测试中，MUVLA表现出优秀的泛化能力，并能从低质量轨迹中学习有效的探索行为。

Conclusion: MUVLA通过多阶段训练和奖励建模，显著提升了目标导航的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present MUVLA, a Map Understanding Vision-Language-Action
model tailored for object navigation. It leverages semantic map abstractions to
unify and structure historical information, encoding spatial context in a
compact and consistent form. MUVLA takes the current and history observations,
as well as the semantic map, as inputs and predicts the action sequence based
on the description of goal object. Furthermore, it amplifies supervision
through reward-guided return modeling based on dense short-horizon progress
signals, enabling the model to develop a detailed understanding of action value
for reward maximization. MUVLA employs a three-stage training pipeline:
learning map-level spatial understanding, imitating behaviors from
mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification. This strategy allows
MUVLA to unify diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and
generate more rational exploration strategies. Experiments on HM3D and Gibson
benchmarks demonstrate that MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns
effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful
trajectories.

TL;DR: 毫米波雷达因其在恶劣条件下的经济性和可靠性，在状态估计中受到关注。现有方法依赖稀疏的雷达点云，但受限于多路径效应的伪点和角度分辨率，性能不佳。S$^3$E通过自监督融合雷达信号频谱和惯性数据，提出跨模态融合技术提升空间结构信息，实验证明无需地面真值监督即可实现精准定位。


<details>

Motivation: 现有毫米波雷达状态估计方法依赖稀疏点云，存在多路径伪点和角度分辨率低的缺陷，亟需更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出S$^3$E方法，自监督融合雷达信号频谱和惯性数据，引入跨模态融合技术增强空间结构信息。

Result: 实验表明该方法在无地面真值监督下仍能实现鲁棒且精准的状态估计。

Conclusion: S$^3$E首次尝试以自监督方式融合雷达频谱和惯性数据，为状态估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar for state estimation is gaining significant attention
for its affordability and reliability in harsh conditions. Existing
localization solutions typically rely on post-processed radar point clouds as
landmark points. Nonetheless, the inherent sparsity of radar point clouds,
ghost points from multi-path effects, and limited angle resolution in
single-chirp radar severely degrade state estimation performance. To address
these issues, we propose S$^3$E, a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{S}upervised
\textbf{S}tate \textbf{E}stimator that employs more richly informative radar
signal spectra to bypass sparse points and fuses complementary inertial
information to achieve accurate localization. S$^3$E fully explores the
association between \textit{exteroceptive} radar and \textit{proprioceptive}
inertial sensor to achieve complementary benefits. To deal with limited angle
resolution, we introduce a novel cross-fusion technique that enhances spatial
structure information by exploiting subtle rotational shift correlations across
heterogeneous data. The experimental results demonstrate our method achieves
robust and accurate performance without relying on localization ground truth
supervision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to achieve
state estimation by fusing radar spectra and inertial data in a complementary
self-supervised manner.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器人情感表达对儿童行为的影响，发现儿童会模仿机器人的情绪状态，但更高的表达水平并未增加这种一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着具有情感表达能力的机器人发展，研究其在儿童行为中的说服潜力成为重要问题。

Method: 通过一项初步研究（22名7-11岁儿童），考察机器人不同情感表达水平（身体、面部或两者）对儿童行为的影响。

Result: 儿童行为会与机器人情绪状态一致，但更高表达水平未增强一致性。

Conclusion: 研究为机器人情感表达在塑造儿童社交行为中的作用提供了初步思考。

Abstract: The growing development of robots with artificial emotional expressiveness
raises important questions about their persuasive potential in children's
behavior. While research highlights the pragmatic value of emotional
expressiveness in human social communication, the extent to which robotic
expressiveness can or should influence empathic responses in children is
grounds for debate. In a pilot study with 22 children (aged 7-11) we begin to
explore the ways in which different levels of embodied expressiveness (body
only, face only, body and face) of two basic emotions (happiness and sadness)
displayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) might modify children's
behavior in a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. We observed that
children aligned their behavior to the robot's inferred emotional state.
However, higher levels of expressiveness did not result in increased alignment.
The preliminary results reported here provide a starting point for reflecting
on robotic expressiveness and its role in shaping children's social-emotional
behavior toward robots as social peers in the near future.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补机器人学中离散与连续接触模型之间的理论空白，为接触动力学模拟和高级控制算法设计提供数学一致且计算可行的基础。

Method: 提出了平面Signorini条件的锥互补性公式，证明了其与在整个接触面上强制Signorini定律的等价性，并通过几何解释统一了三种物理状态（粘附、分离和倾斜）。

Result: 建立了经典中心压力的扩展版本（扩展中心压力），为平面接触提供了数学一致的计算框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为平面接触的精确模拟和机器人控制优化算法提供了理论基础，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a unifying theoretical result that connects two foundational
principles in robotics: the Signorini law for point contacts, which underpins
many simulation methods for preventing object interpenetration, and the center
of pressure (also known as the zero-moment point), a key concept used in, for
instance, optimization-based locomotion control. Our contribution is the planar
Signorini condition, a conic complementarity formulation that models general
planar contacts between rigid bodies. We prove that this formulation is
equivalent to enforcing the punctual Signorini law across an entire contact
surface, thereby bridging the gap between discrete and continuous contact
models. A geometric interpretation reveals that the framework naturally
captures three physical regimes -sticking, separating, and tilting-within a
unified complementarity structure. This leads to a principled extension of the
classical center of pressure, which we refer to as the extended center of
pressure. By establishing this connection, our work provides a mathematically
consistent and computationally tractable foundation for handling planar
contacts, with implications for both the accurate simulation of contact
dynamics and the design of advanced control and optimization algorithms in
locomotion and manipulation.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多达20个智能体和数百个可移动障碍物的场景中表现良好，但各有优缺点。

Conclusion: 研究为M-PAMO问题提供了初步解决方案，展示了融合方法的潜力与局限性。

Abstract: This paper investigates Multi-Agent Path Finding Among Movable Obstacles
(M-PAMO), which seeks collision-free paths for multiple agents from their start
to goal locations among static and movable obstacles. M-PAMO arises in
logistics and warehouses where mobile robots are among unexpected movable
objects. Although Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and single-agent Path
planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO) were both studied, M-PAMO remains
under-explored. Movable obstacles lead to new fundamental challenges as the
state space, which includes both agents and movable obstacles, grows
exponentially with respect to the number of agents and movable obstacles. In
particular, movable obstacles often closely couple agents together spatially
and temporally. This paper makes a first attempt to adapt and fuse the popular
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Prioritized Planning (PP) for MAPF, and a
recent single-agent PAMO planner called PAMO*, together to address M-PAMO. We
compare their performance with up to 20 agents and hundreds of movable
obstacles, and show the pros and cons of these approaches.

Conclusion: EA-CoRL展示了持续策略适应在机器人联合设计中的关键作用，为未来机器人系统优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen significant advancements in both design and
control, with a growing emphasis on integrating these aspects to enhance
overall performance. Traditionally, robot design has followed a sequential
process, where control algorithms are developed after the hardware is
finalized. However, this can be myopic and prevent robots to fully exploit
their hardware capabilities. Recent approaches advocate for co-design,
optimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic
capabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based
Co-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with
evolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy
to the hardware. EA-CoRL comprises two key components: Design Evolution, which
explores the hardware choices using an evolutionary algorithm to identify
efficient configurations, and Policy Continuous Adaptation, which fine-tunes a
task-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize performance
rewards. We evaluate EA-CoRL by co-designing the actuators (gear ratios) and
control policy of the RH5 humanoid for a highly dynamic chin-up task,
previously unfeasible due to actuator limitations. Comparative results against
state-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods show that EA-CoRL achieves higher
fitness score and broader design space exploration, highlighting the critical
role of continuous policy adaptation in robot co-design.

Abstract: This research presents a multi-robot system for inpatient care, designed
using swarm intelligence principles and incorporating wearable health sensors,
RF-based communication, and AI-driven decision support. Within a simulated
hospital environment, the system adopts a leader-follower swarm configuration
to perform patient monitoring, medicine delivery, and emergency assistance. Due
to ethical constraints, live patient trials were not conducted; instead,
validation was carried out through controlled self-testing with wearable
sensors. The Leader Robot acquires key physiological parameters, including
temperature, SpO2, heart rate, and fall detection, and coordinates other robots
when required. The Assistant Robot patrols corridors for medicine delivery,
while a robotic arm provides direct drug administration. The swarm-inspired
leader-follower strategy enhanced communication reliability and ensured
continuous monitoring, including automated email alerts to healthcare staff.
The system hardware was implemented using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NRF24L01 RF
modules, and a HuskyLens AI camera. Experimental evaluation showed an overall
sensor accuracy above 94%, a 92% task-level success rate, and a 96%
communication reliability rate, demonstrating system robustness. Furthermore,
the AI-enabled decision support was able to provide early warnings of abnormal
health conditions, highlighting the potential of the system as a cost-effective
solution for hospital automation and patient safety.

Abstract: The transition of seaweed farming to an alternative food source on an
industrial scale relies on automating its processes through smart farming,
equivalent to land agriculture. Key to this process are autonomous underwater
vehicles (AUVs) via their capacity to automate crop and structural inspections.
However, the current bottleneck for their deployment is ensuring safe
navigation within farms, which requires an accurate, online estimate of the AUV
pose and map of the infrastructure. To enable this, we propose an efficient
side scan sonar-based (SSS) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
framework that exploits the geometry of kelp farms via modeling structural
ropes in the back-end as sequences of individual landmarks from each SSS ping
detection, instead of combining detections into elongated representations. Our
method outperforms state of the art solutions in hardware in the loop (HIL)
experiments on a real AUV survey in a kelp farm. The framework and dataset can

Conclusion: 该方法通过地形感知优化显著减少了位姿漂移，提升了机器人定位精度。

Abstract: An accurate odometry is essential for legged-wheel robots operating in
unstructured terrains such as bumpy roads and staircases. Existing methods
often suffer from pose drift due to their ignorance of terrain geometry. We
propose a terrain-awared LiDAR-Inertial odometry (LIO) framework that
approximates the terrain using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) whose centers are
adaptively selected and weights are recursively updated. The resulting smooth
terrain manifold enables ``soft constraints" that regularize the odometry
optimization and mitigates the $z$-axis pose drift under abrupt elevation
changes during robot's maneuver. To ensure the LIO's real-time performance, we
further evaluate the RBF-related terms and calculate the inverse of the sparse
kernel matrix with GPU parallelization. Experiments on unstructured terrains
demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy than the
state-of-the-art baselines, especially in the scenarios that have continuous
height changes or sparse features when abrupt height changes occur.

Conclusion: ISyHand展示了低成本、高灵巧性的可行性，其关节式手掌设计为机器人手的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid increase in the development of humanoid robots and customized
manufacturing solutions has brought dexterous manipulation to the forefront of
modern robotics. Over the past decade, several expensive dexterous hands have
come to market, but advances in hardware design, particularly in servo motors
and 3D printing, have recently facilitated an explosion of cheaper open-source
hands. Most hands are anthropomorphic to allow use of standard human tools, and
attempts to increase dexterity often sacrifice anthropomorphism. We introduce
the open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost,
easy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses
off-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be
assembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD.
The ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with
only a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the utility of the
articulated palm, we use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand
to perform a classical in-hand manipulation task: cube reorientation. Our
novel, systematic experiments show that the simulated ISyHand outperforms the
two most comparable hands in early training phases, that all three perform
similarly well after policy convergence, and that the ISyHand significantly
outperforms a fixed-palm version of its own design. Additionally, we deploy a
policy trained on cube reorientation on the real hand, demonstrating its
ability to perform real-world dexterous manipulation.

Motivation: 机器人操作中超出分布的状态通常会导致不可预测的行为或任务失败，增加了风险和损伤的可能性。研究旨在通过异常检测技术，提升机器人操作的可靠性和适应性。

Method: 研究采用了多种基于自编码器的异常检测方法，并通过三种工业机器人任务（电缆铺设、拧螺丝和打磨）的时间序列数据进行测试。数据包括力/力矩信号等，以捕捉机器人与环境交互的特征。

Result: 在电缆铺设和拧螺丝任务中，异常检测的AUROC超过0.93，能有效识别错误零件或目标阻塞等问题。但对于打磨任务，仅能可靠检测严重故障。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于时间序列的异常检测方法在复杂任务中具有潜力，尤其是在数据效率和控制策略通用性方面表现良好，但对细微故障的检测仍需改进。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable
robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of
damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns
in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery
strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in
specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and
task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as
force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment
interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their
broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high
temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely
signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the
same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency.
We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies.
Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and
multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are
compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion
policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the
integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation
from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data
efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust
detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in
failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned
parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were
reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments
remain challenging for multi-robot systems (MRS). Traditional approaches often
rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot
coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot

heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object
search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier
cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g.,
GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared
environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance
compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners,
achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in
large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural
language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide

*Eric R. Damm,Thomas M. Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了移动地面机器人在未知环境中运动规划的问题，提出了三种历史模型追踪方法（PEH、GEH、GEGRH），并比较了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传感器噪声和算法限制导致的障碍物识别不一致问题，提升运动规划的安全性和效率。

Method: 1. PEH：在节点扩展时进行子搜索；2. GEH和GEGRH：延迟子搜索至目标区域，GEGRH额外修正图节点。

Result: GEGRH能生成更低成本轨迹且规划时间更短，优于VEH方法；相比单假设（SH）搜索，规划更保守且时间略有增加。

Conclusion: GEGRH在实际环境中表现更优，适用于实时性要求的场景。

Abstract: Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on
sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios,
consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult
due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for
motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to
overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as
obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential
solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for
the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a
history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world
models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to
reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major
iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search
for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world
models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,
defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH
uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each
world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic
solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than
one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of
results from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a
Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost
trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to
single-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered,
GEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average
planning time.

TL;DR: SDA-PLANNER提出了一种自适应规划方法，通过状态依赖图处理动作约束，并通过错误自适应策略改进执行效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划器存在固定范式、缺乏动作序列约束和错误无视的问题，需要改进。

Method: 引入状态依赖图建模动作约束，采用错误回溯和自适应子树生成策略进行动态调整。

Result: 实验表明SDA-PLANNER在成功率及目标完成上优于基线，尤其在错误场景下。

Conclusion: SDA-PLANNER通过自适应机制显著提升了本体任务规划的效果。

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了FBGA算法，用于在满足通用加速度约束的条件下计算时间最优速度剖面，算法高效且精准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么计算成本高，要么保守的约束效率低，无法满足自动驾驶赛车等高动态环境的需求。

Method: FBGA通过前向后向算法在离散化路径段上最大化速度剖面，同时满足用户定义的性能限制。

Result: 测试表明FBGA在复杂非凸加速度约束下表现优异，与最优控制基准接近，计算速度快三个数量级。

Conclusion: FBGA是一种高效、精准的算法，适合在线多查询轨迹规划。

Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths,
subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot
trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However,
the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high
computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational
efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward
algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which
achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and
backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path
segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five
racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex
acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times
closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being
up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with
coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory
planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at:

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过解耦机器人运动引起的摄像头旋转，可以减少VR晕动症并提高用户体验，且不影响任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在真实摄像头的360°视频流中，解耦机器人旋转是否能减少VR晕动症并提高用户舒适度。

Method: 通过用户研究（n=36）比较解耦旋转与耦合旋转方法，使用全景摄像头和机械臂完成三维任务。

Result: 用户认为解耦旋转更舒适且偏好使用，同时VR晕动症减少且任务表现未受显著影响。

Conclusion: 解耦机器人旋转可有效提升沉浸式远程临场感的舒适度，适用于真实环境。

Abstract: Immersive telepresence, when a user views the video stream of a $360^\circ$
camera in a remote environment using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), has great
potential to improve the sense of being in a remote environment. In most cases
of immersive robotic telepresence, the camera is mounted on a mobile robot
which increases the portion of the environment that the remote user can
explore. However, robot motions can induce unpleasant symptoms associated with
Virtual Reality (VR) sickness, degrading the overall user experience. Previous
research has shown that unwinding the rotations of the robot, that is,
decoupling the rotations that the camera undergoes due to robot motions from
what is seen by the user, can increase user comfort and reduce VR sickness.
However, that work considered a virtual environment and a simulated robot. In
this work, to test whether the same hypotheses hold when the video stream from
a real camera is used, we carried out a user study $(n=36)$ in which the
unwinding rotations method was compared against coupled rotations in a task
completed through a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm. Furthermore,
within an inspection task which involved translations and rotations in three
dimensions, we tested whether unwinding the robot rotations impacted the
performance of users. The results show that the users found the unwinding
rotations method to be more comfortable and preferable, and that a reduced
level of VR sickness can be achieved without a significant impact on task
performance.

Result: 通过数值实验验证了方法的性能，展示了与其他基线方法相比的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效解决了优化过程中非穿透约束的计算问题，适用于碰撞感知轨迹优化等实际应用。

Abstract: Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse
solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the
presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing
non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and
computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based
methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a
method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing
optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems
like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable
conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision
between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to
approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several
numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and
compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the
literature.

Conclusion: LfH-CP为动态障碍物数据集生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets to learn motion planning in
environments with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of
possible obstacle trajectories. Inspired by hallucination-based data synthesis
approaches, we propose Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points (LfH-CP), a
self-supervised framework for creating rich dynamic obstacle datasets based on
existing optimal motion plans without requiring expensive expert demonstrations
or trial-and-error exploration. LfH-CP factorizes hallucination into two
stages: first identifying when and where obstacles must appear in order to
result in an optimal motion plan, i.e., the critical points, and then
procedurally generating diverse trajectories that pass through these points
while avoiding collisions. This factorization avoids generative failures such
as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors. We further
introduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that LfH-CP
produces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines.
Experiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on LfH-CP datasets
achieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination method.

Abstract: Mean-shift-based approaches have recently emerged as the most effective
methods for robot swarm shape assembly tasks. These methods rely on image-based
representations of target shapes to compute local density gradients and perform
mean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such
image representations incur substantial memory overhead, which can become
prohibitive for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a memory-efficient tree map representation that hierarchically encodes
user-specified shapes and is applicable to both 2D and 3D scenarios. Building
on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller that
enables assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations
against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm demonstrate one to two orders
of magnitude lower memory usage and two to three times faster shape entry while
maintaining comparable uniformity. Finally, we validate the framework through
physical experiments with 6 to 7 UAVs, confirming its real-world practicality.

Abstract: Radio-based methods such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and RAdio Detection And
Ranging (radar), which have traditionally seen limited adoption in robotics,
are experiencing a boost in popularity thanks to their robustness to harsh
environmental conditions and cluttered environments. This work proposes a
multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies
with inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement
Units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial
robot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline
includes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the
aerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with
loosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot
scenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative
transformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and
inter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating
System (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in
Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The
proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form
methods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom
Gazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real
data. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system
readily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).
Finally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support
reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.

maintaining generality and using less memory. We also apply Graphite to global
visual-inertial bundle adjustment on maps generated from stereo-inertial SLAM

results indicate that our solver enables faster large-scale optimization on
both desktop and resource-constrained devices.

Motivation: 现有的人形机器人运动重定向方法存在物理不自然（如脚滑、穿透）和忽视关键交互的问题，OmniRetarget旨在通过建模和保持交互关系来解决这些问题。

Method: OmniRetarget基于交互网格显式建模代理、地形和物体的空间与接触关系，并通过最小化Laplacian变形和满足运动学约束生成可行轨迹。

Conclusion: OmniRetarget成功解决了运动重定向的关键问题，支持长时程任务的执行，为机器人技能训练提供了高效且高质量的数据生成方法。

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to
retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning
(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the
significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically
implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,
common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment
interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To
address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data
generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and
preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the
terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation
between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,
OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,
preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from
a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object
configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions
from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour
trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact
preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables
proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30
seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained
with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,
without any learning curriculum.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言动作模型（VLA）主要关注视觉和语言的解释生成动作，但忽视了机器人需要感知和交互的空间物理世界信息，从而限制了复杂和接触丰富的控制能力。

Method: 提出了一种无编码器的多模态对齐方案，利用大型语言模型直接解释多模态线索（如2D图像、3D点云和触觉标记）；同时设计了未来多感官生成后训练策略，增强对物理动态的理解。

Result: MLA模型在复杂且接触密集的真实任务中，比之前最先进的2D和3D VLA方法分别提升了12%和24%的性能，并显示出更好的对未见配置的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MLA模型通过多感官信息的综合理解，显著提升了机器人在复杂任务中的性能，为未来机器人控制提供了一个更强大的框架。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities
in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs)
and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision
and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact
within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a
comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which
is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we
introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively
perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory
objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance
perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment
scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a
perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,
3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To
further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future
multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about
semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust
conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,
contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved
generalization to unseen configurations. Project website:

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world

extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh

state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed

transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

*Yuyang Liu,Chuan Wen,Yihang Hu,Dinesh Jayaraman,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种通过视频学习任务进展信号的奖励学习方法，显著提升了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计密集奖励信号通常需要大量手动工作且难以扩展，任务是探索如何利用任务进展作为密集奖励信号。

Method: TimeRewarder通过建模视频帧间的时间距离，从被动视频（如机器人演示和人类视频）中学习进展信号，并提供逐步奖励指导RL。

Result: 在十个Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder表现出色，9/10任务接近完美成功，且样本效率优于手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder是一种可扩展的方法，能够从多样视频源中获得丰富的奖励信号。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

*Wontaek Kim,Tianyu Li,Sehoon Ha*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: MoReFlow是一个无监督动作重定向框架，通过流匹配学习不同角色动作嵌入空间的对应关系，无需配对数据即可实现高质量动作重定向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作重定向方法依赖手工约束或配对数据集，适用范围有限且忽视了特定领域目标（如动画风格保留或机器人任务空间对齐）。

Method: MoReFlow分为两阶段：1）使用VQ-VAE训练每个角色的标记化动作嵌入；2）通过条件耦合的流匹配对齐潜在空间。

Result: 实验表明，MoReFlow在多样化角色和任务中生成高质量动作，相比基线方法具有更好的可控性、泛化性和动作真实感。

Conclusion: MoReFlow提供了一种灵活且可逆的动作重定向方法，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Motion retargeting holds a premise of offering a larger set of motion data
for characters and robots with different morphologies. Many prior works have
approached this problem via either handcrafted constraints or paired motion
datasets, limiting their applicability to humanoid characters or narrow
behaviors such as locomotion. Moreover, they often assume a fixed notion of
retargeting, overlooking domain-specific objectives like style preservation in
animation or task-space alignment in robotics. In this work, we propose
MoReFlow, Motion Retargeting via Flow Matching, an unsupervised framework that
learns correspondences between characters' motion embedding spaces. Our method
consists of two stages. First, we train tokenized motion embeddings for each
character using a VQ-VAE, yielding compact latent representations. Then, we
employ flow matching with conditional coupling to align the latent spaces
across characters, which simultaneously learns conditioned and unconditioned
matching to achieve robust but flexible retargeting. Once trained, MoReFlow
enables flexible and reversible retargeting without requiring paired data.
Experiments demonstrate that MoReFlow produces high-quality motions across
diverse characters and tasks, offering improved controllability,
generalization, and motion realism compared to the baselines.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了毫米波网络中基于IRS的最大化用户保密率问题，通过松弛相位偏移和分解优化问题，提出了一种低复杂度的映射算法，证明了算法的收敛性和优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保用户在毫米波网络中的公平保密率，解决混合整数优化问题和非凸性挑战。

Method: 采用罚函数法和块坐标下降法分解问题，结合连续凸逼近(SCA)求解，并设计低复杂度映射算法。

Result: 算法在收敛性和保密率上优于传统半定规划(SDP)方法，特别是在多IRS和大相位偏移情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效解决了毫米波网络中用户保密率的优化问题，证明了其收敛性和计算效率。

Abstract: We study the secrecy rate maximization problem in a millimeter wave (mmWave)
network, consisting of a base station (BS), multiple intelligent reflecting
surfaces (IRSs) (or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)), multiple
users, and a single eavesdropper. To ensure a fair secrecy rate among all the
users, we adopt a max-min fairness criterion which results in a mixed integer
problem. We first relax discrete IRSs phase shifts to the continuous ones. To
cope with the non-convexity of the relaxed optimization problem, we leverage
the penalty method and block coordinate descent approach to divide it into two
sub-problems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Then,
we propose a low-complexity mapping algorithm where feasible IRSs phase shifts
are obtained. Mathematical evaluation shows the convergence of sub-problems to
a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original ones. Furthermore, the
convergence guarantee of the overall proposed algorithm and computational
complexity are investigated. Finally, simulation results show our proposed
algorithm outweighs the conventional solutions based on the semi-definite
programming (SDP) in terms of convergence and secrecy rate, especially in a
larger number of IRSs and phase shifts where SDP suffers from rank-one
approximation. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and IRS-free systems are also
considered as other benchmarks.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Capacity-Net的无监督学习方法，旨在最大化RIS辅助的毫米波MIMO系统中的可达到速率，避免了传统方法对完整CSI的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于毫米波频谱的严重信道衰减和RIS主要由无源组件组成导致完整CSI获取困难，需要一种无需依赖CSI的优化方法。

Method: 通过无监督学习技术，利用接收到的导频信号提供隐式CSI，建立导频信号、优化的RIS相位偏移和可达到速率之间的映射关系。

Result: 仿真结果表明，Capacity-Net的性能优于基于传统信道估计的学习方法。

Conclusion: Capacity-Net为RIS辅助的毫米波MIMO系统提供了一种有效的无监督学习解决方案，减少了对CSI的依赖。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning
approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent
surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we
optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to
enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily
on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often
challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components.
To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with
implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually
requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of
the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of
channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among
the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant
achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning
methods based on traditional channel estimation.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个基于深度确定性策略梯度（DDPG）的深度强化学习框架，用于优化多RIS辅助的多用户下行链路系统的频谱效率，考虑了RIS反射幅度与相位偏移之间的实际耦合效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常假设RIS具有理想的反射特性，而忽略了反射幅度与相位偏移之间的实际耦合效应，导致优化问题复杂化。

Method: 采用DDPG框架优化发射器预编码和RIS相位偏移矩阵，以在毫米波信道环境下最大化频谱效率。

Result: 仿真结果表明，尽管复杂度高，但所提出的DDPG方法显著优于基于优化的算法和双深度Q学习，尤其是在随机用户分布场景中。

Conclusion: DDPG方法在多RIS辅助系统中表现出色，能够有效处理因实际耦合效应导致的非凸优化问题。

Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the
transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum
efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical
coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for
the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address
this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated
under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel
settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the
proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms
and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管极坐标下可实现全局渐近稳定，但缺乏模块化设计框架，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用模块化设计方法，构建双向平滑反馈律和严格CLF，支持高效停车操作和全局稳定性。

Result: 证明了反馈律的全局渐近稳定性，并提供显式收敛速率，同时通过CLF变体实现“几乎全局”稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了极坐标下的稳定控制性能，还为后续优化设计（如成本函数和无限增益裕度）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Since the mid-1990s, it has been known that, unlike in Cartesian form where
Brockett's condition rules out static feedback stabilization, the unicycle is
globally asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback in polar coordinates.
In this note, we introduce a modular framework for designing smooth feedback
laws that achieve global asymptotic stabilization in polar coordinates. These
laws are bidirectional, enabling efficient parking maneuvers, and are paired
with families of strict control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) constructed in a
modular fashion. The resulting CLFs guarantee global asymptotic stability with
explicit convergence rates and include barrier variants that yield "almost
global" stabilization, excluding only zero-measure subsets of the rotation
manifolds. The strictness of the CLFs is further leveraged in our companion
paper, where we develop inverse-optimal redesigns with meaningful cost
functions and infinite gain margins.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过反向步进和积分前馈技术，为极坐标下的独轮车稳定问题设计新的平滑转向律，并扩展控制Lyapunov函数的应用范围。

Method: 利用反向步进和积分前馈技术，构建平滑转向律和控制Lyapunov函数。

Conclusion: 研究表明反向步进和积分前馈技术在解决独轮车和Dubins车停车问题时具有本质联系，为最优控制设计提供了更多可能。

Abstract: In a companion paper, we present a modular framework for unicycle
stabilization in polar coordinates that provides smooth steering laws through
backstepping. Surprisingly, the same problem also allows the application of
integrator forwarding. In this work, we leverage this feature and construct new
smooth steering laws together with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), expanding
the set of CLFs available for inverse optimal control design. In the case of
constant forward velocity (Dubins car), backstepping produces finite-time
(deadbeat) parking, and we show that integrator forwarding yields the very same
class of solutions. This reveals a fundamental connection between backstepping
and forwarding in addressing both the unicycle and, the Dubins car parking
problems.

Conclusion: 提出的抢占式协同汇合控制策略在驾驶稳定性和整体交通效率优化方面表现出显著优势，显著提升了汇合区的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization
efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on
the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the
perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of
safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively
analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the
mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal
trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving
heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving
intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence
strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under
different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow
and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the
time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the
dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average
speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively
evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence
control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement
rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The
proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and
emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and
show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency
optimization.

Result: YOLOv9结合ConSinGAN的效果最佳，准确率达91.3%，检测时间为146毫秒，并成功集成到AOI系统中。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了缺陷检测性能，并易于推广至其他工业制造场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

Motivation: 从用户的移动轨迹重建房间布局是一个病态问题，因为多种布局可能对应相同的轨迹。现有的生成逆解方法在路径规划的非可逆性和非可微性上面临挑战。

Method: 采用对比损失训练嵌入空间，使兼容的布局和轨迹在空间中接近，不兼容的远离。在此基础上定义了近似似然分数，指导扩散过程。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入空间的平滑重构，论文提供了一种有效的逆问题求解框架，适用于非可微问题的后验采样。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup

template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth

the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新数据集和基准评测，用于评估视觉-惯性SLAM在穿戴式设备上的表现，解决了现有基准评测不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SLAM研究缺乏能反映穿戴式设备特有挑战的数据集，如多样运动、动态内容、长时校准变化等。

Method: 通过配备多种传感器的眼镜设备在城市中心记录数据，利用测量工具获取厘米级精度的间接位姿标注。

Result: 实验表明，现有SLAM系统在面对这些挑战时表现不佳，并识别了导致问题的组件。

Conclusion: 新数据集为SLAM研究提供了更真实的评估环境，支持对不成熟方法的深入分析。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无导数方法、序列凸规划的轨迹优化统一框架，适用于动力学难以求导的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统泰勒展开方法在动力学难以求导或代价高昂时的局限性。

Result: 框架灵活，支持多阶段射击和通用约束，适用于多种运动规划和控制问题。

Conclusion: 该框架简化了无导数优化，扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: We present a unified framework for solving trajectory optimization problems
in a derivative-free manner through the use of sequential convex programming.
Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and
solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and
constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions.
This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or
unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these
convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and
constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our
framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like
model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes
them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and
inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based
sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple,
flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning
and control problems.

*Yanan Zhao,Feng Ji,Xingchao Jian,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图信号处理（GSP）框架，将信号建模为Wasserstein空间中的图分布值信号（GDS），克服了传统向量方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GSP方法假设顶点同步观测、无法捕捉不确定性且需要严格的图滤波对应关系，限制了其在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 通过将信号表示为概率分布，GDS框架自然地编码了不确定性和随机性，同时推广了传统图信号的定义。

Result: 实验验证了该框架在图滤波学习任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: GDS框架提供了更具灵活性和鲁棒性的GSP方法，适用于现实世界中的不确定性场景。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for graph signal processing (GSP) that models
signals as graph distribution-valued signals (GDSs), which are probability
distributions in the Wasserstein space. This approach overcomes key limitations
of classical vector-based GSP, including the assumption of synchronous
observations over vertices, the inability to capture uncertainty, and the
requirement for strict correspondence in graph filtering. By representing
signals as distributions, GDSs naturally encode uncertainty and stochasticity,
while strictly generalizing traditional graph signals. We establish a
systematic dictionary mapping core GSP concepts to their GDS counterparts,
demonstrating that classical definitions are recovered as special cases. The
effectiveness of the framework is validated through graph filter learning for
prediction tasks, supported by experimental results.

Motivation: 解决多元时间序列中异常检测的挑战，通过分区保留变量间的相关性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了异常检测性能。

Conclusion: PARADISE方法通过分区和局部检测策略，有效提高了多元时间序列异常检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

Method: 采用DRL框架（PPO和TD3）联合优化传输功率、带宽和调度，并通过多目标奖励平衡吞吐量、能效和公平性。

Result: DRL框架在动态网络资源分配中表现优于三种启发式算法。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了未来异构无线网络中DRL设计的关键权衡。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is
challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel
conditions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that
jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a
multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness.
Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three
heuristic algorithms in multiple network scenarios. Our results show that DRL
frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in
dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for
future HetNets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用视觉语言模型（VLM）生成伪标签的方法，解决时间序列问答（TSQA）任务中缺乏标注数据的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 时间序列问答任务面临标注数据不足的挑战，而大规模视觉语言模型在零样本情况下展示了分析时间序列信号的潜力。

Method: 通过VLM生成的伪标签（可能存在错误）训练TSQA模型，利用深度神经网络对噪声标签的鲁棒性进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，TSQA模型不仅能通过伪标签成功训练，还能借助大量未标注数据超越VLM的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了TSQA任务中数据标注不足的问题，展示了伪标签和深度神经网络鲁棒性的结合优势。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

Motivation: 自主机械取栓手术导航因血管解剖复杂性和实时决策需求而具挑战性。

Method: 使用TD-MPC2算法训练单一RL代理，在10例患者血管中进行多任务学习。

Result: TD-MPC2成功率65%，优于SAC的37%，但手术时间更长。

Conclusion: 世界模型可提升自主血管内导航性能，为通用AI驱动机器人干预奠定基础。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对返回目标（RTG）和成本目标（CTG）使用对称输入标记，忽略了其本质不对称性，导致约束满足不可靠。

Method: 提出Boundary-to-Region（B2R）框架，通过成本信号重对齐实现不对称条件化，并结合旋转位置嵌入增强安全区域探索。

Conclusion: B2R揭示了对称标记条件化的局限性，并为序列模型在安全强化学习中的应用提供了理论和实践新方法。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Motivation: 随着无线充电普及，公共场合的能量访问保护和网络安全日益重要，但现有加密方法不可靠。

Method: 优化攻击系统，取消耗时步骤并使用主接收线圈检测磁场。

Result: 通过仿真和实验证明攻击速度快（0.2毫秒），窃取65%电能，硬件更简单。

Conclusion: 现有加密方法需改进，能量访问保护需高度重视。

Abstract: With the popularity of wireless charging, energy access protection and
cybersecurity are gaining importance, especially in public places. Currently,
the most common energy encryption method uses frequency and associated
impedance variation. However, we have proven that this method is not reliable,
since a hacker can detect the changing frequency and adjust the compensation.
However, the previously presented system needed time to follow the updated
frequency, while encryption systems may vary the frequency faster to avoid
energy theft. Furthermore, the previous system required an additional sensor
coil. To solve these problems, we optimized the attack and the associated
system, which can intrude and steal energy within 0.2 ms. The key is the
elimination of the time-consuming maximum receiver current regulation. Also, we
use the main receiving coil rather than any additional sensor antenna to detect
the magnetic field. Thus, the new hardware is even simpler. A simulation model
and experimental results demonstrate the fast response speed of the attack on
encrypted wireless power and steal 65% of the power. Overall, the applicability
of the attack is highly improved and leaves less room for hardening the
encryption. The results demonstrate that energy access protection needs to be
given great attention.
