These challenges pose significant\ndifficulties for classical channel estimation algorithms like least squares\n(LS) and maximum a posteriori (MAP). To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel environment-aware channel estimation framework with location-specific\nprior channel distribution enabled by the new concept of channel knowledge map\n(CKM). To this end, we propose a new type of CKM called channel score function\nmap (CSFM), which learns the channel probability density function (PDF) using\nartificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To fully exploit the prior information\nin CSFM, we propose a plug-and-play (PnP) based algorithm to decouple the\nregularized MAP channel estimation problem, thereby reducing the complexity of\nthe optimization process. Besides, we employ Tweedie's formula to establish a\nconnection between the channel score function, defined as the logarithmic\ngradient of the channel PDF, and the channel denoiser. This allows the use of\nthe high-precision, environment-aware channel denoiser from the CSFM to\napproximate the channel score function, thus enabling efficient processing of\nthe decoupled channel statistical components.

In\nparticular, we show that image-space preconditioning (ISP) and data-space\npreconditioning (DSP) can be formulated as non-conventional inner-products. The\nmain gain of our reformulation is an embedding of ISP in the variational\nformulation of the MRI reconstruction problem (in an algorithm-independent way)\nwhich allows in principle to naturally and systematically propagate ISP in all\niterative reconstructions, including many iterative DL and CS reconstructions\nwhere preconditioning is lacking. The way in which we apply linear algebraic\ntools to MRI reconstructions as presented in this article is a novelty.\n  A secondary aim of our article is to offer a certain didactic material to\nscientists who are new in the field of MRI reconstruction. Since we explore\nhere some mathematical concepts of reconstruction, we take that opportunity to\nrecall some principles that may be understood for experts, but which may be\nhard to find in the literature for beginners. In fact, the description of many\nmathematical tools of MRI reconstruction is fragmented in the literature or\nsometimes missing because considered as a general knowledge. Further, some of\nthose concepts can be found in mathematic manuals, but not in a form that is\noriented toward MRI. For example, we think of the conjugate gradient descent,\nthe notion of derivative with respect to non-conventional inner products, or\nsimply the notion of adjoint. The authors believe therefore that it is\nbeneficial for their field of research to dedicate some space to such a\ndidactic material."}

We\nhave assumed that the auditory pathway - which transmits envelope components of\nspeech and music to the scalp through time-varying neurophysiological processes\n- is a linear time-varying system, with the envelope and the multi-channel EEG\nresponses as excitation and response, respectively. This paper investigates the\ntransfer function of this system through two analytical techniques -\ntime-averaged spectral responses and cross-spectral density - in the frequency\ndomain at four different positions of the human scalp. Our findings suggest\nthat alpha (8-11 Hz), lower gamma (53-56 Hz), and higher gamma (78-81 Hz) bands\nare the peak responses of the system. These frequently appearing dominant\nfrequency responses may be the key components of familiar speech perception,\nmaintaining attention, binding acoustic features, and memory processing. The\ncross-spectral density, which reflects the spatial neural coherence of the\nhuman brain, shows that 10-13 Hz, 27-29 Hz, and 62-64 Hz are common for all\nchannel pairs. As neural coherences are frequently observed in these\nfrequencies among native participants, we suggest that these distributed neural\nprocesses are also dominant in native speech and music perception."}

In\ncontrast, movable antennas (MAs) offer a flexible solution by enabling channel\nreconstruction through antenna movement, effectively compensating for the\nlimitations of FPAs. In this paper, we aim to derive a closed-form expression\nfor the secrecy rate, a key metric in PLS, which is often unattainable in\ncurrent studies due to the uncertainty of Eves. We construct an equivalent\nmodel that leverages the reconfigurable nature of MAs, equating the secrecy\nrates obtained by multiple Eves with single FPAs to those achieved by a single\nvirtual Eve equipped with an MA array.
