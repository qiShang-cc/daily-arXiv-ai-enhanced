However, mmWave signals suffer from their inherent characteristics\nsuch as severe path loss, poor scattering, and limited diffraction, which\nnecessitate the use of large antenna arrays and directional beamforming,\ntypically implemented through massive MIMO architectures. Accurate channel\nestimation is critical in such systems, but its computational complexity\nincreases proportionally with the number of antennas. This may become a\nsignificant burden in mmWave systems where channels exhibit rapid fluctuations\nand require frequent updates. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity\nchannel denoiser based on Bayesian binary hypothesis testing and beamspace\nsparsity. By modeling each sparse beamspace component as a mixture of signal\nand noise under a Bernoulli-complex Gaussian prior, we formulate a likelihood\nratio test to detect signal-relevant elements. Then, a hard-thresholding rule\nis applied to suppress noise-dominant components in the noisy channel vector.\nDespite its extremely low computational complexity, the proposed method\nachieves channel estimation accuracy that is comparable to that of complex\niterative or learning-based approaches. This effectiveness is supported by both\ntheoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, suggesting that the method can\nbe a viable option for mmWave systems with strict resource constraints."}

The source and destination both have energy harvesting\n(EH) capability with limited battery capacity. Due to the Markov nature of the\nsystem, the problem is formulated as a finite-horizon reinforcement learning\n(RL) problem. We propose the finite-horizon joint power allocation (FHJPA)\nalgorithm for the finite-horizon RL problem and compare it with a\nlow-complexity greedy algorithm (GA). An infinite-horizon joint power\nallocation (IHJPA) algorithm is also proposed for the corresponding\ninfinite-horizon problem. A comparative analysis of these algorithms is carried\nout in terms of SEE, expected total transmitted secure bits, and computational\ncomplexity. The results show that the FHJPA algorithm outperforms the GA and\nIHJPA algorithms due to its appropriate modelling in finite horizon\ntransmission. When the source node battery has sufficient energy, the GA can\nyield performance close to the FHJPA algorithm despite its low-complexity. When\nthe transmission time horizon increases, the accuracy of the infinite-horizon\nmodel improves, resulting in a reduced performance gap between FHJPA and IHJPA\nalgorithms.

We consider a secure\ntransmission scenario where an airborne transmitter communicates with multiple\nlegitimate users in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. To ensure\nsecurity, zero-forcing beamforming is employed to nullify signal leakage toward\neavesdroppers.

How these\nmodes of attention interact and whether their neural underpinnings are distinct\nremains unclear. In this work, we investigate the perceptual and neural\ncorrelates of different attentional modes in a controlled \"cocktail party\"\nparadigm, where listeners listen to the same stimuli and attend to either a\nspatial location (feature-based), a speaker (object-based), or the entire scene\n(global or free-listening) while detecting deviations in pitch of a voice in\nthe scene.
