Instead, we explore a\nnovel multi-user downlink communication system that leverages a UAV-mounted\nSTAR-RIS (Aerial-STAR) incorporating a coupled TRC phase shift model. Our key\ncontributions include the joint optimization of UAV trajectory, active\nbeamforming vectors at the base station, and passive RIS TRCs to enhance\ncommunication efficiency, while considering UAV energy constraints. We design\nthe TRC as a combination of discrete and continuous actions, and propose a\nnovel Dual Actor Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DA-DDPG) algorithm. The\nalgorithm relies on two separate actor networks for high-dimensional hybrid\naction space. We also propose a novel harmonic mean index (HFI)-based reward\nfunction to ensure communication fairness amongst users. For comprehensive\nanalysis, we study the impact of RIS size on UAV aerodynamics showing that it\nincreases drag and energy demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed DA-DDPG algorithm outperforms conventional DDPG and DQN-based\nsolutions by 24% and 97%, respectively, in accumulated reward.\nThree-dimensional UAV trajectory optimization achieves 28% higher communication\nefficiency compared to two-dimensional and altitude optimization. The HFI based\nreward function provides 41% lower QoS denial rates as compared to other\nbenchmarks. The mobile Aerial-STAR system shows superior performance over fixed\ndeployed counterparts, with the coupled phase STAR-RIS outperforming dual\nTransmit/Reflect RIS and conventional RIS setups. These findings highlight the\npotential of Aerial-STAR systems and the effectiveness of our proposed DA-DDPG\napproach in optimizing their performance."}

Although PDDL is a\nwidely adopted standard in robotic planning, manually designing domains for\ndiverse applications such as surveillance, delivery, and inspection is\nlabor-intensive and error-prone, which hinders adoption and real-world\ndeployment. To address these challenges, we propose SPAR, a framework that\nleverages the generative capabilities of LLMs to automatically produce valid,\ndiverse, and semantically accurate PDDL domains from natural language input. To\nthis end, we first introduce a systematically formulated and validated UAV\nplanning dataset, consisting of ground-truth PDDL domains and associated\nproblems, each paired with detailed domain and action descriptions. Building on\nthis dataset, we design a prompting framework that generates high-quality PDDL\ndomains from language input.
