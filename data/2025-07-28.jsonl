The LUTs emulate the spectral effects of\npre-quantization dithering through an all-digital solution applied after\nquantization. This methodology decomposes the intractable LUT design problem\ninto four distinct stages, each of which is addressed analytically using a\nmodel-driven approach without reliance on training. Three dithering methods are\nstudied to improve spectral purity metrics. Two novel indexing schemes are\nproposed to limit the LUT memory overhead shown to compress the LUT size by\nover four orders of magnitude with marginal performance loss. The LUT design is\ntested with an oversampled noisy sinusoidal input quantized to 3 bits and shown\nto improve its Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) by over 19 dBc with only 324\nbytes of memory while maintaining the same 3-bit fixed-point precision at the\ndigital output. This correction can be implemented using two-level\ncombinational logic ensuring ultra-low latency and, hence, suitable for\nlow-resolution wideband devices."}

This study evaluates the reliability and validity of a novel\nBalance Mat (BM) device, a low-cost portable alternative that uses optical\nfibre technology. The research includes two studies: a robot study and a human\nstudy. In the robot study, a UR10 robotic arm was used to obtain controlled\nsway patterns to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the BM. In the human\nstudy, 51 healthy young participants performed balance tasks on the BM in\ncombination with an FP to evaluate the BM's validity. Sway metrics such as sway\nmean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range,\nand sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared. Reliability\nwas evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), where values\ngreater than 0.9 were considered excellent and values between 0.75 and 0.9 were\nconsidered good. Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent\nICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed\nmoderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman\nplots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the\nFP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP.
