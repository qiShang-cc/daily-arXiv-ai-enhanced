RAA is composed of massive cheap antenna elements and a\nfew radio frequency (RF) chains. The massive antenna elements are arranged in a\nnovel ray-like structure, with each ray corresponding to a simple uniform\nlinear array (sULA) with a carefully designed orientation. The antenna elements\nof each sULA are directly connected to an RF combiner, so that the sULA in each\nray is able to form a beam towards a direction matching the ray orientation\nwithout relying on any analog or digital beamforming. By further designing a\nray selection network (RSN), appropriate sULAs are selected to connect to the\nRF chains for further baseband processing. Compared to conventional\nmulti-antenna architectures like hybrid analog/digital beamforming (HBF), the\nproposed RAA has two major advantages. First, it can significantly reduce\nhardware costs since no phase shifters, which are usually expensive especially\nin high-frequency systems, are required. Besides, RAA can greatly improve\nsystem performance by configuring antenna elements with higher directionality,\nas each sULA only needs to be responsible for a portion of the total coverage\nangle. To demonstrate such advantages, in this paper, we first present the\ninput-output model for RAA-based wireless communications, based on which the\nray orientations of the RAA are designed. Furthermore, efficient algorithms for\njoint ray selection and beamforming are proposed for single-user and multi-user\nRAA-based wireless communications. Simulation results demonstrate the superior\nperformance of RAA compared to HBF while significantly reducing hardware cost."}

The RF\nsignals are processed through the designed filter banks, and the frequency\ndomain parameters of bounding boxes generated by the detector are corrected\nwith transmission frequency and signal bandwidth. Given the remarkable\ncorrelation characteristics of ZC sequences, the frequency domain parameters of\nbounding boxes with low confidence scores are corrected based on ZC sequences\nand frame length, which improves the detection accuracy of dim targets under\nlow signal-to noise ratio (SNR) situations. Besides, a segmented energy\nrefinement method is applied to mitigate the deviation caused by interference\nsignals with high energy strength, which ulteriorly corrects the time domain\ndetection parameters for dim targets. As the sampling duration increases, the\ndetection speed improves while the detection accuracy of broadcast frames\ntermed as small targets decreases.

In this paper,\nwe propose a self-supervised learning-based semantic communication framework\n(SLSCom) to enhance task inference performance, particularly in scenarios with\nlimited access to labeled samples. Specifically, we develop a task-relevant\nsemantic encoder using unlabeled samples, which can be collected by devices in\nreal-world edge networks. To facilitate task-relevant semantic extraction, we\nintroduce self-supervision for learning contrastive features and formulate the\ninformation bottleneck (IB) problem to balance the tradeoff between the\ninformativeness of the extracted features and task inference performance. Given\nthe computational challenges of the IB problem, we devise a practical and\neffective solution by employing self-supervised classification and\nreconstruction pretext tasks. We further propose efficient joint training\nmethods to enhance end-to-end inference accuracy over wireless channels, even\nwith few labeled samples. We evaluate the proposed framework on image\nclassification tasks over multipath wireless channels. Extensive simulation\nresults demonstrate that SLSCom significantly outperforms conventional digital\ncoding methods and existing DL-based approaches across varying labeled data set\nsizes and SNR conditions, even when the unlabeled samples are irrelevant to the\ndownstream tasks."}
