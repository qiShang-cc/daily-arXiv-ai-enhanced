It provides large-scale antenna reconfiguration, establishes stable line-of-sight links, mitigates signal blockage, and exploits near-field advantages through its distinctive architecture. This article aims to present a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in PASS. The fundamental principles of PASS are first discussed, including its hardware architecture, circuit and physical models, and signal models. Several emerging PASS designs, such as segmented PASS (S-PASS), center-fed PASS (C-PASS), and multi-mode PASS (M-PASS), are subsequently introduced, and their design features are discussed. In addition, the properties and promising applications of PASS for wireless sensing are reviewed. On this basis, recent progress in the performance analysis of PASS for both communications and sensing is surveyed, and the performance gains achieved by PASS are highlighted. Existing research contributions in optimization and machine learning are also summarized, with the practical challenges of beamforming and resource allocation being identified in relation to the unique transmission structure and propagation characteristics of PASS. Finally, several variants of PASS are presented, and key implementation challenges that remain open for future study are discussed."}

While data-driven approaches have advanced rapidly, establishing a precise geometric correspondence between ego-centric visual data and radio propagation remains a challenge. Existing paradigms typically either associate 2D topology maps and auxiliary information with radio maps, or provide 3D perspective views limited by sparse radio data. This spatial representation flattens the complex vertical interactions such as occlusion and diffraction that govern signal behavior in urban environments, rendering the task of cross-view signal inference mathematically ill-posed. To resolve this geometric ambiguity, we introduce SynthRM, a scalable synthetic data platform. SynthRM implements a Visible-Aligned-Surface simulation strategy: rather than probing a global volumetric grid, it performs ray-tracing directly onto the geometry exposed to the sensor. This approach ensures pixel-level consistency between visual semantics and electromagnetic response, transforming the learning objective into a physically well-posed problem. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities by presenting a diverse, city-scale dataset derived from procedurally generated environments. By combining efficient procedural synthesis with high-fidelity electromagnetic modeling, SynthRM provides a transparent, accessible foundation for developing next-generation mobile systems for environment-aware sensing and communication."}

While prior work has primarily focused on discrete-valued sequences, we extend the results of Bu et al.

Unlike traditional interference exploitation precoding (IEP) which relies on computational hardware circuitry, we perform the precoding operations within the analog wave domain provided by SIMs. However, the benefits of SIM-enabled IEP are limited by the nonlinear distortion (NLD) caused by power amplifiers. A hardware-efficient interference-free transmitter architecture is developed to exploit SIM's high and flexible degree of freedom (DoF), where the NLD on modulated symbols can be directly compensated in the wave domain. Moreover, we design a frame-level SIM configuration scheme and formulate a maxmin problem on the safety margin function. With respect to the optimization of SIM phase shifts, we propose a recursive oblique manifold (ROM) algorithm to tackle the complex coupling among phase shifts across multiple layers. A flexible DoF-driven antenna selection (AS) scheme is explored in the SIM-enabled IEP system. Using an ROM-based alternating optimization (ROM-AO) framework, our approach jointly optimizes transmit AS, SIM phase shift design, and power allocation (PA), and develops a greedy safety margin-based AS algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed SIM-enabled frame-level IEP scheme significantly outperforms benchmarks. Specifically, the strategy with AS and PA can achieve a 20 dB performance gain compared to the case without any strategy under the 12 dB signal-to-noise ratio, which confirms the superiority of the NLD-aware IEP scheme and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}

To overcome this challenge, we introduce cooperative double-IRS-assisted wideband MIMO-OFDM and propose an efficient manifold-based solution. By regarding the power and constant modulus constraints as Riemannian manifolds, we reformulate the non-convex secrecy sum rate maximization as an unconstrained optimization on a product manifold. Building on this formulation, we further develop a product Riemannian gradient descent (PRGD) algorithm with guaranteed stationary convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively resolves the OFDM coupling issue and achieves significant secrecy rate gains, outperforming single-IRS and distributed multi-IRS benchmarks by 32.0% and 22.3%, respectively."}

To enable fine-grained queue management at the packet level under resource constraints, we formulate a joint optimization problem that simultaneously learns active packet dropping and transmit power control strategies. A hybrid action space is designed to support both discrete dropping decisions and continuous power control. To exploit the graph-structured interference inherent in V2V topology, a graph neural network (GNN) is introduced to aggregate slowly varying large-scale fading, allowing agents to capture topological dependencies implicitly without frequent message exchange. The overall framework is built upon multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces average AoI across a wide range of network densities, channel conditions, and traffic loads, consistently outperforming several baselines."}

In centralized operation, channel estimation and data decoding are performed at the central processing unit (CPU), whereas in distributed operation, channel estimation occurs at the APs and data detection at the CPU.

Unlike frame-based vision systems, the neuromorphic tactile modality directly encodes dynamic contact events during continuous sliding, closely emulating human finger-scanning strategies. Our approach combines spatiotemporal segmentation with a lightweight ResNet-based classifier to process sparse event streams, enabling robust character recognition across varying indentation depths and scanning speeds. The proposed system achieves near-perfect accuracy (>=98%) at standard depths, generalizes across multiple Braille board layouts, and maintains strong performance under fast scanning. On a physical Braille board containing daily-living vocabulary, the system attains over 90% word-level accuracy, demonstrating robustness to temporal compression effects that challenge conventional methods.

Submitted to Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization", "summary": "Soft robotic grippers are essential for grasping delicate, geometrically complex objects in manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture. However, existing grippers struggle to grasp feature-rich objects with high topological variability, including gears with sharp tooth profiles on automotive assembly lines, corals with fragile protrusions, or vegetables with irregular branching structures like broccoli. Unlike simple geometric primitives such as cubes or spheres, feature-rich objects lack a clear \"optimal\" contact surface, making them both difficult to grasp and susceptible to damage when grasped by existing gripper designs. Safe handling of such objects therefore requires specialized soft grippers whose morphology is tailored to the object's features. Topology optimization offers a promising approach for producing specialized grippers, but its utility is limited by the requirement for pre-defined load cases. For soft grippers interacting with feature-rich objects, these loads arise from hundreds of unpredictable gripper-object contact forces during grasping and are unknown a priori. To address this problem, we introduce SimTO, a framework that enables high-resolution topology optimization by automatically extracting load cases from a contact-based physics simulator, eliminating the need for manual load specification. Given an arbitrary feature-rich object, SimTO produces highly customized soft grippers with fine-grained morphological features tailored to the object geometry. Numerical results show our designs are not only highly specialized to feature-rich objects, but also generalize to unseen objects."}

Flocking - coordinated motion through cohesion, alignment, and separation - traditionally assumes uniform desired inter-agent distances. Many practical applications demand greater flexibility, as the diversity of types and configurations grows with the popularity of multi-agent systems in society. Moreover, agents often operate without guarantees of trust or secure communication. Motivated by these challenges we update well-established frameworks by relaxing this assumption of shared inter-agent distances and constraints. Through a new form of constrained collective potential function, we introduce a solution that permits negotiation of these parameters. In the spirit of the traditional flocking control canon, this negotiation is achieved purely through local observations and does not require any global information or inter-agent communication. The approach is robust to semi-trust scenarios, where neighbouring agents pursue conflicting goals. We validate the effectiveness of the approach through a series of simulations."}

It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \\emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $Θ(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations. Extensive experiments show that, for $k$ up to half the grid width, the proposed storage-retrieval framework essentially eliminates relocations. For $k$ values up to the full grid width, relocations are reduced by $50\\%+$."}

In particular, the characterization of healthy and pathological tissues can provide vital information for diagnosis. In this paper, preliminary results from a small-scale measurement campaign conducted in 0.5-26.5GHz during real surgeries on healthy and malignant human colon tissues are presented. Those measurements were carried out externally to the colon, without direct contact to the tumor growing inside the colon. Furthermore, different tumor stages are taken into account. Initial findings reveal that advanced tumor stages are related with increased higher values of dielectric properties in malignant tumor tissues compared to the healthy ones."}

The soft wrist allows safe contact exploration during data collection, while tactile memory reuses past demonstrations via retrieval for flexible adaptation to unseen scenarios. The core of this system is the Masked Tactile Trajectory Transformer (MAT$^\\text{3}$), which jointly models spatiotemporal interactions between robot actions, distributed tactile feedback, force-torque measurements, and proprioceptive signals. Through masked-token prediction, MAT$^\\text{3}$ learns rich spatiotemporal representations by inferring missing sensory information from context, autonomously extracting task-relevant features without explicit subtask segmentation.

Evaluated on the Anti-UAV-RGBT dataset with 226 real drone sequences, P2P achieves 28.12 pixel average displacement error and 0.597 ISR, representing a 77% improvement in trajectory prediction and 597x improvement in pursuit feasibility over tracking-only baselines, while maintaining perfect drone classification accuracy (100%).

To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold.

However, a complete transition to DDMC-based waveforms is not yet practically feasible. This is because 5G NR based waveforms, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), remain as the modulation schemes for the sixth-generation radio (6GR). Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate how we can still benefit from DD-domain processing in high-mobility scenarios using 5G NR sounding reference signals (SRSs). By considering a DFT-s-OFDM receiver, we transform each received OFDM symbol into the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the channel is then estimated. With this approach, we estimate the DD channel parameters, allowing us to predict the aged channel over OFDM symbols without pilots. To improve channel prediction, we propose a linear joint channel estimation and equalization technique, where we use the detected data in each OFDM symbol to sequentially update our channel estimates. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the conventional frequency-domain estimation technique in terms of bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). Furthermore, we show that using only two slots with SRS for initial channel estimation, our method supports pilot-free detection for more than 25 subsequent OFDM symbols."}

The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to \"empty room\" and \"person present\", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the \"person present\" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas \"empty room\" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting."}

A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification", "categories": ["cs.LG", "eess.SP"], "comment": "17 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment."}

Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions. This exposes a fundamental limitation of linear reward mixing in adversarial imitation learning. We propose \\emph{Task-Centric Motion Priors} (TCMP), a task-priority adversarial imitation framework that treats imitation as a conditional regularizer rather than a co-equal objective. TCMP maximizes task improvement while incorporating imitation signals only when they are compatible with task progress, yielding an adaptive, geometry-aware update that preserves task-feasible descent and suppresses harmful imitation under misalignment. We provide theoretical analysis of gradient conflict and task-priority stationary points, and validate our claims through humanoid control experiments demonstrating robust task performance with consistent motion style under noisy demonstrations."}

A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency."}

Observing 3D live cells requires scanning through the cell volume while minimizing lethal phototoxicity. That limits acquisition time and results in sparsely sampled volumes with anisotropic resolution and high noise. Existing image restoration methods, primarily based on inverse problem modeling, assume known and stable degradation processes and struggle under such conditions, especially in the absence of high-quality reference volumes. In this paper, from a new perspective, we propose a novel tensor completion framework tailored to the nature of FM imaging, which inherently involves nonlinear signal degradation and incomplete observations. Specifically, FM imaging with equidistant Z-axis sampling is essentially a tensor completion task under a uniformly random sampling condition. On one hand, we derive the theoretical lower bound for exact cell tensor completion, validating the feasibility of accurately recovering 3D cell tensor. On the other hand, we reformulate the tensor completion problem as a mathematically equivalent score-based generative model. By incorporating structural consistency priors, the generative trajectory is effectively guided toward denoised and geometrically coherent reconstructions.

Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance."}

In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution.

This enables a continuous and stable reconfiguration process that is independent of the surrounding medium, allowing the system to reliably form various configurations in diverse environments. To leverage the unique kinematics of Rhombot, we introduce morphpivoting, a novel motion primitive for reconfiguration that differs from advanced MSRR systems, and propose a strategy for its continuous execution. Finally, a series of physical experiments validate the module's stable reconfiguration ability, as well as its positional and docking accuracy."}

In this framework, Catmull-Rom splines are utilized to characterize lane lines, and all the other ground markings are depicted using polygons uniformly. The results from instance segmentation serve as references to refine the three-dimensional position of spline control points and polygon corner points. In conjunction with this process, the homography matrix of IPM and vehicle poses are optimized simultaneously. Our proposed framework significantly reduces the mapping errors associated with IPM. It also improves the accuracy of the initial IPM homography matrix and the predicted vehicle poses. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations imposed by the coplanarity assumption in IPM. These enhancements enable IPM to be effectively applied to vectorized road mapping, which serves a cost-effective solution with enhanced accuracy. In addition, our framework generalizes road map elements to include all common ground markings and lane lines. The proposed framework is evaluated in two different practical scenarios, and the test results show that our method can automatically generate high-precision maps with near-centimeter-level accuracy. Importantly, the optimized IPM matrix achieves an accuracy comparable to that of manual calibration, while the accuracy of vehicle poses is also significantly improved."}

We observe that VLA inference exhibits structured redundancies across temporal, spatial, and depth dimensions, and that most existing efficiency methods ignore action context, despite its central role in embodied tasks. To address this gap, we propose Action-Context-aware Adaptive Computation for VLA models (AC^2-VLA), a unified framework that conditions computation on current visual observations, language instructions, and previous action states. Based on this action-centric context, AC^2-VLA adaptively performs cognition reuse across timesteps, token pruning, and selective execution of model components within a unified mechanism. To train the adaptive policy, we introduce an action-guided self-distillation scheme that preserves the behavior of the dense VLA policy while enabling structured sparsification that transfers across tasks and settings. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that AC^2-VLA achieves up to a 1.79\\times speedup while reducing FLOPs to 29.4% of the dense baseline, with comparable task success."}

Existing approaches typically rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware responses based on user metadata and historical interactions or on adaptive methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) to learn from users' immediate reactions in real time. However, these approaches fall short of comprehensively capturing user preferences-including long-term, short-term, and fine-grained aspects-, and of using them to rank and select actions, proactively personalize interactions, and ensure ethically responsible adaptations. To address the limitations, we propose drawing on recommender systems (RSs), which specialize in modeling user preferences and providing personalized recommendations. To ensure the integration of RS techniques is well-grounded and seamless throughout the social robot pipeline, we (i) align the paradigms underlying social robots and RSs, (ii) identify key techniques that can enhance personalization in social robots, and (iii) design them as modular, plug-and-play components. This work not only establishes a framework for integrating RS techniques into social robots but also opens a pathway for deep collaboration between the RS and HRI communities, accelerating innovation in both fields."}

Results revealed that anthropomorphism determines whether people extend moral consideration to robots, while moral foundations shape how they reason about such consideration. Qualitative analysis revealed distinct reasoning patterns: low-progressivism individuals employed character-based judgments, while high-progressivism individuals engaged in future-oriented moral deliberation.

To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination. We validated the effectiveness of this framework through multiple subject video demonstrations, which we collected and made open-source, and exploiting data from an external, publicly available dataset. Comparisons with existing methods revealed significant improvements in generating a centralized execution plan for coordinating two-arm systems."}

We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned."}

To illustrate this approach, we implemented HumanoidTurk, taking a first step toward a humanoid-based haptic system that translates in-game g-force signals into synchronized motion feedback in VR driving. A pilot study involving six participants compared two synthesis methods, leading us to adopt a filter-based approach for smoother and more realistic feedback. A subsequent study with sixteen participants evaluated four conditions: no-feedback, controller, humanoid+controller, and human+controller. Results showed that humanoid feedback enhanced immersion, realism, and enjoyment, while introducing moderate costs in terms of comfort and simulation sickness. Interviews further highlighted the robot's consistency and predictability in contrast to the adaptability of human feedback. From these findings, we identify fidelity, adaptability, and versatility as emerging themes, positioning humanoids as a distinct haptic modality for immersive VR."}

We introduce Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex), a scalable reinforcement learning method that conducts exploration directly in the native high-dimensional action space. During training, Qflex traverses actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients rather than isotropic noise. Our proposed method substantially outperforms representative online reinforcement learning baselines across diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks. Qflex also successfully controls a full-body human musculoskeletal model to perform agile, complex movements, demonstrating superior scalability and sample efficiency in very high-dimensional settings.

Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities.
