Due to practical\nconstraints, privacy concerns, or malfunctions, we often observe only a\nfraction of the topological evolution and associated signal, which not only\nhinders downstream tasks but also restricts our analysis of network evolution.\nSuch aspects could be mitigated by moving our attention at the underlying\nlatent driving factors of the network evolution, which can be naturally\nuncovered via low-rank tensor decomposition. Tensor-based methods provide a\npowerful means of uncovering the underlying factors of network evolution\nthrough low-rank decompositions. However, the extracted embeddings typically\nlack a relational structure and are obtained independently from the node\nsignals. This disconnect reduces the interpretability of the embeddings and\noverlooks the coupling between topology and signals. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel two-way decomposition to represent a dynamic\ngraph topology, where the structural evolution is captured by a linear\ncombination of latent graph adjacency matrices reflecting the overall joint\nevolution of both the topology and the signal. Using spatio-temporal data, we\nestimate the latent adjacency matrices and their temporal scaling signatures\nvia alternating minimization, and prove that our approach converges to a\nstationary point. Numerical results show that the proposed method recovers\nindividually and collectively expressive latent graphs, outperforming both\nstandard tensor-based decompositions and signal-based topology identification\nmethods in reconstructing the missing network especially when observations are\nlimited."}
