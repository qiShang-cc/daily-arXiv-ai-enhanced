To\nfill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into\naccount the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact\nof adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average\npower consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly\noptimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit\nbeamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to\nconsider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional\ndegree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and\ndiscrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the\nfact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the\nchannel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To\ntackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for\ncontinuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a\nmixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) method.

In this paper, we strive to answer this\nquestion by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical\nalgorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are\ninduced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the\npermutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed\nby two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not.

Although the viability of the LLM optimizer (LLMO) framework has\nbeen studied in various black-box scenarios, it has so far been limited to\nnumerical simulations. For the first time, this paper establishes a theoretical\nfoundation for the LLMO framework. With careful investigations of LLM inference\nsteps, we can interpret the LLMO procedure as a finite-state Markov chain, and\nprove the convergence of the framework. Our results are extended to a more\nadvanced multiple LLM architecture, where the impact of multiple LLMs is\nrigorously verified in terms of the convergence rate. Comprehensive numerical\nsimulations validate our theoretical results and provide a deeper understanding\nof the underlying mechanisms of the LLMO framework."}

However, its potential for\nstructural health monitoring (SHM), which requires the detection of slow and\nsubtle structural changes, remains largely unexplored due to challenges such as\nmultipath interference and the need for ultra-high sensing precision. This\nstudy introduces a novel theoretical framework for SHM via ISAC by leveraging\nreconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as reference points in collaboration\nwith base stations and users. By dynamically adjusting RIS phases to generate\ndistinct radio signals that suppress background multipath interference,\nmeasurement accuracy at these reference points is enhanced. We theoretically\nanalyze RIS-aided collaborative sensing in three-dimensional cellular networks\nusing Fisher information theory, demonstrating how increasing observation time,\nincorporating additional receivers (even with self-positioning errors),\noptimizing RIS phases, and refining collaborative node selection can reduce the\nposition error bound to meet SHM's stringent accuracy requirements.\nFurthermore, we develop a Bayesian inference model to identify structural\nstates and validate damage detection probabilities. Both theoretical and\nnumerical analyses confirm ISAC's capability for millimeter-level deformation\ndetection, highlighting its potential for high-precision SHM applications."}

Traditional wired links face high resistivity and latency, while\nmillimeter-wave wireless solutions suffer from bandwidth congestion and\ninterference. Terahertz (THz) plasmonic communication, based on surface plasmon\npolaritons (SPPs), offers high data rates and broad bandwidth, and is\ncompatible with nanophotonic platforms. This work introduces a Binary\nField-Driven Meta-Routing Method supported by a semi-analytical framework that\nmodels the tunable interaction between THz plasmonic phenomena and graphene's\nelectromagnetic properties. By modulating graphene's impedance, the method\nenables dynamic coupling and routing of localized surface plasmon resonances\n(LSPRs) across a meta-network, facilitating real-time beam steering in\nchip-scale systems. Combining analytical conductivity models, coupled-mode\ntheory, and algorithmic control, the approach enables predictive configuration\nof LSPR-based steering in reconfigurable graphene metasurfaces. Four meta-pixel\nantenna configurations Y-MetaRouter, MetaSwitcher, Penta-MetaEmitter, and\nCP-MetaCore are designed to support unidirectional radiation, bi-directional\nsteering, frequency-driven transitions, and circular polarization,\nrespectively. Chemical potential modulation creates reconfigurable LSPR\npathways and virtual SPP channels. A Coupled-Mode Theory for Field-Driven LSPR\nMeta-Networks is proposed to model current distributions and predict far-field\ncharacteristics. Results show strong agreement between theory and full-wave\nsimulations. A point-to-point meta-wireless link is analyzed, demonstrating\nscalability for low-latency, high-performance THz communication in WiNoC and\nchiplet applications. System-level metrics confirm feasibility for\nspace-constrained, high-speed interconnects."}
