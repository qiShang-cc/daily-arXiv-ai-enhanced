Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation enables simple\nand robust channel compensation under such conditions. However, fractional\ndelay and Doppler components introduce inter-path interference, degrading\nestimation accuracy. We propose a two-stage estimation method based on Prony's\ntechnique using OTFS pilot signals with M subchannels and N pilot repetitions.\nIn the first stage, Doppler frequencies are estimated by jointly solving M\ncoupled Prony equations, exploiting the periodicity of the pilot signal. In the\nsecond stage, delays are estimated by applying the discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT) and Prony's method to each Doppler component obtained in the first stage.\nThe proposed method can accurately estimate up to N-1 delay-Doppler parameters\nunder noiseless conditions. In noisy environments, conventional information\ncriteria such as AIC and BIC yield suboptimal performance; thus, a heuristic\nmodel order selection is adopted. Numerical simulations confirm that the\nproposed method achieves high estimation accuracy, highlighting its potential\nfor future ISAC frameworks."}

Among these methods, domain generalization\napproaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault\nfeatures. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific\nmulti-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect\nfault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial.

In this paper we refine a recent\nnonparametric, nonasymptotic method for constructing simultaneous confidence\nregions for band-limited functions from noisy input-output measurements, by\nworking in a Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Kernel norm bounds\nare tightened using a uniformly-randomized Hoeffding's inequality for small\nsamples and an empirical Bernstein bound for larger ones. We derive an\napproximate threshold, based on the sample size and how informative the inputs\nare, that governs which bound to deploy. Finally, we apply majority voting to\naggregate confidence sets from random subsamples, boosting both stability and\nregion size. We prove that even per-input aggregated intervals retain their\nsimultaneous coverage guarantee. These refinements are also validated through\nnumerical experiments."}

To develop a rigorous\nframework to guarantee privacy for the succinct histogram problem, local\ndifferential privacy (LDP) has been utilized and shown promising results. To\npreserve data utility under LDP, which essentially works by intentionally\nadding noise to data, error-correcting codes naturally emerge as a promising\ntool for reliable information collection. This work presents the first\npractical $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-LDP protocol for constructing succinct histograms\nusing error-correcting codes. To this end, polar codes and their\nsuccessive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithms are leveraged as the\nunderlying coding scheme. More specifically, our protocol introduces\nGaussian-based perturbations to enable efficient soft decoding. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods, particularly for items\nwith low true frequencies, while maintaining similar frequency estimation\naccuracy."}

Traditional MOT\nmethods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data\nassociation and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully\ndata-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer\ndistinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods\nare generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven\nMOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for\ntraining is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can\nintegrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that\nutilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model\nin Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so,\nthe performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved.\nTo ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid\nhigh-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to\nperform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines\nthe flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to\nlearn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving\ndataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance"}

The knowledge score is\ninterpretable and naturally bounded between 0 and 1.
