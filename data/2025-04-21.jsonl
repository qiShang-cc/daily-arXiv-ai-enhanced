This tells us whether the image shows a profile (vertical\nplane) view, a plan (horizontal plane) view or some view in between. If the\nprocessor can provide this information, then the ATR processor can try to match\nthe images with known vertical or horizontal features of ships and, in\nconjunction with estimated ship length, narrow the set of possible\nidentifications. This paper extends the work of Melendez and Bennett [M-B, Ref.\n1] by combining a focus algorithm with a method that models the angles of the\nship relative to the radar. In M-B the algorithm was limited to a single angle\nand the plane of rotation was not determined. This assumption may be fine for a\nshort time image where there is limited data available to determine the pose.\nHowever, the present paper models the ship rotation with two angles - aspect\nangle, representing rotation in the horizontal plane, and tilt angle,\nrepresenting variations in the effective grazing angle to the ship."}

Unlike conventional\nflexible-antenna systems, pinching antennas offer the advantage of creating\nline-of-sight links by enabling antennas to be activated on the waveguide at a\nlocation close to the user. This paper investigates a typical two-user\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink scenario, where multiple\npinching antennas are activated on a single dielectric waveguide to assist NOMA\ntransmission. We formulate the problem of maximizing the data rate of one user\nsubject to the quality-of-service requirement of the other user by jointly\noptimizing the antenna locations and power allocation coefficients. The\nformulated problem is nonconvex and difficult to solve due to the impact of\nantenna locations on large-scale path loss and two types of phase shifts,\nnamely in-waveguide phase shifts and free space propagation phase shifts. To\nthis end, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent\nand successive convex approximation techniques.
