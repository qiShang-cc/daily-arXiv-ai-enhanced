In\nthis work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We\nintroduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric\nquantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing\nmechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to\nimprove generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a\nnovel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen\nhairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral\n(MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair\nstyling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model\noutperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen\nhairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling\ntasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error\nand 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world\nexperiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving\nconsistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art\nsystem fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based\nrobot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible\nrobot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments.

Besides for\nunsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment\nas a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We\nshow that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient\ndownstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of\nempowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's\ncontrol over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging\nthis formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes\npolicies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a\nrobust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based\npre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its\npotential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing\npolicies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to\nimproved adaptability in downstream tasks.

The study employed a multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) agent as a classical baseline and a parameterized variational quantum\ncircuit (VQC) as a quantum counterpart, both trained on the CartPole-v1\nenvironment over 500 episodes. Empirical results demonstrated that the\nclassical MLP achieved near-optimal policy convergence with a mean return of\n498.7 +/- 3.2, maintaining stable equilibrium throughout training. In contrast,\nthe VQC exhibited limited learning capability, with an average return of 14.6\n+/- 4.8, primarily constrained by circuit depth and qubit connectivity. Noise\nrobustness analysis further revealed that the MLP policy deteriorated\ngracefully under Gaussian perturbations, while the VQC displayed higher\nsensitivity at equivalent noise levels. Despite the lower asymptotic\nperformance, the VQC exhibited significantly lower parameter count and\nmarginally increased training time, highlighting its potential scalability for\nlow-resource quantum processors.
