This decomposition enables a\nmore effective exploitation of the beam pattern's physical properties, which we\nrefer to as the Sensing-Guided Communication Dual-Function (SGCDF) beam pattern\ndesign. We further develop a low-complexity extension using the Riemannian\nManifold Optimization (RMO) and convex closed-set projection. Simulation\nresults confirm that the proposed method improves multi-target estimation\naccuracy, compared to traditional joint optimization strategies, by preserving\nthe beam pattern, while the low-complexity version offers an excellent\nperformance-complexity tradeoff, maintaining high accuracy with significantly\nreduced computational cost."}

Submitted to IEEE Conference", "summary": "Given that Visual SLAM relies on appearance cues for localization and scene\nunderstanding, texture-less or visually degraded environments (e.g., plain\nwalls or low lighting) lead to poor pose estimation and track loss. However,\nrobots are typically equipped with sensors that provide some form of dead\nreckoning odometry with reasonable short-time performance but unreliable\nlong-time performance. The Good Weights (GW) algorithm described here provides\na framework to adaptively integrate dead reckoning (DR) with passive visual\nSLAM for continuous and accurate frame-level pose estimation. Importantly, it\ndescribes how all modules in a comprehensive SLAM system must be modified to\nincorporate DR into its design. Adaptive weighting increases DR influence when\nvisual tracking is unreliable and reduces when visual feature information is\nstrong, maintaining pose track without overreliance on DR. Good Weights yields\na practical solution for mobile navigation that improves visual SLAM\nperformance and robustness.

However, in such devices, the battery and\nelectronics are wired and could introduce damage or implant malfunction. In\nthese cases, a Stentrode integrated with magnetoelectric (ME) antennas could be\nof great interest.

In\ncontrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB,\ndominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass\nsupervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling\nbehaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical\napplications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG\nanalysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and\npatient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being\norders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources\nhighlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models."}

The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically\ndepends on achieving rank-1 matrices, a condition that typically requires\nadditional tightening. In this work, we focus on trace-constrained SDPs, where\nthe decision variables are positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices with fixed\ntrace values. These additional constraints not only capture important\nstructural properties but also facilitate first-order methods for recovering\nrank-1 solutions. We introduce customized fixed-trace variables and constraints\nto represent common robotic quantities such as rotations and translations,\nwhich can be exactly recovered when the corresponding variables are rank-1. To\nfurther improve practical performance, we develop a gradient-based refinement\nprocedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost\ncandidates, which can then be certified for global optimality via the dual\nproblem. We demonstrate that many robotics tasks can be expressed within this\ntrace-constrained SDP framework, and showcase its effectiveness through\nsimulations in perspective-n-point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and\ndual-robot system calibration.

Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning\nsignal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of\ninformation fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on\nprincipled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information\nFidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an\noptimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity\nbased on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the\nidentification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where\ntraining stability degrades.

The environment contains multiple unknown semantically\nlabeled regions or objects, and the robot must reach desired locations while\nmaintaining class-dependent distances from them. We aim to compute robot paths\nthat complete such semantic reach-avoid tasks with user-defined probability\ndespite uncertain perception. Existing planning algorithms either ignore\nperceptual uncertainty - thus lacking correctness guarantees - or assume known\nsensor models and noise characteristics. In contrast, we present the first\nplanner for semantic reach-avoid tasks that achieves user-specified mission\ncompletion rates without requiring any knowledge of sensor models or noise.\nThis is enabled by quantifying uncertainty in semantic maps - constructed\non-the-fly from perceptual measurements - using conformal prediction in a\nmodel- and distribution-free manner. We validate our approach and the\ntheoretical mission completion rates through extensive experiments, showing\nthat it consistently outperforms baselines in mission success rates."}

Contrary to prior approaches that rely on explicit\nknowledge of defender strategies or utilize conservative safety conditions\nbased on a defender's range, our work characterizes defender threats\ngeometrically through engagement zones that delineate inevitable interception\nregions. Outside these engagement zones, the interceptor remains invulnerable.\nThe proposed guidance law switches between a repulsive safety maneuver near\nthese zones and a pursuit maneuver outside their influence. To deal with\nmultiple engagement zones, we employ a smooth minimum function\n(log-sum-exponent approximation) that aggregates threats from all the zones\nwhile prioritizing the most critical threats. Input saturation is modeled and\nembedded in the non-holonomic vehicle dynamics so the controller respects\nactuator limits while maintaining stability. Numerical simulations with several\ndefenders demonstrate the proposed method's ability to avoid engagement zones\nand achieve interception across diverse initial conditions."}

We learn this representation by predicting future events\nfrom past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion\ninformation. $\\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to\nnoise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas\nfrom multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and\n440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous\nspatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream\ntasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,\nsemantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from\nthree robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),\nacross different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments\n(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors\n(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at\n25-75 Hz at HD resolution."}
