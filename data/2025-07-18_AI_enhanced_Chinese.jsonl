The channel when viewed in the DD domain is\npredictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically,\nalbeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication\nscheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot\ntransmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be\nused as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data\ncan enable further detection enabling the \"differential\" aspect of the\ncommunication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD\nchannel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data\nsymbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next\ninstant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it\nallows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would\notherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols.\nSecond, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded\npilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot\nscheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower\ncomplexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5dee\u5206\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\u7528\u4e8eZak-OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5bfc\u9891\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u9891\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684Zak-OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u9700\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5bfc\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5360\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5bfc\u9891\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5dee\u5206\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7DD\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u8fde\u7eed\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5dee\u5206\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\u4e3aZak-OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bfc\u9891\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be\ntime-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited\ncomputing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing\nresources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters.

In this paper, we propose design criteria to\ngenerate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that\nafter training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error\n(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels.

To robustly estimate head pose,\nwe propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,\nincluding joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss\nfunction design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA\npose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex\nerror of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out\ncross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free\nbio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA\nvision-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeckSense\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u5934\u90e8\u59ff\u52bf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u901a\u9053\u751f\u7269\u963b\u6297\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u89c6\u7ebf\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u4fbf\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u7ebf\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u7ebf\u53d7\u963b\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u8212\u9002\u7684\u5934\u90e8\u59ff\u52bf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u901a\u9053\u751f\u7269\u963b\u6297\u4f20\u611f\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f18\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9876\u70b9\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a25.9\u6beb\u7c73\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "NeckSense\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u963b\u6297\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u5934\u90e8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A set of \"not-directly-accessible\" (NDA)\nantennas can be switched between being terminated by the DUT or by a specific,\nknown, tunable load network. Waves can be radiated and captured via a distinct\nset of \"accessible\" antennas that couple OTA to the NDA antennas. First, we\ncharacterize the OTA fixture between the accessible antennas' ports and the\nDUT's ports. We achieve this based on our recently introduced \"Virtual VNA\"\ntechnique; specifically, we connect the NDA antennas to the tunable load\nnetwork and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas' ports for\nvarious configurations of the tunable load network. Second, we connect the NDA\nantennas to the DUT and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas'\nports. Third, we de-embed the OTA fixture to retrieve the DUT's scattering\nparameters. We experimentally validate our technique at 2.45 GHz for 1-port\nDUTs and 5-port DUTs, considering a rich-scattering OTA fixture inside a\nreverberation chamber.
