Abstract: General requirements for radar digital signal processing are ionospheric
distortion and Doppler dispersion correction, which has historically required
radar-specific hardware to implement in real time. Although analog solutions
are computationally efficient, they often come with system design drawbacks
which limit waveform flexibility and can result in an overall increase of
system complexity. With improvements in modern general compute systems,
real-time digital signal processing is becoming more realizable using
non-radar-specific high-performance compute. In this paper, we present an
analysis of general Doppler and ionospheric correction algorithms for arbitrary
waveforms for radar digital signal processing. We also include considerations
for efficient implementation of these algorithms in software, specifically
using GPU hardware. This analysis includes metrics of performance such as
execution time and error correction accuracy. We also provide recommendations
for application in radar signal processing. We identify two algorithms for
dispersion correction: an FFT-based method for ionospheric dispersion and a
numerical interpolation method via sinc interpolation for Doppler dispersion.
Both of these algorithms are able to compensate for dispersion equivalent in
accuracy to waveform-specific analytical methods and were able to be performed
in real-time on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. These methods are waveform agnostic
and applied directly to the samples, improving system flexibility and making
them easy to incorporate into existing software-defined radio systems.

### [2] [Anti-Jamming Sensing with Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04964)
*Zhaowei Wang,Yunsong Huang,Weicheng Liu,Hui-Ming Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用分布式可重构智能超表面天线（RIMSA）和深度学习算法来提高无线传感精度的方法，即使在高干扰环境下也能保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的无线传感方法在复杂多变的无线环境中（如衰落和噪声）性能受限，因此需要一种能够在恶劣信道条件下提高传感精度的方法。

Method: 通过部署多个RIMSA接收器，并利用深度强化学习（DRL）优化波束成形模式，同时设计神经网络将接收信号转换为传感结果。此外，还设计了考虑信干噪比（SINR）的损失函数以应对干扰。

Result: 仿真结果表明，分布式RIMSA系统比集中式实现具有更高的传感效率和更强的环境适应能力，即使在干扰攻击下也能保持高精度。

Conclusion: 分布式RIMSA结合DRL和神经网络的方案能有效提升无线传感的鲁棒性和精度，适用于复杂无线环境。

Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has
garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable
and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods
is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the
receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing
distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect
the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)
are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,
RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem
is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping
of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we
introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating
the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting
received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may
potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable
effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss
function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed
distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and
better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation.
Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance
even under jamming attack.

### [3] [Localized Kernel Methods for Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04978)
*Sippanon Kitimoon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于局部核的信号处理方法，分别在多维指数模型参数恢复和线性啁啾信号分离中表现出色。方法无需子空间分解或稀疏正则化，且在低信噪比下优于经典算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决噪声环境下参数恢复和信号分离的挑战，特别是在低信噪比和复杂信号条件下。

Method: 第一种方法使用局部三角多项式核检测多变量频率；第二种方法通过局部核构造SSO变体，结合FFT滤波和线性回归分离啁啾信号。

Result: 在单变量情况下，方法在低信噪比下优于MUSIC和ESPRIT；多变量情况下样本需求更低。啁啾信号分离方法可在-30dB SNR下恢复交叉和间断信号。

Conclusion: 基于局部核的方法具有鲁棒性和高效性，未来可扩展至非线性啁啾、自适应核设计和信号分类。

Abstract: This dissertation presents two signal processing methods using specially
designed localized kernels for parameter recovery under noisy condition. The
first method addresses the estimation of frequencies and amplitudes in
multidimensional exponential models. It utilizes localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels to detect the multivariate frequencies, followed by a more
detailed parameter estimation. We compare our method with MUSIC and ESPRIT,
which are classical subspace-based algorithms widely used for estimating the
parameters of exponential signals. In the univariate case, the method
outperforms MUSIC and ESPRIT under low signal-to-noise ratios. For the
multivariate case, we develop a coordinate-wise projection and registration
approach that achieves high recovery accuracy using significantly fewer samples
than other methods.
  The second method focuses on separating linear chirp components from
time-localized signal segments. A variant of the Signal Separation Operator
(SSO) is constructed using a localized kernel. Instantaneous frequency
estimates are obtained via FFT-based filtering, then clustered and fitted with
piecewise linear regression. The method operates without prior knowledge of the
number of components and is shown to recover intersecting and discontinuous
chirps at SNR levels as low as -30 dB.
  Both methods share an idea based on localized kernels and efficient FFT-based
implementation, and neither requires subspace decomposition or sparsity
regularization. Experimental results confirm the robustness and tractability of
the proposed approaches across a range of simulated data conditions. Potential
extensions include application to nonlinear chirps, adaptive kernel design, and
signal classification using extracted features.

### [4] [Power-Constrained and Quantized MIMO-RSMA Systems with Imperfect CSIT: Joint Precoding, Antenna Selection, and Power Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05080)
*Jiwon Sung,Seokjun Park,Jinseok Choi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合预编码、天线选择和发射功率控制算法，以最大化基站总功率预算下的频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 充分利用基站的可用功率潜力，解决多用户MIMO系统中频谱效率最大化的问题。

Method: 通过条件平均速率方法处理不完善的CSIT，并分解问题为预编码方向和功率控制子问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，在使用基站全部功率预算时，8-11位的中分辨率DAC可能比低分辨率DAC更高效。

Conclusion: 所提算法在处理大规模MIMO系统时更高效，中分辨率DAC在功率效率上表现优越。

Abstract: To utilize the full potential of the available power at a base station (BS),
we propose a joint precoding, antenna selection, and transmit power control
algorithm for a total power budget at the BS. We formulate a sum spectral
efficiency (SE) maximization problem for downlink multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems with
arbitrary-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs). We reformulate the
problem by defining the ergodic sum SE using the conditional average rate
approach to handle imperfect channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT), and by using approximation techniques to make the problem more
tractable. Then, we decompose the problem into precoding direction and power
control subproblems. We solve the precoding direction subproblem by identifying
a superior Lagrangian stationary point, and the power control subproblem using
gradient descent. We also propose a complexity-reduction approach that is more
suitable for massive MIMO systems. Simulation results not only validate the
proposed algorithm but also reveal that when utilizing the full potential of
the power budget at the BS, medium-resolution DACs with 8-11 bits may actually
be more power-efficient than low-resolution DACs.

### [5] [Digital Twin Channel-Aided CSI Prediction: A Environment-based Subspace Extraction Approach for Achieving Low Overhead and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05142)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于环境特定通道子空间基（EB）的部分到完整通道状态信息预测方法（EB-P2WCP），用于实现数字孪生通道（DTC）的低开销通道预测。EB-P2WNet网络融合EB与实时局部CSI，显著降低了开销并保持了高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为满足6G移动通信系统在复杂场景中对鲁棒高速通信的需求，利用传感与AI的数字孪生通道技术降低系统开销。

Method: 提取数字孪生地图中的EB作为环境先验信息，设计EB-P2WNet网络融合EB与实时CSI预测全时空通道。

Result: 在低信噪比和低导频比例条件下显著降低50%开销，抗多用户干扰且容忍定位误差，预测速度达1.3毫秒。

Conclusion: EB-P2WCP方法高效且鲁棒，适合复杂通信场景的快速通道预测。

Abstract: To meet the robust and high-speed communication requirements of the
sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system in complex scenarios,
sensing- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twin channel (DTC)
techniques become a promising approach to reduce system overhead. In this
paper, we propose an environment-specific channel subspace basis (EB)-aided
partial-to-whole channel state information (CSI) prediction method (EB-P2WCP)
for realizing DTC-enabled low-overhead channel prediction. Specifically, EB is
utilized to characterize the static properties of the electromagnetic
environment, which is extracted from the digital twin map, serving as
environmental information prior to the prediction task. Then, we fuse EB with
real-time estimated local CSI to predict the entire spatial-frequency domain
channel for both the present and future time instances. Hence, an EB-based
partial-to-whole CSI prediction network (EB-P2WNet) is designed to achieve a
robust channel prediction scheme in various complex scenarios. Simulation
results indicate that incorporating EB provides significant benefits under low
signal-to-noise ratio and pilot ratio conditions, achieving a reduction of up
to 50% in pilot overhead. Additionally, the proposed method maintains
robustness against multi-user interference, tolerating 3-meter localization
errors with only a 0.5 dB NMSE increase, and predicts CSI for the next channel
coherent time within 1.3 milliseconds.

### [6] [Optimization of Liquid Lens-based Imaging Receiver for MIMO VLC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05204)
*Kapila W. S. Palitharathna,Christodoulos Skouroumounis,Ioannis Krikidis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于液体透镜的成像接收器，用于MIMO可见光通信系统，通过动态调整焦距和角度降低信道增益的空间相关性，显著提升了误码率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态透镜在动态条件下（如用户移动或接收器随机取向）适应性不足，限制了MIMO系统的性能，液体透镜提供动态调整能力以优化信道。

Method: 开发了数学模型描述信道增益，并提出了两种透镜调整方案（CLS和VULO），通过优化问题最小化误码率。

Result: 在随机取向方差为10°时，误码率从4×10-2显著降至5×10-4，优于传统静态透镜系统。

Conclusion: 液体透镜的动态适应性显著提升了MIMO VLC系统在动态环境中的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a liquid lens-based imaging receiver is proposed for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC)
systems. By dynamically adjusting the focal length and orientation angles of
the liquid lens, the spatial correlation between MIMO channel gains is reduced,
leading to enhanced bit-error rate (BER) performance. Unlike static lenses,
liquid lenses offer adaptability in dynamic conditions, including user mobility
and random receiver orientation. An accurate mathematical framework is
developed to model the channel gains of the proposed system, and an
optimization problem is formulated to minimize its BER. Due to the complexity
of the resulting channel model, two lens adjustment schemes, namely, ($i$) the
CLS scheme, and ($ii$) the VULO scheme are introduced. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed liquid lens-based system offers substantial BER
improvements over conventional static lens-based receivers across a wide range
of random receiver orientation conditions. Specifically, at a random receiver
orientation variance of $10^{\circ}$, the BER is improved from $4\times
10^{-2}$ to $5\times 10^{-4}$ by employing the proposed liquid lens.

### [7] [Deep Learning Based Dynamic Environment Reconstruction for Vehicular ISAC Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05226)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的ISAC框架，用于车辆环境重建，解决了现有方法在动态场景跟踪和时态一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过无线信号复用减少对额外传感器的依赖，提升智能交通系统中车辆对环境的感知能力。

Method: 基于多模态测量数据建立联合数据集，开发多阶段深度学习网络（场景解码器、聚类中心解码器和点云解码器）重建环境。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在Chamfer Distance和F Score@1%上表现优异，复杂度分析证明其适用于实时场景。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本环境重建提供了新途径，适用于未来智能交通系统。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology plays a critical role
in future intelligent transportation systems, by enabling vehicles to perceive
and reconstruct the surrounding environment through reuse of wireless signals,
thereby reducing or even eliminating the need for additional sensors such as
LiDAR or radar. However, existing ISAC based reconstruction methods often lack
the ability to track dynamic scenes with sufficient accuracy and temporal
consistency, limiting the real world applicability. To address this limitation,
we propose a deep learning based framework for vehicular environment
reconstruction by using ISAC channels. We first establish a joint channel
environment dataset based on multi modal measurements from real world urban
street scenarios. Then, a multistage deep learning network is developed to
reconstruct the environment. Specifically, a scene decoder identifies the
environmental context such as buildings, trees and so on; a cluster center
decoder predicts coarse spatial layouts by localizing dominant scattering
centers; a point cloud decoder recovers fine grained geometry and structure of
surrounding environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves high-quality dynamic environment reconstruction with a Chamfer
Distance of 0.29 and F Score@1% of 0.87. In addition, complexity analysis
demonstrates the efficiency and practical applicability of the method in real
time scenarios. This work provides a pathway toward low cost environment
reconstruction based on ISAC for future intelligent transportation.

### [8] [Unifying Common Signal Analyses with Instantaneous Time-Frequency Atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05380)
*Steven Sandoval,Phillip L. De Leon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于瞬时时间-频率原子的方法，用于统一多种信号分析（如时域、频域、分数阶傅里叶变换等），并通过二次线性调频小波生成对应的瞬时频谱（IS）的闭式解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在前人工作的基础上，本文旨在通过瞬时时间-频率原子将多种信号分析方法统一到一个框架中，并给出其对应的瞬时频谱的闭式解。

Method: 使用二次线性调频小波作为模板，将多种信号分析方法（如时域分析、频域分析等）视为对AM-FM成分的分解，并生成对应的IS闭式解。

Result: 通过一个双参数的二次线性调频小波，将这些IS组织成一个2D连续体，展示了不同信号分析方法之间的关联性。

Conclusion: 本文通过统一框架和闭式解的实现，为多种信号分析方法提供了更灵活的理论基础。

Abstract: In previous work, we presented a general framework for instantaneous
time-frequency analysis but did not provide any specific details of how to
compute a particular instantaneous spectrum (IS). In this work, we use
instantaneous time-frequency atoms to obtain an IS associated with common
signal analyses: time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, fractional
Fourier transform, synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, and
synchrosqueezed short-time fractional Fourier transform. By doing so, we
demonstrate how the general framework can be used to unify these analyses and
we develop closed-form expressions for the corresponding ISs. This is
accomplished by viewing these analyses as decompositions into AM--FM components
and recognizing that each uses a specialized (or limiting) form of a quadratic
chirplet as a template during analysis. With a two-parameter quadratic
chirplet, we can organize these ISs into a 2D continuum with points in the
plane corresponding to a decomposition related to one of the signal analyses.
Finally, using several example signals, we compute in closed-form the ISs for
the various analyses.

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统WiFi发射器功耗高、依赖电池和外部传感器的问题，提升设备的可持续性和普及性。

Method: 通过消除本地振荡器，利用双音入射波的二次互调提取频率，实现亚微瓦级功率通信和多功能集成。

Result: 首次突破WiFi发射器的微瓦级功耗限制，最低灵敏度达-19 dBm，并实现了位置和运动的无电池传感。

Conclusion: 该技术为物联网设备提供了无电池、低成本且高集成的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, a sub-uW power 802.11b backscattering transmitter is presented
to enable reuse of the same incident wave for three purposes: RF harvesting,
backscattering communications and position/motion sensing. The removal of the
battery and any off-chip motion sensor (e.g., MEMS) enables unprecedented level
of miniaturization and ubiquity, unrestricted device lifespan, low fabrication
and maintenance cost. The uW power wall for WiFi transmitters is broken for the
first time via local oscillator elimination, as achieved by extracting its
frequency through second-order intermodulation of a twotone incident wave. The
two-tone scheme also enables a cumulative harvesting/transmission/sensing
sensitivity down to Pmin -19 dBm. Position/motion sensing is enabled by using
the harvested voltage as a proxy for the Received Signal Strength (RSS),
allowing to sense the chip location with respect to the tone generator(s)
shared across tags in indoor neighborhoods.

Abstract: A four-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) for ultra-low-power
applications is introduced in this paper. The proposed circuit inclusive of
frequency compensation requires minimal transistor count and passives,
overcoming the traditionally difficult compensation of 4-stage OTAs and
bringing it back to the simplicity of 3-stage OTAs. At the same time, the
proposed circuit achieves high power efficiency, as evidenced by the >3.7X
(>11.3X) improvement in the large-signal (small-signal) power efficiency figure
of merit FOML (FOMS), compared to prior 4-stage OTAs (sub-1 V multi-stage
OTAs). Thanks to the lower sensitivity of the phase margin to the load
capacitance, the proposed OTA remains stable under a wide range of loads
(double-sided as in any 3-4-stage OTA), achieving a max/min ratio of the load
capacitance of >100X.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业机械维护需要及时干预以防止灾难性故障并优化运行效率，传统的异常检测方法缺乏具体的行动建议，因此需要一个更智能的解决方案。

Method: 开发了一个综合系统，将轴承振动频率数据（如BPFO、BPFI等）序列化为自然语言供LLM处理，结合多智能体技术分析维护手册和网络搜索信息，生成结构化维护建议。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

### [12] [Phase Noise Tolerance for Low-Pilot-Overhead OFDM Terahertz Links Beyond 64-QAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05026)
*Bowen Liu,Takasumi Tanabe*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 论文研究了太赫兹无线通信中高阶调制（如64-QAM以上）的性能限制，重点关注相位噪声对OFDM系统的影响，并提出了量化相位噪声容忍度的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于太赫频段的丰富未开发频谱，太赫无线通信能实现前所未有的数据速率。然而，相位误差限制了高阶调制的性能，尤其是OFDM系统的子载波正交性。

Method: 通过在2048子载波的64-QAM OFDM太赫兹传输系统中分析相位噪声影响，提出了3σ误差估计方法量化容忍度，并评估了不同振荡器的性能。

Result: 研究发现，相位噪声容忍度的EVM阈值约为5%，并揭示了相位噪声水平、SNR需求和导频开销之间的权衡。微环谐振器是实现低导频开销的关键组件。

Conclusion: 研究为设计支持高阶调制的太赫兹OFDM系统提供了实用指导，强调了微环谐振器在减少导频开销中的重要性。

Abstract: THz wireless communications have garnered significant attention due to their
unprecedented data rates enabled by the abundant untapped spectrum. However,
advanced modulation formats beyond 64-QAM remain largely unexplored, as phase
errors introduced during up/down-conversion severely limit system performance.
Particularly, OFDM transmission is highly susceptible to aggravated ICI induced
by phase noise, undermining the orthogonality of subcarriers. While PLLs and
pilot-assisted compensation can mitigate phase errors, excessive pilot overhead
compromises spectral efficiency and energy consumption, and white phase noise
remains unrecoverable. Therefore, quantifying phase noise tolerance is
essential for practical physical layer protocols. Here, we reveal the impact of
phase noise in a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM THz transmission system.
3{\sigma}-error estimation is proposed to quantify phase noise tolerance,
indicating an intuitive EVM threshold of approximately 5%. This threshold
further delineates the trade-offs among phase noise levels, SNR requirements,
and pilot overhead. Moreover, by benchmarking representative oscillators with
distinct phase noise spectra, microring resonators (MRRs) are identified as
indispensable enablers for low-pilot-overhead OFDM THz links operating beyond
64-QAM.

formulated to optimize the MA position, and an efficient algorithm based on
successive convex approximation is proposed to solve this non-convex
optimization problem. Simulation results show that, despite the overhead caused
by MA movement, the MA system can still improve the energy efficiency compared
to the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) system.

Abstract: This paper investigates an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled integrated
sensing, communication, and computation system, with a particular focus on
integrating movable antennas (MAs) into the system for enhancing overall system
performance. Specifically, multiple MA-enabled AVVs perform sensing tasks and
simultaneously transmit the generated computational tasks to the base station
for processing. To minimize the maximum latency under the sensing and resource
constraints, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly coordinates the
position of the MAs, the computation resource allocation, and the transmit
beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and strong
coupling among variables, we propose a two-layer iterative algorithm leveraging
particle swarm optimization and convex optimization to address it. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant
latency improvements compared to the baseline schemes.

Abstract: This paper presents a joint framework that integrates reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) with Terahertz (THz) communications and
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance smart industrial
communications. The proposed system leverages the advantages of RIS and THz
bands to improve spectral efficiency, coverage, and reliability key
requirements for industrial automation and real-time communications in future
6G networks and beyond. Within this framework, two power allocation strategies
are investigated: the first optimally distributes power between near and far
industrial nodes, and the second prioritizes network demands to enhance system
performance further. A performance evaluation is conducted to compare the sum
rate and outage probability against a fixed power allocation scheme. Our scheme
achieves up to a 23% sum rate gain over fixed PA at 30 dBm. Simulation results
validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness and
robustness of the RIS-assisted NOMA MIMO framework for THz enabled industrial
communications.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合量子与经典方法的Q-DPTS框架，用于时间序列预测，并在保证差分隐私的同时提升了模型性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融和能源系统等领域，时间序列预测对数据敏感性的要求很高。虽然差分隐私（DP）可以保护数据隐私，但传统方法（如DP-SGD）会因噪声注入导致性能下降。因此，作者希望探索量子计算在隐私保护预测中的潜力。

Method: 提出了Q-DPTS框架，结合了变分量子电路（VQC）、逐样本梯度裁剪和高斯噪声注入，确保严格的(ε, δ)-差分隐私。

Result: 在ETT数据集上，Q-DPTS相比经典和量子基线（如LSTM、QASA等），在相同隐私预算下实现了更低的预测误差。

Conclusion: Q-DPTS展示了量子计算在隐私保护时间序列预测中的优势，为隐私关键场景提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is
paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP)
provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its
integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to
injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical
framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS
combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping
and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables
improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We
evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a
standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is
compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA,
QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower
prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable
privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations
into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising
directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical
scenarios.

Motivation: 常规的最大似然估计器需要大量丢弃数据（或导频符号），导致符号效率显著下降。此外，估计和协调阶段的分离可能引入误差传播。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架下的期望最大化（EM）算法，在解码过程中同时估计未知参数，无需单独的ML估计。并引入了混合多维旋转方案，减少经典信道开销。

Result: 该方法首次统一了CV-QKD中的多维协调和信道参数估计，提供了高效率和最少导频的实用解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的方案显著提高了符号效率和减少了误差传播，为CV-QKD中的高效率和低开销提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Accurate quantum channel parameter estimation is essential for effective
information reconciliation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution
(CV-QKD). However, conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimators rely on a
large amount of discarded data (or pilot symbols), leading to a significant
loss in symbol efficiency. Moreover, the separation between the estimation and
reconciliation phases can introduce error propagation. In this paper, we
propose a novel joint message-passing scheme that unifies channel parameter
estimation and information reconciliation within a Bayesian framework. By
leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method
simultaneously estimates unknown parameters during decoding, eliminating the
need for separate ML estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid
multidimensional rotation scheme that removes the requirement for norm
feedback, significantly reducing classical channel overhead. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to unify multidimensional reconciliation and
channel parameter estimation in CV-QKD, providing a practical solution for
high-efficiency reconciliation with minimal pilots.
