### [1] [Multi-Sensor Fusion for Extended Object Tracking Exploiting Active and Passive Radio Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03686)
*Hong Zhu,Alexander Venus,Erik Leitinger,Klaus Witrisal*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种贝叶斯方法，结合主动和被动测量以提高设备定位精度，特别适用于LOS部分被遮挡的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由用户遮挡导致LOS链路部分阻塞的定位难题。

Method: 提出贝叶斯方法融合主动测量和被动雷达测量，开发了适用于人体的EO模型和简化实现。

Result: 在合成和实测数据上表现优于传统PDA方法。

Conclusion: 新方法在OLOS条件下显著提升了定位性能。

Abstract: Reliable and robust positioning of radio devices remains a challenging task
due to multipath propagation, hardware impairments, and interference from other
radio transmitters. A frequently overlooked but critical factor is the agent
itself, e.g., the user carrying the device, which potentially obstructs
line-of-sight (LOS) links to the base stations (anchors). This paper addresses
the problem of accurate positioning in scenarios where LOS links are partially
blocked by the agent. The agent is modeled as an extended object (EO) that
scatters, attenuates, and blocks radio signals. We propose a Bayesian method
that fuses ``active'' measurements (between device and anchors) with
``passive'' multistatic radar-type measurements (between anchors, reflected by
the EO). To handle measurement origin uncertainty, we introduce an multi-sensor
and multiple-measurement probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm that
jointly fuses all EO-related measurements. Furthermore, we develop an EO model
tailored to agents such as human users, accounting for multiple reflections
scattered off the body surface, and propose a simplified variant for
low-complexity implementation. Evaluation on both synthetic and real radio
measurements demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional
PDA methods based on point target assumptions, particularly during and after
obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) conditions.

### [2] [Sensor placement for sparse force reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03825)
*Jeunghoon Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Gram矩阵的传感器布局策略，通过在模态分解中选择低空间相关的区域放置传感器，以提升力重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏力重建在频域中的准确性受传感器布局影响，需一种科学方法优化布局以减少频率响应矩阵的相干性。

Method: 分析Gram矩阵的模态分解，提出贪婪算法选择传感器位置以最小化Gram矩阵的非对角能量。

Result: 数值模拟和实验验证表明，该方法优于启发式布局，能提供更鲁棒和准确的力估计。

Conclusion: 该策略为稀疏力重建提供了一种有效的传感器布局框架，显著提升了重建精度。

Abstract: The present study proposes a Gram-matrix-based sensor placement strategy for
sparse force reconstruction in the frequency domain. A modal decomposition of
the Gram matrix reveals that its structure is dominated by a few modes near the
target frequency, and that each modal contribution reflects the spatial
correlation of the corresponding mode shape. This suggests that placing sensors
near nodal regions where spatial correlation is low can reduce coherence in the
frequency response function (FRF) matrix and improve force reconstruction
accuracy. To translate the physical insight into a practical design framework,
a greedy algorithm is proposed to select sensor locations that minimize the
off-diagonal energy of the Gram matrix. Numerical simulations and experimental
validations demonstrate that the proposed method yields robust and accurate
force estimation, outperforming heuristic sensor layouts.

### [3] [A Low-Cost Open-Source BLE-Based Asian Hornet Tracking System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03979)
*Gilles Callebaut,Jan Van Moer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于蓝牙低功耗（BLE）的低成本、开源跟踪系统，用于定位亚洲大黄蜂巢穴，以保护生态环境和养蜂业。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚洲大黄蜂对生态系统和养蜂业构成严重威胁，传统的人工三角测量耗时且效率低，需要一种更高效的跟踪系统。

Method: 系统包括轻量级BLE标签和使用GNU Radio实现的软件定义无线电（SDR）接收器。通过绕过BLE协议栈，嵌入自定义伪噪声（PN）序列进行相关检测。使用Yagi天线和PlutoSDR进行数字波束扫描以确定标签方向。

Result: 现场测试显示，系统在50米距离内具有可靠的角分辨率，通信范围可达360米。

Conclusion: 该系统为黄蜂跟踪和环境监测提供了一种可扩展的开源框架，未来可通过多通道扩展和标签识别进一步改进。

Abstract: The Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) poses a serious threat to ecosystems and
beekeeping. Locating nests is essential, but usually involves time-consuming
manual triangulation. We present a low-cost, open-source tracking system based
on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The system consists of a lightweight BLE tag and
a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented in GNU Radio. By bypassing
the BLE stack, we embed a custom pseudo-noise (PN) sequence in the uncoded PHY
for correlation-based detection. Using a Yagi antenna and PlutoSDR, the
receiver performs digital beam sweeping to determine the tag's direction. Field
tests show reliable angular resolution at 50m and a communication range up to
360m. While our modulation increases receiver complexity, it enables future
improvements such as multichannel spreading and tag identification. The design
is fully open-source and provides a scalable framework for hornet tracking and
related applications in environmental monitoring.

### [4] [Approximate Message Passing for Multi-Preamble Detection in OTFS Random Access](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03980)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决OTFS信号中多前导检测的挑战，将其建模为复数域的结构化稀疏恢复问题。

Method: 设计了一种新的AMP算法，强制双重稀疏性（前导稀疏选择与OTFS信号在延迟多普勒域的固有稀疏性），并推导了非可分离复数稀疏约束的新AMP去噪器。

Result: 仿真表明，该方法在检测性能上优于现有技术，表现鲁棒且显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 提出的AMP算法在OTFS多前导检测中表现出色，优于现有技术。

Abstract: This article addresses the problem of multiple preamble detection in random
access systems based on orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signaling. This
challenge is formulated as a structured sparse recovery problem in the complex
domain. To tackle it, the authors propose a new approximate message passing
(AMP) algorithm that enforces double sparsity: the sparse selection of
preambles and the inherent sparsity of OTFS signals in the delay-Doppler
domain. From an algorithmic standpoint, the non-separable complex sparsity
constraint necessitates a careful derivation and leads to the design of a novel
AMP denoiser. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
robust detection performance and delivers significant gains over
state-of-the-art techniques.

### [5] [Joint Frequency-Space Sparse Reconstruction for DOA Estimation under Coherent Sources and Amplitude-Phase Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03983)

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法在相干源场景下的估计精度优于多种基准方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过频域-空域联合稀疏重构，有效提升了DOA估计的精度和效率。

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a joint frequency-space sparse reconstruction
method for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, which effectively addresses
the issues arising from the existence of coherent sources and array
amplitude-phase errors. Specifically, by using an auxiliary source with known
angles, we first construct the real steering vectors (RSVs) based on the
spectral peaks of received signals in the frequency domain, which serve as a
complete basis matrix for compensation for amplitude-phase errors. Then, we
leverage the spectral sparsity of snapshot data in the frequency domain and the
spatial sparsity of incident directions to perform the DOA estimation according
to the sparse reconstruction method. The proposed method does not require
iterative optimization, hence exhibiting low computational complexity.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DOA estimation method achieves
higher estimation accuracy for coherent sources as compared to various
benchmark schemes.

### [6] [Robust MIMO Semantic Communication with Imperfect CSI via Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04005)
*Mingze Gong,Shuoyao Wang,Shijian Gao,Jia Yan,Suzhi Bi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HANA-JSCC的语义图像传输系统，通过适应信道矩阵和噪声来应对MIMO系统中的信道估计误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIMO语义通信系统假设信道矩阵估计完美，但在实际中因硬件和开销限制不现实，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了信道矩阵适配器与信道编解码器协作以适应信道状态信息不匹配，并采用两阶段训练策略解决病态问题。

Result: HANA-JSCC在不同噪声和估计误差水平下，性能比现有基准高0.40~0.54dB。

Conclusion: HANA-JSCC有效提升了语义图像传输系统在信道估计误差下的性能。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemComm) has emerged as a new communication paradigm.
To enhance efficiency, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology has
been further integrated into SemComm systems. However, existing MIMO SemComm
systems assume perfect channel matrix estimation for channel-adaptive joint
source-channel coding, which is impractical due to hardware and pilot overhead
constraints. In this paper, we propose a semantic image transmission system
with channel matrix and channel noise adaptation, named HANA-JSCC, to cope with
channel estimation errors in MIMO systems. We propose a channel matrix adaptor
that collaborates with the channel codec to adapt to misaligned channel state
information, thereby mitigating the impact of estimation errors. Since the
relationship between the estimated channel matrix and true channel matrix is
ill-posed (one-to-many), we further introduce a two-stage training strategy
with knowledge distillation to overcome the convergence difficulties caused by
the ill-posed problem. Comparing with the state-of-the-art benchmarks,
HANA-JSCC achieves $0.40\sim0.54$dB higher average performance across various
noise and estimation error levels in various datasets.

### [7] [Constellation Shaping for OFDM-ISAC Systems: From Theoretical Bounds to Practical Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04055)
*Benedikt Geiger,Fan Liu,Shihang Lu,Andrej Rode,Daniel Gil Gaviria,Charlotte Muth,Laurent Schmalen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在OFDM-based ISAC系统中通过星座整形同时提升传感与通信（S&C）性能的方法，提出了几何、概率和联合整形方案，并证明其优于传统调制方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC系统中传感与通信在调制格式上存在冲突需求，需要寻找一种灵活的性能权衡方案。

Method: 采用自编码器优化几何、概率和联合星座整形，并提出适用于ISAC的广义概率幅度整形（PAS）及其低复杂度实现。

Result: 星座整形能灵活权衡S&C性能，接近理论上限，显著优于传统调制方式；广义PAS结合传统方法可低成本接近联合整形性能。

Conclusion: 星座整形尤其是广义PAS为实现低复杂度、高性能的ISAC系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) promises new use cases for
mobile communication systems by reusing the communication signal for radar-like
sensing. However, sensing and communications (S&C) impose conflicting
requirements on the modulation format, resulting in a tradeoff between their
corresponding performance. This paper investigates constellation shaping as a
means to simultaneously improve S&C performance in orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC systems. We begin by deriving how the
transmit symbols affect detection performance and derive theoretical lower and
upper bounds on the maximum achievable information rate under a given sensing
constraint. Using an autoencoder-based optimization, we investigate geometric,
probabilistic, and joint constellation shaping, where joint shaping combines
both approaches, employing both optimal maximum a-posteriori decoding and
practical bit-metric decoding. Our results show that constellation shaping
enables a flexible trade-off between S&C, can approach the derived upper bound,
and significantly outperforms conventional modulation formats. Motivated by its
practical implementation feasibility, we review probabilistic amplitude shaping
(PAS) and propose a generalization tailored to ISAC. For this generalization,
we propose a low-complexity log-likelihood ratio computation with negligible
rate loss. We demonstrate that combining conventional and generalized PAS
enables a flexible and low-complexity tradeoff between S&C, closely approaching
the performance of joint constellation shaping.

### [8] [Reliable Clutter Suppression for Slow-Moving Weak Target Radar Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04309)
*R. Zhang,J. Xue,T. Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reliable slow-moving weak target detection in complicated environments is
challenging due to the masking effects from the surrounding strong reflectors.
The traditional Moving Target Indication (MTI) may suppress the echoes from not
only the static interference objects (IOs), but also the desired slow-moving
weak target. According to the low-rank and sparse properties of the
range-velocity maps across different radar scans, a novel clutter suppression
scheme based on the Go decomposition (Godec) framework is proposed in this
paper. The simulation results show that with the existence of masking effects,
the target detection scheme based on Godec clutter suppression can reliably
detect the slow-moving weak target, compared to the traditional MTI-based
scheme. Besides, the time consumption comparison is conducted, demonstrating
that the proposed solution is one that sacrifices time complexity in exchange
for enhanced reliability. Additionally, the tradeoffs among the number of false
alarm cells, the detection probability and the iteration times for convergence
have been revealed, guiding parameter settings of the proposed solution in
practical applications. Experiment validation is also conducted to verify the
proposed solution, providing further insight into the scenarios where the
solution is most applicable.

### [9] [Relative Localization of UAV Swarms in GNSS-Denied Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04412)

Result: 实验表明，该方法在大规模群和范围信息丢失情况下减少了定位误差，并探讨了信号参数对通信与定位性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了无人机群在恶劣环境中的定位精度，同时揭示了通信与定位性能之间的相互影响。

Abstract: Relative localization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in global
navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied environments is essential for
emergency rescue and battlefield reconnaissance. Existing methods suffer from
significant localization errors among UAVs due to packet loss and high
computational complexity in large swarms. This paper proposes a
clustering-based framework where the UAVs simultaneously use communication
signals for channel estimation and ranging. Firstly, the spectral clustering is
utilized to divide the UAV swarm into different sub-clusters, where matrix
completion and multidimensional scaling yield high-precision relative
coordinates. Subsequently, a global map is created by the inter-cluster anchor
fusion. A case study of UAV integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) system
is presented, where the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is adopted for
ranging and communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method
reduces localization errors in large swarms and loss of range information. It
also explores the impact of signal parameters on communication and
localization, highlighting the interplay between communication and localization
performance.

### [10] [Self-Organizing Aerial Swarm Robotics for Resilient Load Transportation : A Table-Mechanics-Inspired Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03563)
*Quan Quan,Jiwen Xu,Runxiao Liu,Yi Ding,Jiaxing Che,Kai-Yuan Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种仿物理学的无人机群协同运输方法，具有去中心化和强鲁棒性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该方法将群体智能与力学稳定性结合，为复杂环境下的协同运输提供可扩展方案。

Abstract: In comparison with existing approaches, which struggle with scalability,
communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures, cooperative
aerial transportation via robot swarms holds transformative potential for
logistics and disaster response. Here, we present a physics-inspired
cooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the
dissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a
decentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous
formation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of
explicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended
payload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to
energy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control
system is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors
of the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches
under the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and
payload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying
robots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success
rate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,
and 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor
winds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges
swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable
framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex
transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Result: 仿真和实物实验表明，该模型能够可靠地识别可行的抓取配置，并具有实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 该框架在多样化的环境和物体几何条件下表现出良好的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decision-making in cooperative grasping for
two-robot object transport in constrained environments. The core of the
framework is a Conditional Embedding (CE) model consisting of two neural
networks that map grasp configuration information into an embedding space. The
resulting embedding vectors are then used to identify feasible grasp
configurations that allow two robots to collaboratively transport an object. To
ensure generalizability across diverse environments and object geometries, the
neural networks are trained on a dataset comprising a range of environment maps
and object shapes. We employ a supervised learning approach with negative
sampling to ensure that the learned embeddings effectively distinguish between
feasible and infeasible grasp configurations. Evaluation results across a wide
range of environments and objects in simulations demonstrate the model's
ability to reliably identify feasible grasp configurations. We further validate
the framework through experiments on a physical robotic platform, confirming
its practical applicability.

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset上达到minADE 0.25，性能领先。

Conclusion: 研究表明，多步稀疏路径比单点目标更能实现高保真战术执行，模拟人类驾驶行为。

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

Abstract: Accurate real-time buoyancy modeling is essential for high-fidelity
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) simulations, yet NVIDIA Isaac Sim lacks a
native buoyancy system, requiring external solutions for precise underwater
physics. This paper presents a novel convex hull-based approach to dynamically
compute the submerged volume of an AUV in real time. By extracting mesh
geometry from the simulation environment and calculating the hull portion
intersecting the water level along the z-axis, our method enhances accuracy
over traditional geometric approximations. A cross-sectional area extension
reduces computational overhead, enabling efficient buoyant force updates that
adapt to orientation, depth, and sinusoidal wave fluctuations (+-0.3 m). Tested
on a custom AUV design for SAUVC 2025, this approach delivers real-time

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Quadruped-based mobile manipulation presents significant challenges in
robotics due to the diversity of required skills, the extended task horizon,
and partial observability. After presenting a multi-stage pick-and-place task
as a succinct yet sufficiently rich setup that captures key desiderata for
quadruped-based mobile manipulation, we propose an approach that can train a
visuo-motor policy entirely in simulation, and achieve nearly 80\% success in
the real world. The policy efficiently performs search, approach, grasp,
transport, and drop into actions, with emerged behaviors such as re-grasping
and task chaining. We conduct an extensive set of real-world experiments with
ablation studies highlighting key techniques for efficient training and
effective sim-to-real transfer. Additional experiments demonstrate deployment

### [17] [Reactive In-Air Clothing Manipulation with Confidence-Aware Dense Correspondence and Visuotactile Affordance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03889)
*Neha Sunil,Megha Tippur,Arnau Saumell,Edward Adelson,Alberto Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉和触觉的双臂系统，用于直接操作褶皱和悬挂的衣物，通过感知不确定性和实时触觉反馈提高操作成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 衣物操作的复杂性（如配置多变、材料动态性和自遮挡）促使开发更高效的系统。

Method: 结合置信度感知的密集视觉对应模型和触觉监督的抓取可用性网络，通过反应式状态机和实时触觉验证实现操作。

Result: 系统能够处理高度遮挡的桌面和空中配置，展示了在折叠和悬挂任务中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该系统为衣物操作提供了通用且可扩展的解决方案，并为其他规划模式提供了可重复使用的中间表示。

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

*Branimir Ćaran,Vladimir Milić,Marko Švaco,Bojan Jerbić*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 设计了一种基于多模态测量的姿态估计器，用于四轮独立转向和驱动的爬墙机器人，融合了轮式里程计、视觉里程计和IMU数据，采用EKF和UKF滤波算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 爬墙机器人需要精确的姿态信息以执行建筑测量和维护任务，但传统定位传感器在建筑环境下不可靠，因此需依赖机器人里程计，但其易受漂移影响。

Method: 结合EKF和UKF算法融合多模态数据，并通过非线性优化、Levenberg-Marquardt、遗传算法和粒子群算法校准机器人参数。

Result: 在校准方法和姿态估计器的实验中验证了性能，实验基于爬墙机器人平台。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态融合方法有效解决了爬墙机器人姿态估计问题，校准方法优化了系统性能。

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a pose estimator for a four wheel
independent steer four wheel independent drive (4WIS4WID) wall climbing mobile
robot, based on the fusion of multimodal measurements, including wheel
odometry, visual odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The pose
estimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their
operational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and
maintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the
building at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material
properties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors
such as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing
robots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these
environments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and
electromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary
source of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift
caused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the
robot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and
Levenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting
methods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as
stochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and
results of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail
with experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot.

Result: 在多个仿真平台和机器人上表现优于现有模型，显著提升任务成功率。

Conclusion: FPC-VLA展示了强大的泛化能力和实际应用价值，为构建更可靠的自主系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However,
traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks
due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial
mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these
challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with
a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates
action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective
strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A
similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past
predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and
LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly
increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful
real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong
generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous
systems.

Abstract: While current onboard state estimation methods are adequate for most driving

interaction between tires and road surfaces. This paper explores a novel
communication concept for efficiently transmitting integrated wheel sensor data
from an ESP32 microcontroller. Our proposed approach utilizes a
publish-subscribe system, surpassing comparable solutions in the literature
regarding data transmission volume. We tested this approach on a drum tire test
rig with our prototype sensors system utilizing a diverse selection of sample
frequencies between 1 Hz and 32 000 Hz to demonstrate the efficacy of our
communication concept. The implemented prototype sensor showcases minimal data
loss, approximately 0.1 % of the sampled data, validating the reliability of
our developed communication system. This work contributes to advancing
real-time data acquisition, providing insights into optimizing integrated wheel
sensor communication.

*Hongyin Zhang,Shiyuan Zhang,Junxi Jin,Qixin Zeng,Yifan Qiao,Hongchao Lu,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ARFM的离线强化学习微调算法，通过自适应调整VLA流模型的损失缩放因子，优化控制RL信号对流损失的影响，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于流匹配的VLA模型在复杂任务中动作准确性不足，原因是其仅依赖模仿学习的后训练范式，难以深入理解数据质量的分布特性。

Method: 提出了离线RL后训练目标，并设计了ARFM算法，通过自适应调整缩放因子来平衡RL优势保留和流损失梯度方差控制。

Result: 模拟和真实实验表明，ARFM在泛化性、鲁棒性、少样本学习和持续学习方面表现优异。

Conclusion: ARFM通过自适应平衡RL信号和流损失，显著提升了VLA模型的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合示范的高效探索深度强化学习框架DRLR，通过改进动作选择模块和采用SAC策略来减少引导误差和过拟合，验证了其在多任务和实际工业机器人任务中的有效性。


<details>

Motivation: 旨在解决传统强化学习在机器人任务中探索效率低、引导误差大和易过拟合的问题，提升任务学习的效果和鲁棒性。

Method: 基于IBRL算法，改进动作选择模块以校准Q值，采用SAC策略防止策略收敛至次优解，并在模拟和实际机器人任务中进行验证。

Result: 实验表明DRLR能够有效减少引导误差和过拟合，在高低维度任务和不同质量示范下均表现优异，并在真实轮式装载机上成功部署。

Conclusion: DRLR框架通过改进动作选择和策略优化，显著提升了机器人任务学习的效率和鲁棒性，适用于模拟和实际场景。

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

Method: 利用点云嵌入和关键点序列预测，通过学习规划器生成的数据集，优化模型性能。

Result: 即使未使用点云编码，模型在运行时间上优于数值模型一个数量级，测试集成功率高达90%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在运动规划中显示高效潜力，尽管点云嵌入的调节仍需改进。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在物体覆盖率和熵方面与基线方法无显著差异，但速度快约九倍。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算效率高的替代方案，适用于实际机器人应用中的物体重建任务。

Abstract: Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various
robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of
the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects
efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.
Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating
potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,
these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several
candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally
efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most
informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the
camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the
whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint
without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and
realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying
sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning
strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world
experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed
method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no
significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method
is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in
terms of the average time the robot spends between views.

Abstract: Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics
applications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive
tasks, facilitating data sharing, and enhancing robot coordination. However,
integrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to
network latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource
management. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for
testing cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main
components enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud
cluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system
incorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling
bidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot
simulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To
achieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for
aerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce
artificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions
encountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续体机器人因其灵活性和适应性适用于非结构化环境，但其连续变形的形态对运动规划与控制提出了挑战，需要轻量级且准确的模型。

Method: 使用基于几何非线性梁理论的哈密顿原理推导出解析正向模型，避免显式建模电缆与主干的接触，适用于力和位移输入的统一建模。

Result: 数值模拟验证了模型的准确性，并开发了半解析迭代方案用于逆运动学。模型适用于非均匀几何和分布式载荷，计算高效。

Conclusion: LASEM框架为连续体机器人的实时控制提供了轻量级且通用的解决方案，无需显式接触建模。

Abstract: Continuum robots, inspired by octopus arms and elephant trunks, combine
dexterity with intrinsic compliance, making them well suited for unstructured
and confined environments. Yet their continuously deformable morphology poses
challenges for motion planning and control, calling for accurate but
lightweight models. We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling
(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation
potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical
forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via
Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone
contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying
kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the
framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,
distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally
efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a
semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To
address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the
functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally
incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants
demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic
alignment with natural hand motion.

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that

of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision

environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection

Abstract: This brief, aimed at practitioners, offers an analysis of the effect of
sampling-time jitter, i. e., the error produced by execution-time inaccuracies.
We propose reinterpreting jitter-afflicted linear time-invariant systems
through equivalent jitter-free analogs. By constructing a perceived system that
absorbs the effects of timing perturbations into its dynamics, we find an
affine scaling of jitter. We examine both measurement and implementation
scenarios, demonstrating that the presence of jitter effectively scales the
system matrices. Moreover, we observe that, in the Laplace domain, jitter can
be interpreted as a frequency scaling.

Motivation: 针对强化学习（RL）需要大量试验学习任务的缺点，研究提出了替代方案以避免意外障碍。

Method: 采用Dubins' car模型，结合平坦控制和HEOL反馈设置，以及最新的模型自由预测控制方法。

Result: 实验结果显示模型基方法表现略优，但模型自由方法对随机干扰表现出更强鲁棒性，且计算负担低。

Conclusion: 提出的两种方法在避免障碍任务中表现优于流行的机器学习技术，且计算效率高。

Abstract: This communication on collision avoidance with unexpected obstacles is
motivated by some critical appraisals on reinforcement learning (RL) which
"requires ridiculously large numbers of trials to learn any new task" (Yann
LeCun). We use the classic Dubins' car in order to replace RL with
flatness-based control, combined with the HEOL feedback setting, and the latest
model-free predictive control approach. The two approaches lead to convincing
computer experiments where the results with the model-based one are only
slightly better. They exhibit a satisfactory robustness with respect to
randomly generated mismatches/disturbances, which become excellent in the
model-free case. Those properties would have been perhaps difficult to obtain
with today's popular machine learning techniques in AI. Finally, we should
emphasize that our two methods require a low computational burden.

Result: 提出的框架在仿真中展示了有效性，同时提供了安全约束对名义跟踪目标影响的额外分析。

Conclusion: 该框架为处理非线性系统的多约束控制问题提供了可行的解决方案，并通过理论和仿真验证了其性能。

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for the constrained
control of nonlinear systems; however, the majority of results in the
literature focus on systems subject to a single CBF constraint, making it
challenging to synthesize provably safe controllers that handle multiple state
constraints. This paper presents a framework for constrained control of
nonlinear systems subject to box constraints on the systems' vector-valued
outputs using multiple CBFs. Our results illustrate that when the output has a
vector relative degree, the CBF constraints encoding these box constraints are
compatible, and the resulting optimization-based controller is locally
Lipschitz continuous and admits a closed-form expression. Additional results
are presented to characterize the degradation of nominal tracking objectives in
the presence of safety constraints. Simulations of a planar quadrotor are
presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

Abstract: The synthesis of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) often involves demanding
computations or a meticulous construction. However, structural properties of
the system dynamics and constraints have the potential to mitigate these
challenges. In this paper, we explore how equivariances in the dynamics,
loosely speaking a form of symmetry, can be leveraged in the CBF synthesis.
Although CBFs are generally not inherently symmetric, we show how equivariances
in the dynamics and symmetries in the constraints induce symmetries in CBFs
derived through reachability analysis. This insight allows us to infer their
CBF values across the entire domain from their values on a subset, leading to
significant computational savings. Interestingly, equivariances can be even
leveraged to the CBF synthesis for non-symmetric constraints. Specifically, we
show how a partially known CBF can be leveraged together with equivariances to
construct a CBF for various new constraints. Throughout the paper, we provide
examples illustrating the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a numerical study
investigates the computational gains from invoking equivariances into the CBF
synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全数据驱动的运动规划框架，用于多智能体系统在共享障碍物环境中的安全导航，无需显式系统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统在未知环境中安全协同运动的挑战，避免显式模型依赖和实时计算负担。

Method: 每个智能体通过解决凸半定规划学习闭环行为，生成局部不变椭球体和安全状态反馈增益，结合采样规划器构建安全轨迹树。

Result: 仿真验证了框架在多智能体同步运动中的有效性，实现了动态可行性和安全性的双重保障。

Conclusion: 基于数据和凸优化的方法为多智能体系统提供了高效、安全的运动规划解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.

TL;DR: 通过集成YOLO深度学习和多光谱数据，提升无人机对风电场缺陷检测的准确性，比单一模型表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用无人机和先进传感器监测风电场关键部件，但高分辨率数据和多光谱图像处理需求高，需开发更可靠的方法。

Method: 提出集成YOLOv8通用模型与专用热成像模型的融合方法，采用复杂边界框融合算法结合预测结果。

Result: 实验表明，集成模型的平均精度（mAP@.5）达0.93，F1分数为0.90，优于单一模型（mAP@.5为0.91）。

Conclusion: 多YOLO架构与多光谱数据融合提供了更可靠的解决方案，提升了视觉和热缺陷的检测能力。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算子（NO）在科学计算中日益重要，但其表征性质仍未充分探索，本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出了一种扩展稀疏自编码器的框架，比较了SAE、提升SAE和SAE神经算子的推理和训练动态。

Result: 提升和算子模块引入了有益的归纳偏置，实现了更快的恢复、平滑概念的更好恢复以及跨分辨率的鲁棒推理。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经算子的机制解释性提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于神经表征的重叠和非线性肢体间交互作用，解码双手机械运动在脑机接口中仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: BiND采用两阶段方法：首先分类运动类型（单左、单右或双手），然后使用基于GRU的专用解码器预测连续2D手速。

Result: BiND在单手和双手轨迹预测中分别达到0.76和0.69的平均R²，优于其他六种先进模型，并在跨会话分析中表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BiND展示了任务感知判别和时间建模在增强双手机械运动解码中的有效性。

Abstract: Decoding bimanual hand movements from intracortical recordings remains a
critical challenge for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), due to overlapping
neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions. We introduce BiND
(Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first
classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then
uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time
index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six
state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a
publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient.
BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69
($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model
(GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session
variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up
to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the
effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing
bimanual decoding.

Abstract: Restoring naturalistic finger control in assistive technologies requires the
continuous decoding of motor intent with high accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness. Here, we present a spike-based decoding framework that integrates
spiking neural networks (SNNs) with motor unit activity extracted from
high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays. We demonstrate simultaneous
and proportional decoding of individual finger forces from motor unit spike
trains during isometric contractions at 15% of maximum voluntary contraction
using SNNs. We systematically evaluated alternative SNN decoder configurations
and compared two possible input modalities: physiologically grounded motor unit
spike trains and spike-encoded intramuscular EMG signals. Through this
comparison, we quantified trade-offs between decoding accuracy, memory
footprint, and robustness to input errors. The results showed that shallow SNNs
can reliably decode finger-level motor intent with competitive accuracy and
minimal latency, while operating with reduced memory requirements and without
the need for external preprocessing buffers. This work provides a practical
blueprint for integrating SNNs into finger-level force decoding systems,
demonstrating how the choice of input representation can be strategically
tailored to meet application-specific requirements for accuracy, robustness,
and memory efficiency.

TL;DR: 社交机器人在健康辅导中扮演重要角色，但用户隐私问题未充分研究。本文探讨信息透明度、用户控制力和机器人行为方式对隐私感知的影响，结果表明用户控制力是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交机器人在健康辅导中的应用增多，用户隐私问题日益突出，但缺乏系统研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，探究哪些因素影响用户的隐私感知。

Method: 通过在线研究（N=200），系统测试信息透明度、用户控制力和机器人行为方式（主动或被动）对隐私感知的影响。

Result: 用户即使允许机器人访问数据，仍期望控制信息的解释和共享方式。提供控制的实验组在隐私适切性和信任度上显著更高。透明度和主动性影响较小。

Conclusion: 仅告知用户或机器人主动行为不足以保证隐私感知，用户控制力至关重要。未来需研究如何让用户在机器人信息处理中享有更多管理权。

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly recognized as valuable supporters in the field
of well-being coaching. They can function as independent coaches or provide
support alongside human coaches, and healthcare professionals. In coaching
interactions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,
making privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the
factors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine
three key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,
(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their
information, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts
proactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =
200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,
they additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information
is interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that
provided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived
privacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of
transparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,
and we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing
users or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.
These insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that
allow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially
when social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans.
