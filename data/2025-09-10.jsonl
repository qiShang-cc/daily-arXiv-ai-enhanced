Usually, a fully autonomous system for the\ncollection and transportation of multiple trolleys is based on a\nLeader-Follower formation of mobile manipulators, where reliable docking\nmaneuvers of the mobile base are essential to align trolleys into organized\nqueues. However, developing a vision-based robotic docking system faces\nsignificant challenges: high precision requirements, environmental\ndisturbances, and inherent robot constraints. To address these challenges, we\npropose an optimization-based Visual Servoing scheme that incorporates active\ninfrared markers for robust feature extraction across diverse lighting\nconditions. This framework explicitly models nonholonomic kinematics and\nvisibility constraints within the Hybrid Visual Servoing problem, augmented\nwith an observer for disturbance rejection to ensure precise and stable\ndocking. Experimental results across diverse environments demonstrate the\nrobustness of this system, with quantitative evaluations confirming high\ndocking accuracy."}

To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative\nexploration framework for a marsupial ground-aerial robot team that leverages\nthe complementary capabilities of both platforms. The framework employs a\ngraph-based path planning algorithm to guide exploration and deploy the aerial\nrobot in areas where its expected gain significantly exceeds that of the ground\nrobot, such as large open spaces or regions inaccessible to the ground\nplatform, thereby maximizing coverage and efficiency. To facilitate large-scale\nspatial information sharing, we introduce a bandwidth-efficient, task-driven\nmap compression strategy. This method enables each robot to reconstruct\nresolution-specific volumetric maps while preserving exploration-critical\ndetails, even at high compression rates. By selectively compressing and sharing\nkey data, communication overhead is minimized, ensuring effective map\nintegration for collaborative path planning.

Active listening\nand backchanneling could be one way to enhance robots' communicative\ncapabilities and enhance their effectiveness in eliciting deeper\nself-disclosure, providing a sense of empathy,and forming positive rapport and\nrelationships with people.Thus, we developed an LLM-powered social robot that\ncan exhibit contextually appropriate sentiment-based backchannelingand active\nlistening behaviors (active listening+backchanneling) and compared its efficacy\nin eliciting people's self-disclosurein comparison to robots that do not\nexhibit any of these listening behaviors (control) and a robot that only\nexhibitsbackchanneling behavior (backchanneling-only). Through ourexperimental\nstudy with sixty-five participants, we found theparticipants who conversed with\nthe active listening robot per-ceived the interactions more positively, in\nwhich they exhibited the highest self-disclosures, and reported the strongest\nsenseof being listened to. The results of our study suggest that the\nimplementation of active listening behaviors in social robotshas the potential\nto improve human-robot communication andcould further contribute to the\nbuilding of deeper human-robot relationships and rapport."}

Young"], "title": "Knowledge Isn't Power: The Ethics of Social Robots and the Difficulty of Informed Consent", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.RO"], "comment": "Submitted to the International Journal of Social Robotics. 18 pages,\n  1 figure", "summary": "Contemporary robots are increasingly mimicking human social behaviours to\nfacilitate interaction, such as smiling to signal approachability, or\nhesitating before taking an action to allow people time to react. Such\ntechniques can activate a person's entrenched social instincts, triggering\nemotional responses as though they are interacting with a fellow human, and can\nprompt them to treat a robot as if it truly possesses the underlying life-like\nprocesses it outwardly presents, raising significant ethical questions. We\nengage these issues through the lens of informed consent: drawing upon\nprevailing legal principles and ethics, we examine how social robots can\ninfluence user behaviour in novel ways, and whether under those circumstances\nusers can be appropriately informed to consent to these heightened\ninteractions. We explore the complex circumstances of human-robot interaction\nand highlight how it differs from more familiar interaction contexts, and we\napply legal principles relating to informed consent to social robots in order\nto reconceptualize the current ethical debates surrounding the field. From this\ninvestigation, we synthesize design goals for robot developers to achieve more\nethical and informed human-robot interaction."}
