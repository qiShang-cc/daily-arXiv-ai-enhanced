Although analog solutions\nare computationally efficient, they often come with system design drawbacks\nwhich limit waveform flexibility and can result in an overall increase of\nsystem complexity. With improvements in modern general compute systems,\nreal-time digital signal processing is becoming more realizable using\nnon-radar-specific high-performance compute. In this paper, we present an\nanalysis of general Doppler and ionospheric correction algorithms for arbitrary\nwaveforms for radar digital signal processing. We also include considerations\nfor efficient implementation of these algorithms in software, specifically\nusing GPU hardware. This analysis includes metrics of performance such as\nexecution time and error correction accuracy. We also provide recommendations\nfor application in radar signal processing. We identify two algorithms for\ndispersion correction: an FFT-based method for ionospheric dispersion and a\nnumerical interpolation method via sinc interpolation for Doppler dispersion.\nBoth of these algorithms are able to compensate for dispersion equivalent in\naccuracy to waveform-specific analytical methods and were able to be performed\nin real-time on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.

However, the radio environment is unpredictable\nand often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods\nis often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the\nreceiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing\ndistributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect\nthe presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)\nare deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,\nRIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem\nis modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping\nof received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating\nthe optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting\nreceived signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may\npotentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable\neffective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss\nfunction that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio\n(SINR) of the received signals.

The\nfirst method addresses the estimation of frequencies and amplitudes in\nmultidimensional exponential models. It utilizes localized trigonometric\npolynomial kernels to detect the multivariate frequencies, followed by a more\ndetailed parameter estimation. We compare our method with MUSIC and ESPRIT,\nwhich are classical subspace-based algorithms widely used for estimating the\nparameters of exponential signals. In the univariate case, the method\noutperforms MUSIC and ESPRIT under low signal-to-noise ratios. For the\nmultivariate case, we develop a coordinate-wise projection and registration\napproach that achieves high recovery accuracy using significantly fewer samples\nthan other methods.\n  The second method focuses on separating linear chirp components from\ntime-localized signal segments. A variant of the Signal Separation Operator\n(SSO) is constructed using a localized kernel. Instantaneous frequency\nestimates are obtained via FFT-based filtering, then clustered and fitted with\npiecewise linear regression. The method operates without prior knowledge of the\nnumber of components and is shown to recover intersecting and discontinuous\nchirps at SNR levels as low as -30 dB.\n  Both methods share an idea based on localized kernels and efficient FFT-based\nimplementation, and neither requires subspace decomposition or sparsity\nregularization.
