### [1] [FAS-ARIS: Turning Multipath Challenges Into Localization Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12348)
*Hua Chen,Tao Gong,Tuo Wu,Maged Elkashlan,Baiyang Liu,Chan-Byoung Chae,Kin-Fai Tong,Kai-Kit Wong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的FAS-ARIS框架，将多径效应转化为资源，实现高精度的3D定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SISO系统在多径环境下难以实现精确的3D定位，因此需要一种新方法将多径效应从阻碍转变为优势。

Method: 结合ARIS的信号放大能力和FAS的空间分集，设计专用信号解耦策略和多阶段估计算法，包括MUSIC算法和最大似然估计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，FAS-ARIS框架在多径环境下实现了接近最优的定位精度。

Conclusion: 通过充分利用多径效应，FAS-ARIS框架有效解决了传统3D定位的局限性。

Abstract: Traditional single-input single-output (SISO) systems face fundamental
limitations in achieving accurate three-dimensional (3D) localization due to
limited spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) and the adverse impact of multipath
propagation. This paper proposes a novel fluid antenna system (FAS)-active
reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) framework that transforms multipath
effects from a hindrance into a resource for enhanced localization. By
synergistically combining the signal amplification capabilities of ARIS with
the spatial diversity enabled by FAS, the proposed system achieves robust 3D
user equipment (UE) positioning -- without relying on auxiliary information
such as time-of-arrival (ToA) or frequency diversity. The system exploits both
line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components through a tailored
signal decoupling strategy. We design novel UE pilot sequences and ARIS phase
configurations to effectively separate LoS and NLoS channels, enabling
independent parameter estimation. A multi-stage estimation algorithm is then
applied: the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm estimates
angle-of-arrival (AoA) from the direct path, while maximum likelihood
estimation with interior-point refinement recovers cascaded channel parameters
from the reflected path. Finally, geometric triangulation using least-squares
estimation determines the UE's 3D position based on the extracted AoA
information. Comprehensive performance analysis, including the derivation of
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds for both channel and position estimation, establishes
theoretical benchmarks. Simulation results confirm that the proposed FAS-ARIS
framework achieves near-optimal localization accuracy while maintaining
robustness in rich multipath environments -- effectively turning conventional
localization challenges into advantages.

*Henry Carvajal Mora,Nathaly Orozco,Fernando Almeida García,José Vega-Sánchez,Felipe Grijalva,Edgar Benitez Olivo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在未来移动网络中，通过物理层安全（PLS）和部分保密机制解决资源有限设备的信息安全问题。论文分析了广义多簇波动双射线（MFTR）衰落模型下的部分保密性能，并推导了关键保密指标的解析解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来的移动网络中，资源有限的设备在保障信息安全方面面临挑战。物理层安全提供了一种利用无线信道随机性的解决方案，尤其是在无法实现完全保密时，部分保密成为一种现实选择。

Method: 论文研究了发射器、合法接收者和窃听者组成的系统，使用MFTR衰落模型和最大比合并（MRC）技术。通过推导广义保密中断概率（GSOP）、平均部分混淆（AFE）和平均信息泄漏率（AILR）的精确和近似封闭式解来评估性能。

Result: 结果表明，MFTR模型的灵活性使其能够全面评估不同衰落条件下的性能。同时，合法接收者的更多MRC分支增强了保密性能，但其效果取决于发射器与窃听者链路的特性。

Conclusion: 论文验证了部分保密机制在实际系统中的有效性，并证明了MFTR模型及其推导的保密指标在评估复杂衰落条件下的实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: Securing information in future mobile networks is challenging, especially for
devices with limited computational resources. Physical layer security (PLS)
offers a viable solution by leveraging wireless channel randomness. When full
secrecy is unattainable, the partial secrecy regime provides a realistic
alternative. This work analyzes partial secrecy performance under the
generalized multicluster fluctuating two-ray (MFTR) fading model, which
subsumes many classical fading cases. We study a system with a transmitter (A),
legitimate receiver (B), and eavesdropper (E), both B and E using antenna
arrays with maximal ratio combining (MRC), under i.n.i.d. fading. Exact and
closed-form approximations are derived for key secrecy metrics: generalized
secrecy outage probability (GSOP), average fractional equivocation (AFE), and
average information leakage rate (AILR). The results, validated by Monte Carlo
simulations, retain constant complexity regardless of diversity order. The MFTR
model's flexibility enables comprehensive assessment across fading conditions,
showing that more MRC branches at B enhance secrecy performance depending on
the A-E link characteristics.

### [3] [Self-Supervised and Topological Signal-Quality Assessment for Any PPG Device](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12510)
*Wei Shao,Ruoyu Zhang,Zequan Liang,Ehsan Kourkchi,Setareh Rafatirad,Houman Homayoun*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自监督学习和拓扑数据分析的无监督信号质量评估方法，用于手腕PPG信号的跨设备质量检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPG信号质量评估方法依赖人工规则或数据密集型监督模型，效果有限且不稳定。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）使用对比学习的1-D ResNet-18训练无监督嵌入；2）通过持续同调转换嵌入为拓扑签名并用HDBSCAN聚类，生成二进制信号质量指数。

Result: 在不重新调参的情况下，该方法在10,000个窗口样本上的Silhouette、Davies-Bouldin和Calinski-Harabasz得分分别为0.72、0.34和6173。

Conclusion: 提出的SSL-TDA框架实现了无需标注数据的PPG信号质量评估，具有跨设备和可扩展的优势。

Abstract: Wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) is embedded in billions of devices, yet
its optical waveform is easily corrupted by motion, perfusion loss, and ambient
light, jeopardizing downstream cardiometric analytics. Existing signal-quality
assessment (SQA) methods rely either on brittle heuristics or on data-hungry
supervised models. We introduce the first fully unsupervised SQA pipeline for
wrist PPG. Stage 1 trains a contrastive 1-D ResNet-18 on 276 h of raw,
unlabeled data from heterogeneous sources (varying in device and sampling
frequency), yielding optical-emitter- and motion-invariant embeddings (i.e.,
the learned representation is stable across differences in LED wavelength,
drive intensity, and device optics, as well as wrist motion). Stage 2 converts
each 512-D encoder embedding into a 4-D topological signature via persistent
homology (PH) and clusters these signatures with HDBSCAN. To produce a binary
signal-quality index (SQI), the acceptable PPG signals are represented by the
densest cluster while the remaining clusters are assumed to mainly contain
poor-quality PPG signals. Without re-tuning, the SQI attains Silhouette,
Davies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz scores of 0.72, 0.34, and 6173,
respectively, on a stratified sample of 10,000 windows. In this study, we
propose a hybrid self-supervised-learning--topological-data-analysis (SSL--TDA)
framework that offers a drop-in, scalable, cross-device quality gate for PPG
signals.

*Zequan Liang,Ruoyu Zhang,Wei Shao,krishna Karthik,Ehsan Kourkchi,Setareh Rafatirad,Houman Homayoun*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于迁移学习的低功耗可穿戴设备SpO2估计方法，显著优于传统校准和机器学习基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SpO2估计方法依赖复杂临床校准，不适合低功耗可穿戴应用。

Method: 使用双通道25Hz PPG数据，先预训练BiLSTM+自注意力模型，再用可穿戴设备数据微调。

Result: MAE为2.967%（公共数据集）和2.624%（私有数据集），功耗降低40%。

Conclusion: 无需临床校准即可实现精确低功耗SpO2监测。

Abstract: Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) is a vital marker for healthcare monitoring.
Traditional SpO2 estimation methods often rely on complex clinical calibration,
making them unsuitable for low-power, wearable applications. In this paper, we
propose a transfer learning-based framework for the rapid adaptation of SpO2
estimation to energy-efficient wearable devices using low-sampling-rate (25Hz)
dual-channel photoplethysmography (PPG). We first pretrain a bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model with self-attention on a public clinical
dataset, then fine-tune it using data collected from our wearable We-Be band
and an FDA-approved reference pulse oximeter. Experimental results show that
our approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.967% on the public
dataset and 2.624% on the private dataset, significantly outperforming
traditional calibration and non-transferred machine learning baselines.
Moreover, using 25Hz PPG reduces power consumption by 40% compared to 100Hz,
excluding baseline draw. Our method also attains an MAE of 3.284% in
instantaneous SpO2 prediction, effectively capturing rapid fluctuations. These
results demonstrate the rapid adaptation of accurate, low-power SpO2 monitoring
on wearable devices without the need for clinical calibration.

### [5] [Generalizable Blood Pressure Estimation from Multi-Wavelength PPG Using Curriculum-Adversarial Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12518)
*Zequan Liang,Ruoyu Zhang,Wei Shao,Mahdi Pirayesh Shirazi Nejad,Ehsan Kourkchi,Setareh Rafatirad,Houman Homayoun*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于课程对抗学习的通用血压估计框架，结合多波长PPG数据，通过严格的受试者级数据分割和对抗训练，实现了较高的血压估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确且泛化的血压估计对心血管疾病的早期检测和管理至关重要，尤其是在多波长PPG数据的背景下。

Method: 通过课程学习（从高血压分类过渡到血压回归）和领域对抗训练（混淆受试者身份以学习受试者不变特征）的结合，设计了一个通用框架。

Result: 在多波长PPG数据集上，方法在严格的受试者级分割下表现优异，SBP和DBP的MAE分别为14.2mmHg和6.4mmHg。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了多波长PPG数据和课程对抗策略在血压估计中的潜力，为准确且鲁棒的血压估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable blood pressure (BP) estimation is vital for the
early detection and management of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we
enforce subject-level data splitting on a public multi-wavelength
photoplethysmography (PPG) dataset and propose a generalizable BP estimation
framework based on curriculum-adversarial learning. Our approach combines
curriculum learning, which transitions from hypertension classification to BP
regression, with domain-adversarial training that confuses subject identity to
encourage the learning of subject-invariant features. Experiments show that
multi-channel fusion consistently outperforms single-channel models. On the
four-wavelength PPG dataset, our method achieves strong performance under
strict subject-level splitting, with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 14.2mmHg for
systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 6.4mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
Additionally, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of both the
curriculum and adversarial components. These results highlight the potential of
leveraging complementary information in multi-wavelength PPG and
curriculum-adversarial strategies for accurate and robust BP estimation.

Motivation: 探讨静态图信号的定义及其在多项式通道中的性质，并研究卡尔曼滤波如何有效结合动态系统和噪声结构。

Method: 通过多项式图通道生成静态图信号，并利用卡尔曼滤波处理动态系统中的多项式矩阵。

Result: 卡尔曼滤波在保持图信号静态性的同时，提供更准确和自适应的信号估计。

Conclusion: 卡尔曼滤波在静态图信号处理中表现出更强的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel definition of stationary graph signals,
formulated with respect to a symmetric graph shift, such as the graph
Laplacian. We show that stationary graph signals can be generated by
transmitting white noise through polynomial graph channels, and that their
stationarity is preserved under polynomial channel transmission.
  In this paper, we also investigate Kalman filtering to dynamical systems
characterized by polynomial state and observation matrices. We demonstrate that
Kalman filtering maintains the stationarity of graph signals, while effectively
incorporating both system dynamics and noise structure. In comparison to the
static inverse filtering method and naive zero-signal strategy, the Kalman
filtering procedure yields more accurate and adaptive signal estimates,
highlighting its robustness and versatility in graph signal processing.

Result: 实验结果表明，协同感知的数据融合方法显著提高了多目标的位置和速度估计精度。

Conclusion: BS与UE协同感知模式为扩展无线网络的感知模式提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising technique for
expanding the functionalities of wireless networks with enhanced spectral
efficiency. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined six basic
sensing operation modes in wireless networks. To further enhance the sensing
capability of wireless networks, this paper proposes a new sensing operation
mode, i.e., the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) cooperative sensing.
Specifically, after decoding the communication data, the UE further processes
the received signal to extract the target sensing information. We propose an
efficient algorithm for fusing the sensing results obtained by the BS and UE,
by exploiting the geometric relationship among BS, UE and targets as well as
the expected sensing quality in the BS monostatic and BS-UE bistatic sensing.
The results show that the proposed data fusion method for cooperative sensing
can effectively improve the position and velocity estimation accuracy of
multiple targets, and provide a new approach on the expansion of the sensing
pattern.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LSTM的可持续预编码框架，用于RIS辅助的毫米波MIMO系统，减少开销和复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统CSI估计的高开销和复杂性问题，同时考虑RIS硬件约束和多标签训练需求。

Method: 利用上行导频序列隐式学习信道特性，结合RIS相位依赖的幅度模型和多标签训练策略。

Result: 仿真显示，其频谱效率达到穷举搜索的90%以上，计算时间仅为其2.2%，能耗降低近两个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法在分布不匹配和大规模RIS阵列下仍表现稳健，是一种可持续且高效的6G无线网络解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based
precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state
information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to
implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and
inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by
incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a
multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal
codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed
design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES)
with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly
two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under
distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a
practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.

Method: 提出了一种基于扩展卡尔曼滤波的无人机跟踪方案，并联合优化预测轨迹、传感持续时间比和目标恒定信噪比。通过二阶泰勒展开近似中断概率，设计了两种算法（SCA和AO）解决非凸优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的算法能有效提升中断容量，并在路径损耗和波束覆盖之间揭示了权衡关系。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法和算法显著提升了无人机跟踪的通信可靠性，为ISAC技术在实际应用中的进一步研究提供了参考。

Abstract: Sensing-assisted predictive beamforming, as one of the enabling technologies
for emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm, shows
significant promise for enhancing various future unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
applications. However, current works predominately emphasized on spectral
efficiency enhancement, while the impact of such beamforming techniques on the
communication reliability was largely unexplored and challenging to
characterize. To fill this research gap and tackle this issue, this paper
investigates outage capacity maximization for UAV tracking under the
sensing-assisted predictive beamforming scheme. Specifically, a
cellular-connected UAV tracking scheme is proposed leveraging extended Kalman
filtering (EKF), where the predicted UAV trajectory, sensing duration ratio,
and target constant received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are jointly optimized
to maximize the outage capacity at each time slot. To address the implicit
nature of the objective function, closed-form approximations of the outage
probabilities (OPs) at both prediction and measurement stages of each time slot
are proposed based on second-order Taylor expansions, providing an efficient
and full characterization of outage capacity. Subsequently, an efficient
algorithm is proposed based on a combination of bisection search and successive
convex approximation (SCA) to address the non-convex optimization problem with
guaranteed convergence. To further reduce computational complexity, a second
efficient algorithm is developed based on alternating optimization (AO).
Simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived OP approximations, the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and the significant outage capacity
enhancement over various benchmarks, while also indicating a trade-off between
decreasing path loss and enjoying wide beam coverage for outage capacity
maximization.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于极大规模多输入多输出（XL-MIMO）系统中近场信道状态信息（CSI）反馈的高效变压器家族NEFT，通过轻量化变体适应不同硬件平台，显著提升了精度并降低了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在近场CSI反馈中难以捕获复杂结构且计算开销过高的问题，以满足下一代无线通信的需求。

Method: 基于分层视觉变压器（Vision Transformer）构建NEFT，推出轻量化变体（NEFT-Compact、NEFT-Hybrid、NEFT-Edge），结合多级知识蒸馏（KD）和无注意力编码技术。

Result: NEFT在归一化均方误差（NMSE）上比现有方法提升15-21 dB，轻量化变体将计算量减少25-36%，同时精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: NEFT为XL-MIMO系统中的近场CSI反馈提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems,
operating in the near-field region due to their massive antenna arrays, are a
key enabler of next-generation wireless communications but face significant
challenges in channel state information (CSI) feedback. Deep learning has
emerged as a powerful tool by learning compact CSI representations for
feedback. However, existing methods struggle to capture the intricate structure
of near-field CSI while incurring prohibitive computational overhead on
practical mobile devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose the
Near-Field Efficient Feedback Transformer (NEFT) family for accurate and
efficient near-field CSI feedback across diverse hardware platforms. Built on a
hierarchical Vision Transformer backbone, NEFT is extended with lightweight
variants to meet various deployment constraints: NEFT-Compact applies
multi-level knowledge distillation (KD) to reduce complexity while maintaining
accuracy, and NEFT-Hybrid and NEFT-Edge address encoder- and edge-constrained
scenarios via attention-free encoding and KD. Extensive simulations show that
NEFT achieves a 15--21 dB improvement in normalized mean-squared error (NMSE)
over state-of-the-art methods, while NEFT-Compact and NEFT-Edge reduce total
FLOPs by 25--36% with negligible accuracy loss. Moreover, NEFT-Hybrid lowers
encoder-side complexity by up to 64%, enabling deployment in highly asymmetric
device scenarios. These results establish NEFT as a practical and scalable
solution for near-field CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems.

*Giorgi Tsintsadze,Haran Manoharan,Aaron Harmon,Daniel Commerou,Connor Buneta,Brian Booth,Daryl Beetner*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对GPS接收器附近电子设备的EMC限制水平指南，并通过理论模型和实际噪声源验证了其对载噪比的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于GPS信号较弱，附近的电子设备可能产生电磁干扰，影响GPS接收器的性能。需要制定更精细的评估标准。

Method: 提出了一个理论模型预测射频干扰对载噪比的影响，并通过实际噪声源验证。

Result: 模型成功预测了载噪比的下降，并用于制定基于噪声频率、带宽和幅度的评估指南。

Conclusion: 新指南提供了比简单限制线更精细的评估方法，适用于GPS接收器附近的电子设备设计。

Abstract: Because GPS signals are weak, electronic systems and components that are
placed near GPS receivers can easily cause disruptive electromagnetic
interference through their unintended radiated emissions. In this paper, EMC
limit level guidelines are presented for electronics that are intended to be
placed near to GPS receivers, as often happens in automotive and other
applications. One of the challenges of defining limit-levels for systems
intended to be integrated with GPS receivers is that the impact of noise at the
input of the receiver may vary substantially depending on the form of the noise
due to the correlator function implemented by GPS receiver. The quality of the
correlated signal is typically represented using the carrier-to-noise ratio ($C
/ N_0$). A theoretical model predicting the degredation of the carrier-to-noise
ratio with radio frequency interference is presented in this paper and is
validated with realistic noise sources. The model is then used to develop
guidelines to assess the impact of unintended emissions from electronic devices
on nearby GPS receivers based on the frequency, bandwidth, and magnitude of the
noise. These guidelines provide a more nuanced method of evaluating emissions
than simple limit lines that are used by many emissions standards.

Conclusion: 该基准为DPS算法的研究提供了标准化工具，并鼓励研究者贡献结果以促进算法改进。

Abstract: We propose a statistical benchmark for diffusion posterior sampling (DPS)
algorithms for Bayesian linear inverse problems. The benchmark synthesizes
signals from sparse L\'evy-process priors whose posteriors admit efficient
Gibbs methods. These Gibbs methods can be used to obtain gold-standard
posterior samples that can be compared to the samples obtained by the DPS
algorithms. By using the Gibbs methods for the resolution of the denoising
problems in the reverse diffusion, the framework also isolates the error that
arises from the approximations to the likelihood score. We instantiate the
benchmark with the minimum-mean-squared-error optimality gap and posterior
coverage tests and provide numerical experiments for popular DPS algorithms on
the inverse problems of denoising, deconvolution, imputation, and
reconstruction from partial Fourier measurements. We release the benchmark code
at https://github.com/zacmar/dps-benchmark. The repository exposes simple
plug-in interfaces, reference scripts, and config-driven runs so that new
algorithms can be added and evaluated with minimal effort. We invite
researchers to contribute and report results.

Abstract: We propose a posterior sampling algorithm for the problem of estimating
multiple independent source signals from their noisy superposition. The
proposed algorithm is a combination of Gibbs sampling method and plug-and-play

for signal separation, our method allows source priors to be learned separately
and flexibly combined without retraining. Moreover, under the assumption of
perfect diffusion model training, the proposed method provably produces samples
from the posterior distribution. Experiments on the task of heartbeat
extraction from mixtures with synthetic motion artifacts demonstrate the
superior performance of our method over existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurate and personalized environment recognition is essential for seamless
indoor positioning and optimized connectivity, yet traditional fingerprinting
requires costly site surveys and lacks user-level adaptation. We present a
survey-free, on-device sensor-fusion framework that builds a personalized,
lightweight multi-source fingerprint (FP) database from pedestrian dead
reckoning (PDR), WiFi/cellular, GNSS, and interaction time tags. Matching is
performed by an AI-enhanced dynamic time warping module (AIDTW) that aligns
noisy, asynchronous sequences. To turn perception into continually improving
actions, a cloud-edge online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
loop aggregates desensitized summaries and human feedback in the cloud to
optimize a policy via proximal policy optimization (PPO), and periodically
distills updates to devices. Across indoor/outdoor scenarios, our system
reduces network-transition latency (measured by time-to-switch, TTS) by 32-65%
in daily environments compared with conventional baselines, without
site-specific pre-deployment.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis and theoretical foundation for
next-generation backscatter networks that move beyond communication and
integrate RF location sensing capabilities. An end-to-end system model for
wideband OFDM backscatter systems is derived, including detailed
characterization of propagation channels, receiver chain impairments, RF tag
operation, and unsynchronized network nodes. The theoretical system model is
validated through experimental evaluation using actual hardware, demonstrating
the detailed model's accuracy. A practical bistatic ranging method that can
operate with unsynchronized nodes is presented, along with the Cram\'er-Rao
Lower Bound (CRLB) derived to show the achievable performance limits. Our
experimental results demonstrate the system performance for communication, RF
sensing, and ranging, while also benchmarking against the derived theoretical
limits. This analytical framework and experimental validation establish
fundamental understanding of distributed, unsynchronized backscatter systems
for future machine-type communication networks that are deployed in massive
scale, while remaining energy-efficient.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的基于差分的恢复方法，克服了传统ADC在信号超过输入范围时的限制，理论证明和硬件实验均验证了其高效性和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ADC在信号超过输入范围时会失真，现有的模数采样方法虽能克服这一限制，但恢复方法计算量大或采样率要求高，且忽视了采样抖动的影响。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用基于差分的恢复方法，理论上证明了更高阶差分可以降低所需的过采样因子，并对噪声和非均匀采样（抖动）情况进行了扩展分析。

Result: 理论分析表明，高阶差分可将过采样因子从$2\pi e$降至$\pi$，实验证明了方法在幅度扩展高达$\rho = 108$时的可靠重构。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单且稳健的恢复流程，实现了高性能的无限制传感，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) clip when signals exceed
their input range. Modulo (unlimited) sampling overcomes this limitation by
folding the signal before digitization, but existing recovery methods are
either computationally intensive or constrained by loose oversampling bounds
that demand high sampling rates. In addition, none account for sampling jitter,
which is unavoidable in practice. This paper revisits difference-based recovery
and establishes new theoretical and practical guarantees. In the noiseless
setting, we prove that arbitrarily high difference order reduces the sufficient
oversampling factor from $2\pi e$ to $\pi$, substantially tightening classical
bounds. For fixed order $N$, we derive a noise-aware sampling condition that
guarantees stable recovery. For second-order difference-based recovery ($N=2$),
we further extend the analysis to non-uniform sampling, proving robustness
under bounded jitter. An FPGA-based hardware prototype demonstrates reliable
reconstruction with amplitude expansion up to $\rho = 108$, confirming the
feasibility of high-performance unlimited sensing with a simple and robust
recovery pipeline.

Abstract: Precision agriculture demands non-invasive, energy-efficient, and sustainable
plant monitoring solutions. In this work, we present the design and
implementation of a lightweight, batteryless plant movement sensor powered
solely by RF energy. This sensor targets Controlled Environment Agriculture

which correlates with plant physiological responses to environmental stress. By
eliminating the battery, we reduce the ecological footprint, weight, and
maintenance requirements, transitioning from lifetime-based to operation-based
energy storage. Our design minimizes circuit complexity while enabling
flexible, adaptive readout scheduling based on energy availability and sensor
data. We detail the energy requirements, RF power transfer considerations,

Conclusion: 提出的深度张量学习方法能够有效应对真实世界中信道的噪声和不完整性，提升了信道图的性能。

Abstract: Channel charting has emerged as a powerful tool for user equipment
localization and wireless environment sensing. Its efficacy lies in mapping
high-dimensional channel data into low-dimensional features that preserve the
relative similarities of the original data. However, existing channel charting
methods are largely developed using simulated or indoor measurements, often
assuming clean and complete channel data across all frequency bands. In
contrast, real-world channels collected from base stations are typically
incomplete due to frequency hopping and are significantly noisy, particularly
at cell edges. These challenging conditions greatly degrade the performance of
current methods. To address this, we propose a deep tensor learning method that
leverages the inherent tensor structure of wireless channels to effectively
extract informative while low-dimensional features (i.e., channel charts) from
noisy and incomplete measurements. Experimental results demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of the proposed approach in these challenging
scenarios.

Result: 通过复杂室内办公室的测量校准射线追踪验证，GM-SAGE能有效处理多反射信道。

Conclusion: GM-SAGE方法为多反射信道建模和参数估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Indoor sensing is challenging because of the multi-bounce effect, spherical
wavefront, and spatial nonstationarity (SNS) of the near-field effect. This
paper addresses radio-based environment sensing considering these issues.
Specifically, graph theory (GT) is used to model the multi-bounce propagation
of the near field. In this manner, indoor reflectors/scatterers are modeled as
vertices in a propagation graph, the multi-bounce paths are modeled by the
edges linking the vertices. Besides, the coupled multipath parameters in the
near field, i.e., range and angles, are denoted directly by the coordinates of
vertices. Then, the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization
(SAGE) algorithm is adapted to the proposed Graph theory-based dictionary-aided
Multi-bounce SAGE (GM-SAGE), where the searching parameters including range and
angle of departure/arrival (AoD/AoA) are transformed to the coordinates of
scatterers in the graph. The proposed algorithm is validated through
measurement-calibrated ray tracing (RT) in a complex indoor office. The results
demonstrate that the proposed GM-SAGE can deal with multi-bounce channels.

Abstract: We address target detection in a single Delay-Doppler cell using spatially
distributed two-channel passive radars. An unknown illuminator of opportunity
(IO) is assumed to emit a waveform lying in a known low-dimensional subspace
(e.g., OFDM). Each receiver transforms its reference and surveillance signals
onto the IO subspace after noise-whitening, to obtain cross-correlation (CC)
measurements. To save bandwidth, receivers collaboratively exchange and
linearly combine the CC output, and only a subset transmits them to a fusion
center (FC) over a multiple-access channel (MAC). Collaboration weights are
designed using the moments of the FC measurement to enhance detection
performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为几何红队测试（GRT）的框架，用于通过对象中心几何扰动自动触发预训练机器人操作策略的失败，揭示了静态基准未检测到的脆弱性。通过蓝队调优，策略性能可显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器人操作评估协议仅限于静态测试集，无法揭示策略在实际几何变化下的鲁棒性失败模式。

Method: GRT结合基于雅可比场的变形模型和梯度无优化策略，自动生成合法变形（CrashShapes），并通过仿真循环验证策略性能崩溃。

Result: GRT成功发现导致策略性能显著下降的变形，蓝队调优将任务成功率提升高达60%，并在真实机器人上验证了仿真结果。

Conclusion: GRT是一种通用框架，可通过几何红队测试识别策略脆弱性，并结合蓝队调优针对性提升鲁棒性，仿真与真实实验结果一致。

Abstract: Standard evaluation protocols in robotic manipulation typically assess policy
performance over curated, in-distribution test sets, offering limited insight
into how systems fail under plausible variation. We introduce Geometric
Red-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through
object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes --
structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger
catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method
integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free,
simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation,
and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse
policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static
benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape
exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured,
object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally
show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as
blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those
shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the
utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we
validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm,
observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as
22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the
corresponding real-world geometry -- closely matching simulation outcomes.

Conclusion: 事件触发式控制器在资源受限的多智能体系统中具有高效性和稳定性，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of collaborative formation control for
multi-agent systems with limited resources. We consider a team of robots tasked
with achieving a desired formation from arbitrary initial configurations. To
reduce unnecessary control updates and conserve resources, we propose a
distributed event-triggered formation controller that relies on inter-agent
distance measurements. Control updates are triggered only when the measurement
error exceeds a predefined threshold, ensuring system stability. The proposed
controller is validated through extensive simulations and real-world
experiments involving different formations, communication topologies,
scalability tests, and variations in design parameters, while also being
compared against periodic triggering strategies. Results demonstrate that the
event-triggered approach significantly reduces control efforts while preserving
formation performance.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三链接运动链和人行走数据中均能提供无漂移的方向估计和快速收敛的关节位置。

Conclusion: 该方法无需校准，轻量且高效，适用于实时运动捕捉。

Abstract: Inertial motion capture is a promising approach for capturing motion outside
the laboratory. However, as one major drawback, most of the current methods
require different quantities to be calibrated or computed offline as part of
the setup process, such as segment lengths, relative orientations between
inertial measurement units (IMUs) and segment coordinate frames (IMU-to-segment
calibrations) or the joint positions in the IMU frames. This renders the setup
process inconvenient. This work contributes to real-time capable
calibration-free inertial tracking of a kinematic chain, i.e. simultaneous
recursive Bayesian estimation of global IMU angular kinematics and joint
positions in the IMU frames, with a minimal state size. Experimental results on
simulated IMU data from a three-link kinematic chain (manipulator study) as
well as re-simulated IMU data from healthy humans walking (lower body study)
show that the calibration-free and lightweight algorithm provides not only
drift-free relative but also drift-free absolute orientation estimates with a
global heading reference for only one IMU as well as robust and fast
convergence of joint position estimates in the different movement scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了仅用运动学输入（腱长）即可实现静态条件下的开环控制，简化了超冗余系统的实际应用问题。

Abstract: Hyper-redundant tendon-driven manipulators offer greater flexibility and
compliance over traditional manipulators. A common way of controlling such
manipulators relies on adjusting tendon lengths, which is an accessible control
parameter. This approach works well when the kinematic configuration is
representative of the real operational conditions. However, when dealing with
manipulators of larger size subject to gravity, it becomes necessary to solve a
static force problem, using tendon force as the input and employing a mapping
from the configuration space to retrieve tendon length. Alternatively,
measurements of the manipulator posture can be used to iteratively adjust
tendon lengths to achieve a desired posture. Hence, either tension measurement
or state estimation of the manipulator are required, both of which are not
always accurately available. Here, we propose a solution by reconciling cables
tension and length as the input for the solution of the system forward statics.
We develop a screw-based formulation for a tendon-driven, multi-segment,
hyper-redundant manipulator with elastic joints and introduce a forward statics
iterative solution method that equivalently makes use of either tendon length
or tension as the input. This strategy is experimentally validated using a
traditional tension input first, subsequently showing the efficacy of the
method when exclusively tendon lengths are used. The results confirm the
possibility to perform open-loop control in static conditions using a kinematic
input only, thus bypassing some of the practical problems with tension
measurement and state estimation of hyper-redundant systems.

Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for
navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in
payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like
high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,
high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100
grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates
a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A
near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate
an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model
quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently
capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data
acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline
employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)
approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)
location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this
architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both
single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory
adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight
paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks
the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in
constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger
platforms.

Abstract: Deformable substrates such as sand and mud present significant challenges for
terrestrial robots due to complex robot-terrain interactions. Inspired by
mudskippers, amphibious animals that naturally adjust their tail morphology and
movement jointly to navigate such environments, we investigate how tail design
and control can jointly enhance flipper-driven locomotion on granular media.
Using a bio-inspired robot modeled after the mudskipper, we experimentally
compared locomotion performance between idle and actively oscillating tail
configurations. Tail oscillation increased robot speed by 67% and reduced body
drag by 46%. Shear force measurements revealed that this improvement was
enabled by tail oscillation fluidizing the substrate, thereby reducing
resistance. Additionally, tail morphology strongly influenced the oscillation
strategy: designs with larger horizontal surface areas leveraged the
oscillation-reduced shear resistance more effectively by limiting insertion
depth. Based on these findings, we present a design principle to inform tail
action selection based on substrate strength and tail morphology. Our results
offer new insights into tail design and control for improving robot locomotion
on deformable substrates, with implications for agricultural robotics, search
and rescue, and environmental exploration.

Abstract: One of the main goals of robotics and intelligent agent research is to enable
natural communication with humans in physically situated settings. While recent
work has focused on verbal modes such as language and speech, non-verbal
communication is crucial for flexible interaction. We present a framework for
generating pointing gestures in embodied agents by combining imitation and
reinforcement learning. Using a small motion capture dataset, our method learns
a motor control policy that produces physically valid, naturalistic gestures
with high referential accuracy. We evaluate the approach against supervised
learning and retrieval baselines in both objective metrics and a virtual
reality referential game with human users. Results show that our system
achieves higher naturalness and accuracy than state-of-the-art supervised
models, highlighting the promise of imitation-RL for communicative gesture
generation and its potential application to robots.

Abstract: Autonomous robots must go from zero prior knowledge to safe control within
seconds to operate in unstructured environments. Abrupt terrain changes, such
as a sudden transition to ice, create dynamics shifts that can destabilize
planners unless the model adapts in real-time. We present a method for online
adaptation that combines function encoders with recursive least squares,
treating the function encoder coefficients as latent states updated from
streaming odometry. This yields constant-time coefficient estimation without
gradient-based inner-loop updates, enabling adaptation from only a few seconds
of data. We evaluate our approach on a Van der Pol system to highlight
algorithmic behavior, in a Unity simulator for high-fidelity off-road
navigation, and on a Clearpath Jackal robot, including on a challenging terrain
at a local ice rink. Across these settings, our method improves model accuracy
and downstream planning, reducing collisions compared to static and

Result: PVMs在极端偏移下表现优于基线模型，部分微调能保持最高任务性能。

Conclusion: PVMs能有效提升视觉策略学习的鲁棒性，值得在MBRL中广泛应用。

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is
derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and
vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel
visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy
network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent
developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is
more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has
found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness
in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show
that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline
model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying
levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can
maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in
promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence
for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.

TL;DR: KORR是一个基于Koopman算子的残差策略框架，通过全局动力学建模改进模仿学习，显著提升了长期任务和高精度控制的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习在长期任务和高精度控制中容易因误差累积而受限，现有残差学习方法缺乏对全局状态演化的理解，限制了其鲁棒性和泛化性。

Method: 利用Koopman算子理论在潜在空间中学习线性时不变结构，结合残差策略修正，形成KORR框架，实现全局引导的动作优化。

Result: 实验表明，KORR在长期精细化机器人组装任务中表现优于基线方法，具备更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: KORR框架展示了Koopman理论在现代学习方法中的潜力，为经典控制理论与学习方法的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from
demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision
control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising,
model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop
corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections
to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which
limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we
propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy
updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear
time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state
transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen
environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a
simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on
Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action
refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture
assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent
gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our
findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge
modern learning methods with classical control theory.

TL;DR: LightVLA是一种高效的可微分视觉token裁剪框架，通过动态评估token重要性并利用Gumbel softmax实现裁剪，显著降低计算开销同时提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在资源受限平台上部署时的计算瓶颈问题，提出了一种无需额外参数的自适应token裁剪方法。

Method: 利用动态查询评估视觉token重要性，结合Gumbel softmax实现可微分裁剪，通过微调保留关键token。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，LightVLA降低FLOPs和延迟59.1%和38.2%，任务成功率提升2.9%。

Conclusion: LightVLA首次在VLA任务中实现了效率与性能的双重优化，为实时机器人系统的实用化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning
framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown
impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment
on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy
attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA
addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual
tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and
adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through
fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens
while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby
improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires
no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,
making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results
demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token
pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher
success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,
LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%
improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable
query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable
parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that
as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune
tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks
with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant
step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActiveVLN提出了一种通过多轮强化学习（RL）实现主动探索的VLN框架，显著提升了性能并降低了数据收集和训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模仿学习（IL）的VLN方法数据成本高，而现有RL方法缺乏动态交互和主动探索能力，限制了导航路径的多样性。

Method: 分两阶段：先用少量专家轨迹进行IL，再通过多轮RL主动收集多样轨迹并优化。采用GRPO目标和动态提前停止策略。

Result: ActiveVLN在性能提升上优于IL和现有RL方法，且模型更小。

Conclusion: ActiveVLN为VLN任务提供了一种高效的主动探索解决方案。

Abstract: The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow
natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments.
Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and
often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While
effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training
costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However,
prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend
on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended
active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and
plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose
ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through
multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is
used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively
predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and
optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL
efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail
or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.
Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL
baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training
methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art
approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

Motivation: 解决现有设计中因额外吸附设备导致的复杂性增加、效率降低和可靠性不足的问题。

Method: 采用四风扇设计，同时提供空中推力和负压吸附，并配备四个驱动轮，开发建模与控制框架以协调多模式运动。

Result: 实验验证了其在多种运动模式（地面行驶、墙面攀爬、空中飞行及模式转换）中的适应性。

Conclusion: PerchMobi³ 为多模态机器人移动性提供了新范本，为未来自主和应用导向的部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Achieving seamless integration of aerial flight, ground driving, and wall
climbing within a single robotic platform remains a major challenge, as
existing designs often rely on additional adhesion actuators that increase
complexity, reduce efficiency, and compromise reliability. To address these
limitations, we present PerchMobi^3, a quad-fan, negative-pressure,
air-ground-wall robot that implements a propulsion-adhesion power-reuse
mechanism. By repurposing four ducted fans to simultaneously provide aerial
thrust and negative-pressure adhesion, and integrating them with four actively
driven wheels, PerchMobi^3 eliminates dedicated pumps while maintaining a
lightweight and compact design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
quad-fan prototype to demonstrate functional power reuse for multi-modal
locomotion. A modeling and control framework enables coordinated operation
across ground, wall, and aerial domains with fan-assisted transitions. The
feasibility of the design is validated through a comprehensive set of
experiments covering ground driving, payload-assisted wall climbing, aerial
flight, and cross-mode transitions, demonstrating robust adaptability across
locomotion scenarios. These results highlight the potential of PerchMobi^3 as a
novel design paradigm for multi-modal robotic mobility, paving the way for
future extensions toward autonomous and application-oriented deployment.

Conclusion: 基于物理的稀疏安全评估是一种可扩展的策略，适合在不确定性下实现安全的机器人操作。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in dynamic and unstructured environments requires safety
mechanisms that exploit what is known and what is uncertain about the world.
Existing safety filters often assume full observability, limiting their
applicability in real-world tasks. We propose a physics-based safety filtering
scheme that leverages high-fidelity simulation to assess control policies under
uncertainty in world parameters. The method combines dense rollout with nominal
parameters and parallelizable sparse re-evaluation at critical
state-transitions, quantified through generalized factors of safety for stable
grasping and actuator limits, and targeted uncertainty reduction through
probing actions. We demonstrate the approach in a simulated bimanual
manipulation task with uncertain object mass and friction, showing that unsafe
trajectories can be identified and filtered efficiently. Our results highlight
physics-based sparse safety evaluation as a scalable strategy for safe robotic
manipulation under uncertainty.

Motivation: 解决多机器人建图中通信挑战（如丢包和带宽限制）导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出UDON框架，采用不确定性加权分布式优化，优先处理可靠地图部分并惩罚通信代理间的建图分歧。

Result: 在标准数据集和实际硬件上验证，UDON在极低通信成功率（如1%）下显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: UDON在严重通信退化条件下仍能保持高保真建图和一致的场景表示。

Abstract: Multi-robot mapping with neural implicit representations enables the compact
reconstruction of complex environments. However, it demands robustness against
communication challenges like packet loss and limited bandwidth. While prior
works have introduced various mechanisms to mitigate communication disruptions,
performance degradation still occurs under extremely low communication success
rates. This paper presents UDON, a real-time multi-agent neural implicit
mapping framework that introduces a novel uncertainty-weighted distributed
optimization to achieve high-quality mapping under severe communication
deterioration. The uncertainty weighting prioritizes more reliable portions of
the map, while the distributed optimization isolates and penalizes mapping
disagreement between individual pairs of communicating agents. We conduct
extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world robot
hardware. We demonstrate that UDON significantly outperforms existing
baselines, maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions and consistent scene
representations even under extreme communication degradation (as low as 1%
success rate).

Result: 实验展示高精度力/扭矩测量（R² > 0.98）、灵敏度可调及支持视觉分类任务。

Conclusion: MoiréTac在机器人灵巧操作中表现出潜力，验证了其多功能性和实用性。

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors typically employ sparse marker arrays that limit spatial
resolution and lack clear analytical force-to-image relationships. To solve
this problem, we present \textbf{Moir\'eTac}, a dual-mode sensor that generates
dense interference patterns via overlapping micro-gratings within a transparent
architecture. When two gratings overlap with misalignment, they create moir\'e
patterns that amplify microscopic deformations. The design preserves optical
clarity for vision tasks while producing continuous moir\'e fields for tactile
sensing, enabling simultaneous 6-axis force/torque measurement, contact
localization, and visual perception. We combine physics-based features
(brightness, phase gradient, orientation, and period) from moir\'e patterns
with deep spatial features. These are mapped to 6-axis force/torque
measurements, enabling interpretable regression through end-to-end learning.
Experimental results demonstrate three capabilities: force/torque measurement
with R^2 > 0.98 across tested axes; sensitivity tuning through geometric
parameters (threefold gain adjustment); and vision functionality for object
classification despite moir\'e overlay. Finally, we integrate the sensor into a
robotic arm for cap removal with coordinated force and torque control,
validating its potential for dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Navigation among movable obstacles (NAMO) is a critical task in robotics,
often challenged by real-world uncertainties such as observation noise, model
approximations, action failures, and partial observability. Existing solutions
frequently assume ideal conditions, leading to suboptimal or risky decisions.
This paper introduces NAMOUnc, a novel framework designed to address these
uncertainties by integrating them into the decision-making process. We first
estimate them and compare the corresponding time cost intervals for removing
and bypassing obstacles, optimizing both the success rate and time efficiency,
ensuring safer and more efficient navigation. We validate our method through
extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating significant
improvements over existing NAMO frameworks. More details can be found in our

Abstract: Robots are unrelentingly used to achieve operational efficiency in Industry
4.0 along with symbiotic and sustainable assistance for the work-force in
Industry 5.0. As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in
anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous
anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors
overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots
are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user
experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in
advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their
lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown,
when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories
and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement
after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with
generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage
thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal
difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational
autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the
thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from
emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.

Conclusion: 该系统显著提升了任务完成率和用户体验。

Abstract: Robot-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly improve the lives
of individuals with mobility impairments. To ensure an effective and
comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging
deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements
throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions
-- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world
applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system
capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as
robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy
trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to
fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal
feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's
adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in
simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human
study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully
dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being
adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior
baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback. Video are available at

Conclusion: NAVMOE通过动态加权和专业模型结合，在可穿行性估计中实现了高效、适应性强且高质量的导航解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores traversability estimation for robot navigation. A key
bottleneck in traversability estimation lies in efficiently achieving reliable
and robust predictions while accurately encoding both geometric and semantic
information across diverse environments. We introduce Navigation via Mixture of
Experts (NAVMOE), a hierarchical and modular approach for traversability
estimation and local navigation. NAVMOE combines multiple specialized models
for specific terrain types, each of which can be either a classical model-based
or a learning-based approach that predicts traversability for specific terrain
types. NAVMOE dynamically weights the contributions of different models based
on the input environment through a gating network. Overall, our approach offers
three advantages: First, NAVMOE enables traversability estimation to adaptively
leverage specialized approaches for different terrains, which enhances
generalization across diverse and unseen environments. Second, our approach
significantly improves efficiency with negligible cost of solution quality by
introducing a training-free lazy gating mechanism, which is designed to
minimize the number of activated experts during inference. Third, our approach
uses a two-stage training strategy that enables the training for the gating
networks within the hybrid MoE method that contains nondifferentiable modules.
Extensive experiments show that NAVMOE delivers a better efficiency and
performance balance than any individual expert or full ensemble across
different domains, improving cross- domain generalization and reducing average
computational cost by 81.2% via lazy gating, with less than a 2% loss in path
quality.

Conclusion: 结合主动推断和LLM引导的常识推理，能有效提升机器人获取所有权知识的能力，使其更实用且符合社交规范。

Abstract: Robots operating in domestic and office environments must understand object
ownership to correctly execute instructions such as ``Bring me my cup.''
However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To
address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework
that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to
users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that
maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to
improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge
from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared
or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through
experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory
setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy
with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the
effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense
reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge
for practical and socially appropriate task execution.

Abstract: Jumping constitutes an essential component of quadruped robots' locomotion
capabilities, which includes dynamic take-off and adaptive landing. Existing
quadrupedal jumping studies mainly focused on the stance and flight phase by
assuming a flat landing ground, which is impractical in many real world cases.
This work proposes a safe landing framework that achieves adaptive landing on
rough terrains by combining Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement
Learning (RL) together. The RL agent learns to track the reference motion
generated by TO in the environments with rough terrains. To enable the learning
of compliant landing skills on challenging terrains, a reward relaxation
strategy is synthesized to encourage exploration during landing recovery
period. Extensive experiments validate the accurate tracking and safe landing
skills benefiting from our proposed method in various scenarios.

Conclusion: S-MSP在工厂物流场景中展示了实用性，兼顾逻辑正确性和物理可行性。

Abstract: We investigate the task and motion planning problem for Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) specifications in robotics. Existing STL methods rely on pre-defined maps
or mobility representations, which are ineffective in unstructured real-world
environments. We propose the \emph{Structured-MoE STL Planner}
(\textbf{S-MSP}), a differentiable framework that maps synchronized multi-view
camera observations and an STL specification directly to a feasible trajectory.
S-MSP integrates STL constraints within a unified pipeline, trained with a
composite loss that combines trajectory reconstruction and STL robustness. A
\emph{structure-aware} Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model enables horizon-aware
specialization by projecting sub-tasks into temporally anchored embeddings. We
evaluate S-MSP using a high-fidelity simulation of factory-logistics scenarios
with temporally constrained tasks. Experiments show that S-MSP outperforms
single-expert baselines in STL satisfaction and trajectory feasibility. A
rule-based \emph{safety filter} at inference improves physical executability
without compromising logical correctness, showcasing the practicality of the
approach.

Abstract: It is crucial to efficiently execute instructions such as "Find an apple and
a banana" or "Get ready for a field trip," which require searching for multiple
objects or understanding context-dependent commands. This study addresses the
challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part
of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site
knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it
by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions
into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel
few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from
ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our
experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments,
outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50).
Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile
manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle
instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as "Get ready
for a field trip," by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment,
sequential planning, and execution.

Abstract: Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and
autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To
bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal
displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most
existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more
specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise
spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused
by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and
extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of
discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time
state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the
increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial
platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one
minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total.
To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be
open-source.

*Antoine Lénat,Olivier Cheminat,Damien Chablat,Camilo Charron*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了人机交互在工业中的重要性，特别是在Industry 5.0时代下，强调了操作员技能的适应性与建模需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Industry 5.0的兴起，人机交互变得愈发重要。操作员在使用机器时需要调整其技能以达到最佳效果，因此亟需对这些技能进行建模和理解。

Method: 论文提出结合Vergnaud的谓词逻辑（基于Piaget的方案概念）与认知架构模型，以解决认知系统约束（如时间限制、认知资源分配等）未被原理论涵盖的问题。并以焊接为例，分析了操作员技能适应的挑战。

Result: 研究发现，焊接操作员需要动态调整技能以应对可变参数，但由于焊接质量只能事后评估，这种延迟反馈和不可逆错误的特点突出了技能建模的重要性。

Conclusion: 论文指出，结合谓词逻辑与认知架构模型可以更全面地描述操作员技能，并为人机交互中的技能转移提供理论基础，特别是在焊接等复杂工业场景中。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction is increasingly important in industry, and this
trend will only intensify with the rise of Industry 5.0. Human operators have
skills that need to be adapted when using machines to achieve the best results.
It is crucial to highlight the operator's skills and understand how they use
and adapt them [18]. A rigorous description of these skills is necessary to
compare performance with and without robot assistance. Predicate logic, used by
Vergnaud within Piaget's scheme concept, offers a promising approach. However,
this theory doesn't account for cognitive system constraints, such as the
timing of actions, the limitation of cognitive resources, the parallelization
of tasks, or the activation of automatic gestures contrary to optimal
knowledge. Integrating these constraints is essential for representing agent
skills understanding skill transfer between biological and mechanical
structures. Cognitive architectures models [2] address these needs by
describing cognitive structure and can be combined with the scheme for mutual
benefit. Welding provides a relevant case study, as it highlights the
challenges faced by operators, even highly skilled ones. Welding's complexity
stems from the need for constant skill adaptation to variable parameters like
part position and process. This adaptation is crucial, as weld quality, a key
factor, is only assessed afterward via destructive testing. Thus, the welder is
confronted with a complex perception-decision-action cycle, where the
evaluation of the impact of his actions is delayed and where errors are
definitive. This dynamic underscores the importance of understanding and
modeling the skills of operators.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has produced remarkable advances in humanoid
locomotion, yet a fundamental dilemma persists for real-world deployment:
policies must choose between the robustness of reactive proprioceptive control
or the proactivity of complex, fragile perception-driven systems. This paper
resolves this dilemma by introducing a paradigm that imbues a purely
proprioceptive policy with proactive capabilities, achieving the foresight of
perception without its deployment-time costs. Our core contribution is a
contrastive learning framework that compels the actor's latent state to encode
privileged environmental information from simulation. Crucially, this
``distilled awareness" empowers an adaptive gait clock, allowing the policy to
proactively adjust its rhythm based on an inferred understanding of the
terrain. This synergy resolves the classic trade-off between rigid, clocked
gaits and unstable clock-free policies. We validate our approach with zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer to a full-sized humanoid, demonstrating highly robust
locomotion over challenging terrains, including 30 cm high steps and 26.5{\deg}
slopes, proving the effectiveness of our method. Website:

Result: 实验表明，GRATE在距离和时间效率上分别提升21.5%和21.3%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GRATE方法显著提高了机器人探索效率，并在仿真和实际场景中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Autonomous robot exploration (ARE) is the process of a robot autonomously
navigating and mapping an unknown environment. Recent Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making
problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods
often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data.
Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting
RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while
neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph
Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global
contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's
reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a
Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path
is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5%
in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art
conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We
also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的度量方法有效，适用于评估社会机器人导航中的冲突解决行为，并讨论了其应用和局限性。

Abstract: In Social Robot Navigation (SRN), the availability of meaningful metrics is
crucial for evaluating trajectories from human-robot interactions. In the SRN
context, such interactions often relate to resolving conflicts between two or
more agents. Correspondingly, the shares to which agents contribute to the
resolution of such conflicts are important. This paper builds on recent work,
which proposed a Responsibility metric capturing such shares. We extend this
framework in two directions: First, we model the conflict buildup phase by
introducing a time normalization. Second, we propose the related Engagement
metric, which captures how the agents' actions intensify a conflict. In a
comprehensive series of simulated scenarios with dyadic, group and crowd
interactions, we show that the metrics carry meaningful information about the
cooperative resolution of conflicts in interactions. They can be used to assess
behavior quality and foresightedness. We extensively discuss applicability,
design choices and limitations of the proposed metrics.

Result: 新指标能够量化冲突减少的程度及责任归属，有助于提升人机交互的质量。

Conclusion: 该研究为SRN算法的标准化评估提供了新工具，有望增强机器人在人类环境中的安全性和社会接受度。

Abstract: Establishing standardized metrics for Social Robot Navigation (SRN)
algorithms for assessing the quality and social compliance of robot behavior
around humans is essential for SRN research. Currently, commonly used
evaluation metrics lack the ability to quantify how cooperative an agent
behaves in interaction with humans. Concretely, in a simple frontal approach
scenario, no metric specifically captures if both agents cooperate or if one
agent stays on collision course and the other agent is forced to evade. To
address this limitation, we propose two new metrics, a conflict intensity
metric and the responsibility metric. Together, these metrics are capable of
evaluating the quality of human-robot interactions by showing how much a given
algorithm has contributed to reducing a conflict and which agent actually took
responsibility of the resolution. This work aims to contribute to the
development of a comprehensive and standardized evaluation methodology for SRN,
ultimately enhancing the safety, efficiency, and social acceptance of robots in
human-centric environments.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在曲线焊缝扫描中的可行性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了时空同步问题，并开源了相关资源。

Abstract: Laser vision sensors (LVS) are critical perception modules for industrial
robots, facilitating real-time acquisition of workpiece geometric data in
welding applications. However, the camera communication delay will lead to a
temporal desynchronization between captured images and the robot motions.
Additionally, hand-eye extrinsic parameters may vary during prolonged
measurement. To address these issues, we introduce a measurement model of LVS
considering the effect of the camera's time-offset and propose a teaching-free
spatiotemporal calibration method utilizing line constraints. This method
involves a robot equipped with an LVS repeatedly scanning straight-line fillet
welds using S-shaped trajectories. Regardless of the robot's orientation
changes, all measured welding positions are constrained to a straight-line,
represented by Plucker coordinates. Moreover, a nonlinear optimization model
based on straight-line constraints is established. Subsequently, the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) is employed to optimize parameters,
including time-offset, hand-eye extrinsic parameters, and straight-line
parameters. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach are
quantitatively validated through experiments on curved weld scanning. We
open-sourced the code, dataset, and simulation report at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LVS_ST_CALIB-015F/README.md.

Abstract: Anthropomorphic underactuated hands are widely employed for their versatility
and structural simplicity. In such systems, compact sensing integration and
proper interpretation aligned with underactuation are crucial for realizing
practical grasp functionalities. This study proposes an anthropomorphic
underactuated hand that achieves comprehensive situational awareness of
hand-object interaction, utilizing tendon-based proprioception provided by
series elastic actuators (SEAs). We developed a compact SEA with high accuracy
and reliability that can be seamlessly integrated into sensorless fingers. By
coupling proprioceptive sensing with potential energy-based modeling, the
system estimates key grasp-related variables, including contact timing, joint
angles, relative object stiffness, and finger configuration changes indicating
external disturbances. These estimated variables enable grasp posture
reconstruction, safe handling of deformable objects, and blind grasping with
proprioceptive-only recognition of objects with varying geometry and stiffness.
Finger-level experiments and hand-level demonstrations confirmed the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that
tendon-based proprioception serves as a compact and robust sensing modality for
practical manipulation without reliance on vision or tactile feedback.

Motivation: 为了解决自适应机器人在复杂环境中主动检测和应对异常行为（包括OOD案例）的需求，提出利用数字孪生技术进行OOD检测。

Method: ODiSAR采用基于Transformer的数字孪生预测机器人状态，并通过重构误差和蒙特卡洛Dropout量化不确定性，结合预测方差检测OOD行为。

Result: 实验表明，ODiSAR在两种工业机器人场景下表现优异，检测性能高达98% AUROC、96% TNR@TPR95和95% F1-score。

Conclusion: ODiSAR不仅能高效检测OOD行为，还提供可解释的见解以支持自适应决策，为复杂环境中的机器人应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Self-adaptive robots (SARs) in complex, uncertain environments must
proactively detect and address abnormal behaviors, including
out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. To this end, digital twins offer a valuable
solution for OOD detection. Thus, we present a digital twin-based approach for
OOD detection (ODiSAR) in SARs. ODiSAR uses a Transformer-based digital twin to
forecast SAR states and employs reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout
for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with
predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even
in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an
explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering
insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of
two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another
performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR
behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects
OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance
-- up to 98\% AUROC, 96\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\% F1-score -- while providing
interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.

Abstract: Automatic docking has long been a significant challenge in the field of
mobile robotics. Compared to other automatic docking methods, visual docking
methods offer higher precision and lower deployment costs, making them an
efficient and promising choice for this task. However, visual docking methods
impose strict requirements on the robot's initial position at the start of the
docking process. To overcome the limitations of current vision-based methods,
we propose an innovative end-to-end visual docking method named DVDP(direct
visual docking policy). This approach requires only a binocular RGB-D camera
installed on the mobile robot to directly output the robot's docking path,
achieving end-to-end automatic docking. Furthermore, we have collected a
large-scale dataset of mobile robot visual automatic docking dataset through a
combination of virtual and real environments using the Unity 3D platform and
actual mobile robot setups. We developed a series of evaluation metrics to
quantify the performance of the end-to-end visual docking method. Extensive
experiments, including benchmarks against leading perception backbones adapted
into our framework, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.
Finally, real-world deployment on the SCOUT Mini confirmed DVDP's efficacy,
with our model generating smooth, feasible docking trajectories that meet
physical constraints and reach the target pose.

Abstract: Persistent monitoring using robot teams is of interest in fields such as
security, environmental monitoring, and disaster recovery. Performing such
monitoring in a fully on-line decentralised fashion has significant potential
advantages for robustness, adaptability, and scalability of monitoring
solutions, including, in principle, the capacity to effectively adapt in
real-time to a changing environment. We examine this through the lens of
multi-robot patrol, in which teams of patrol robots must persistently minimise
time between visits to points of interest, within environments where
traversability of routes is highly dynamic. These dynamics must be observed by
patrol agents and accounted for in a fully decentralised on-line manner. In
this work, we present a new method of monitoring and adjusting for environment
dynamics in a decentralised multi-robot patrol team. We demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms realistic baselines in highly dynamic
scenarios, and also investigate dynamic scenarios in which explicitly
accounting for environment dynamics may be unnecessary or impractical.

Conclusion: SABD手的设计在保持灵巧性的同时，显著提升了抓取的稳定性和灵活性，适用于广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper presents the SABD hand, a 16-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic hand
that departs from purely anthropomorphic designs to achieve an expanded grasp
envelope, enable manipulation poses beyond human capability, and reduce the
required number of actuators. This is achieved by combining the
adduction/abduction (Add/Abd) joint of digits four and five into a single joint
with a large range of motion. The combined joint increases the workspace of the
digits by 400\% and reduces the required DoFs while retaining dexterity.
Experimental results demonstrate that the combined Add/Abd joint enables the
hand to grasp objects with a side distance of up to 200 mm. Reinforcement
learning-based investigations show that the design enables grasping policies
that are effective not only for handling larger objects but also for achieving
enhanced grasp stability. In teleoperated trials, the hand successfully
performed 86\% of attempted grasps on suitable YCB objects, including
challenging non-anthropomorphic configurations. These findings validate the
design's ability to enhance grasp stability, flexibility, and dexterous
manipulation without added complexity, making it well-suited for a wide range
of applications.

Abstract: Although robotic manipulators are used in an ever-growing range of
applications, robot manufacturers typically follow a ``one-fits-all''
philosophy, employing identical manipulators in various settings. This often
leads to suboptimal performance, as general-purpose designs fail to exploit
particularities of tasks. The development of custom, task-tailored robots is
hindered by long, cost-intensive development cycles and the high cost of
customized hardware. Recently, various computational design methods have been
devised to overcome the bottleneck of human engineering. In addition, a surge
of modular robots allows quick and economical adaptation to changing industrial
settings. This work proposes an approach to automatically designing and
optimizing robot morphologies tailored to a specific environment. To this end,
we learn the inverse kinematics for a wide range of different manipulators. A
fully differentiable framework realizes gradient-based fine-tuning of designed
robots and inverse kinematics solutions. Our generative approach accelerates
the generation of specialized designs from hours with optimization-based
methods to seconds, serving as a design co-pilot that enables instant
adaptation and effective human-AI collaboration. Numerical experiments show
that our approach finds robots that can navigate cluttered environments,
manipulators that perform well across a specified workspace, and can be adapted
to different hardware constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world
applicability of our method by setting up a modular robot designed in
simulation that successfully moves through an obstacle course.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in
robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However,
extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the
complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World
Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into
model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent,
sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint
dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential
communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its
actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables
explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces
communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated
environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing
state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall
performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative
behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM
has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems. Demos and code are available

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习的软体机器人控制系统，用于调制颅内压波形，以研究脑脊液动力学和神经疾病的病理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究脑脊液动力学和神经疾病的病理过程需要精确调制颅内压波形，但现有方法在安全性和非线性依赖性处理上存在不足。

Method: 采用两层框架：1) 使用带扰动观测器的模型预测控制器(MPC)实现安全约束下的电机位置轨迹跟踪；2) 利用贝叶斯优化(BO)算法在线学习能生成目标ICP波形的电机位置轨迹。

Result: 实验验证显示，MPC将电机位置跟踪误差的平均值和最大值分别降低83%和73%；BO算法在20次迭代内成功学习到目标ICP波形。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了软体机器人控制中的安全性和非线性问题，为神经科学研究提供了新的工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces a learning-based control framework for a soft robotic
actuator system designed to modulate intracranial pressure (ICP) waveforms,
which is essential for studying cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and pathological
processes underlying neurological disorders. A two-layer framework is proposed
to safely achieve a desired ICP waveform modulation. First, a model predictive
controller (MPC) with a disturbance observer is used for offset-free tracking
of the system's motor position reference trajectory under safety constraints.
Second, to address the unknown nonlinear dependence of ICP on the motor
position, we employ a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm used for online
learning of a motor position reference trajectory that yields the desired ICP
modulation. The framework is experimentally validated using a test bench with a
brain phantom that replicates realistic ICP dynamics in vitro. Compared to a
previously employed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the MPC
reduces mean and maximum motor position reference tracking errors by 83 % and
73 %, respectively. In less than 20 iterations, the BO algorithm learns a motor
position reference trajectory that yields an ICP waveform with the desired mean
and amplitude.

Motivation: 触觉传感器的固有柔顺性是其力反馈的关键，但其复杂的非线性动力学行为尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过扩展物体状态空间，显式纳入柔顺传感器产生的分布式力，提出了可微分的建模方法。

Result: 模型在仿真和实际实验中表现出色，强调了路径依赖传感器动态建模的重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了触觉传感器的高精度建模，并为基于梯度的轨迹优化提供了可能。

Abstract: Tactile sensors have long been valued for their perceptual capabilities,
offering rich insights into the otherwise hidden interface between the robot
and grasped objects. Yet their inherent compliance -- a key driver of
force-rich interactions -- remains underexplored. The central challenge is to
capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics introduced by these passive-compliant
elements. Here, we present a computationally efficient non-holonomic
hydroelastic model that accurately models path-dependent contact force
distributions and dynamic surface area variations. Our insight is to extend the
object's state space, explicitly incorporating the distributed forces generated
by the compliant sensor. Our differentiable formulation not only accounts for
path-dependent behavior but also enables gradient-based trajectory
optimization, seamlessly integrating with high-resolution tactile feedback. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of simulated and
real-world experiments and highlight the importance of modeling the path
dependence of sensor dynamics.

Motivation: 解决在密集动态环境中自动驾驶决策系统需同时利用空间结构和长期时间依赖性的问题，并处理低风险状态与高风险决策之间的不平衡。

Method: 提出UWDT框架，利用冻结教师变换器估计预测熵，并将其作为权重用于学生模型的损失函数，以增强对不确定高风险状态的学习。

Result: 在环岛模拟器中，UWDT在奖励、碰撞率和行为稳定性方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的空间-时间变换器能提升自动驾驶在复杂交通环境中的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making
systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal
dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel
framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with
transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout
scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare
safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision
Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate
per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student
model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain,
high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk
transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic
densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of
reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that
uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more
efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

Abstract: Safe and scalable deployment of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving requires
extensive and diverse data, particularly safety-critical events. Existing data
are mostly generated from simulators with a significant sim-to-real gap or
collected from on-road testing that is costly and unsafe. This paper presents
TeraSim-World, an automated pipeline that synthesizes realistic and
geographically diverse safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving at
anywhere in the world. Starting from an arbitrary location, TeraSim-World
retrieves real-world maps and traffic demand from geospatial data sources.
Then, it simulates agent behaviors from naturalistic driving datasets, and
orchestrates diverse adversities to create corner cases. Informed by street
views of the same location, it achieves photorealistic, geographically grounded
sensor rendering via the frontier video generation model Cosmos-Drive. By
bridging agent and sensor simulations, TeraSim-World provides a scalable and
critical~data synthesis framework for training and evaluation of E2E autonomous
driving systems.

Conclusion: ROOM有望为临床难以捕捉的多样患者解剖结构和手术场景提供大规模数据支持。

Abstract: Continuum robots are advancing bronchoscopy procedures by accessing complex
lung airways and enabling targeted interventions. However, their development is
limited by the lack of realistic training and test environments: Real data is
difficult to collect due to ethical constraints and patient safety concerns,
and developing autonomy algorithms requires realistic imaging and physical
feedback. We present ROOM (Realistic Optical Observation in Medicine), a
comprehensive simulation framework designed for generating photorealistic
bronchoscopy training data. By leveraging patient CT scans, our pipeline
renders multi-modal sensor data including RGB images with realistic noise and
light specularities, metric depth maps, surface normals, optical flow and point
clouds at medically relevant scales. We validate the data generated by ROOM in
two canonical tasks for medical robotics -- multi-view pose estimation and
monocular depth estimation, demonstrating diverse challenges that
state-of-the-art methods must overcome to transfer to these medical settings.
Furthermore, we show that the data produced by ROOM can be used to fine-tune
existing depth estimation models to overcome these challenges, also enabling
other downstream applications such as navigation. We expect that ROOM will
enable large-scale data generation across diverse patient anatomies and
procedural scenarios that are challenging to capture in clinical settings. Code

Motivation: 开门是人形机器人在日常环境中必需的基本技能，但由于门的未观测状态（如门闩状态）导致了长视野任务中的部分可观测问题，传统的模仿学习方法容易产生模式崩溃。

Result: 在真实办公室环境中，StageACT对未见过门的成功率达到了55%，是基线方法的两倍以上，同时支持行为引导和恢复。

Conclusion: 阶段条件是一种轻量级但强大的机制，适用于长视野的人形机器人定位-操控任务。

Abstract: Humanoid robots promise to operate in everyday human environments without
requiring modifications to the surroundings. Among the many skills needed,
opening doors is essential, as doors are the most common gateways in built
spaces and often limit where a robot can go. Door opening, however, poses
unique challenges as it is a long-horizon task under partial observability,
such as reasoning about the door's unobservable latch state that dictates
whether the robot should rotate the handle or push the door. This ambiguity
makes standard behavior cloning prone to mode collapse, yielding blended or
out-of-sequence actions. We introduce StageACT, a stage-conditioned imitation
learning framework that augments low-level policies with task-stage inputs.
This effective addition increases robustness to partial observability, leading
to higher success rates and shorter completion times. On a humanoid operating
in a real-world office environment, StageACT achieves a 55% success rate on
previously unseen doors, more than doubling the best baseline. Moreover, our
method supports intentional behavior guidance through stage prompting, enabling
recovery behaviors. These results highlight stage conditioning as a lightweight
yet powerful mechanism for long-horizon humanoid loco-manipulation.

Abstract: We present a hierarchical RL pipeline for training one-armed legged robots to
perform pick-and-place (P&P) tasks end-to-end -- from approaching the payload
to releasing it at a target area -- in both single-robot and cooperative
dual-robot settings. We introduce a novel dynamic reward curriculum that
enables a single policy to efficiently learn long-horizon P&P operations by
progressively guiding the agents through payload-centered sub-objectives.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches for long-horizon RL tasks, our method
improves training efficiency by 55% and reduces execution time by 18.6% in
simulation experiments. In the dual-robot case, we show that our policy enables
each robot to attend to different components of its observation space at
distinct task stages, promoting effective coordination via autonomous attention
shifts. We validate our method through real-world experiments using ANYmal D
platforms in both single- and dual-robot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is
the first RL pipeline that tackles the full scope of collaborative P&P with two
legged manipulators.

Abstract: The endurance and energy efficiency of drones remain critical challenges in
their design and operation. To extend mission duration, numerous studies
explored perching mechanisms that enable drones to conserve energy by
temporarily suspending flight. This paper presents a new perching drone that
utilizes an active flexible perching mechanism inspired by the rapid predation
mechanism of the Venus flytrap, achieving perching in less than 100 ms. The
proposed system is designed for high-speed adaptability to the perching
targets. The overall drone design is outlined, followed by the development and
validation of the biomimetic perching structure. To enhance the system
stability, a cascade extended high-gain observer (EHGO) based control method is
developed, which can estimate and compensate for the external disturbance in
real time. The experimental results demonstrate the adaptability of the
perching structure and the superiority of the cascaded EHGO in resisting wind
and perching disturbances.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了性能且避免了过拟合。

Conclusion: 通过端到端优化特征变换与提升过程，实现了高效和有效的性能提升，代码已开源。

Abstract: We propose a soft gradient boosting framework for sequential regression that
embeds a learnable linear feature transform within the boosting procedure. At
each boosting iteration, we train a soft decision tree and learn a linear input
feature transform Q together. This approach is particularly advantageous in
high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios, as it discovers the most relevant
input representations while boosting. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and
real-world datasets, that our method effectively and efficiently increases the
performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and
boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to
differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not a problem. To

Conclusion: HVN为无限维希尔伯特空间中的信号处理提供了有效的学习框架，并展示了其鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical
covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known
about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In
this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning
framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define
Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs)
as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a
principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can
recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the
versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate
real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we
validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification
tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.

Conclusion: 为学习未知二次函数提供了误差界限，展示了梯度下降迭代与真实极小值之间的误差。

Abstract: We study data-driven least squares (LS) problems with semidefinite (SD)
constraints and derive finite-sample guarantees on the spectrum of their
optimal solutions when these constraints are relaxed. In particular, we provide
a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the
full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting
solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The
developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data
increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only
requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the
SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the
error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained
with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.

Abstract: This paper presents MPC-CDF, a new approach integrating control density
functions (CDFs) within a model predictive control (MPC) framework to ensure
safety-critical control in nonlinear dynamical systems. By using the dual
formulation of the navigation problem, we incorporate CDFs into the MPC
framework, ensuring both convergence and safety in a discrete-time setting.
These density functions are endowed with a physical interpretation, where the
associated measure signifies the occupancy of system trajectories. Leveraging
this occupancy-based perspective, we synthesize safety-critical controllers
using the proposed MPC-CDF framework. We illustrate the safety properties of
this framework using a unicycle model and compare it with a control barrier
function-based method. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated in the
autonomous safe navigation of an underwater vehicle, which avoids complex and
arbitrary obstacles while achieving the desired level of safety.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in autonomous driving have introduced increasingly
complex, real-time GPU-bound tasks critical for reliable vehicle operation.
However, the proprietary nature of these autonomous systems and closed-source
GPU drivers hinder fine-grained control over GPU executions, often resulting in
missed deadlines that compromise vehicle performance. To address this, we
present UrgenGo, a non-intrusive, urgency-aware GPU scheduling system that
operates without access to application source code. UrgenGo implicitly
prioritizes GPU executions through transparent kernel launch manipulation,
employing task-level stream binding, delayed kernel launching, and batched
kernel launch synchronization. We conducted extensive real-world evaluations in
collaboration with a self-driving startup, developing 11 GPU-bound task chains
for a realistic autonomous navigation application and implementing our system
on a self-driving bus. Our results show a significant 61% reduction in the
overall deadline miss ratio, compared to the state-of-the-art GPU scheduler

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for estimation theory by introducing
a second-order diagnostic for estimator design. While classical analysis
focuses on the bias-variance trade-off, we present a more foundational
constraint. This result is model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and is valid for
both parametric and non-parametric problems, Bayesian and frequentist
frameworks. We propose to classify the estimators into three primary power
regimes. We theoretically establish that any estimator operating in the
`power-dominant regime' incurs an unavoidable mean-squared error penalty,
making it structurally prone to sub-optimal performance. We propose a
`safe-zone law' and make this diagnostic intuitive through two safe-zone maps.
One map is a geometric visualization analogous to a receiver operating
characteristic curve for estimators, and the other map shows that the safe-zone
corresponds to a bounded optimization problem, while the forbidden
`power-dominant zone' represents an unbounded optimization landscape. This
framework reframes estimator design as a path optimization problem, providing
new theoretical underpinnings for regularization and inspiring novel design
philosophies.

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

*Zhiwei Zheng,Dongyin Hu,Mingmin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveVerse是一个基于提示的可扩展框架，通过生成室内场景和人体动作来模拟真实射频信号，解决了动态多样环境中高质量射频数据收集的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 射频（RF）传感是一种隐私保护的室内感知方法，但在动态多样的环境中收集高质量数据仍具挑战性。

Method: WaveVerse结合了语言引导的4D世界生成器（含状态感知因果变换器）和相位相干射线追踪模拟器，生成空间约束和文本条件下的人体动作及射频信号。

Result: 实验显示WaveVerse在条件人体动作生成和相位相干性（应用于波束成形和呼吸监测）方面有效，并在ML成像和活动识别中提升性能。

Conclusion: WaveVerse首次实现了射频成像数据生成，且在数据有限或充足场景下均表现优异。

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

*Yihong Ji,Yunze Liu,Yiyao Zhuo,Weijiang Yu,Fei Ma,Joshua Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了在线人-物交互（HOI）生成与感知的新任务，并设计了基于Mamba框架的OnlineHOI网络架构，结合记忆机制，在多个在线任务中取得了领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI方法在离线场景下表现良好，但在在线场景（仅依赖当前和历史数据）中表现不佳，因此需要专门针对在线设置的新方法。

Method: 提出了OnlineHOI框架，基于Mamba架构并结合记忆机制，高效整合历史信息以处理流式数据。

Result: 在Core4D、OAKINK2在线生成任务及HOI4D在线感知任务中实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: OnlineHOI框架有效解决了在线HOI任务的挑战，证明了其在真实场景中的适用性和优越性。

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AsyMoE架构，针对视觉和语言处理的不对称性问题，通过三种专家模块提升跨模态任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合专家方法在处理视觉和语言的不对称性时表现不佳，特别是语言专家在深层网络中逐渐失去上下文关联性。

Method: 提出AsyMoE，包含三种专家：模态内专家、双曲跨模态专家和证据优先语言专家，分别处理模态特异性、跨模态交互和抑制参数偏差。

Result: 实验显示，AsyMoE在准确率上比传统混合专家方法提升26.58%和15.45%，且参数激活量减少25.45%。

Conclusion: AsyMoE通过针对性设计有效解决了跨模态不对称性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.
