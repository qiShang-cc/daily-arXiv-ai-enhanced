In this paper, we\npresent JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware\naccelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse,\nhigh-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural\nnetwork architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the\ntraditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving\ncomputational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our\nproposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+\ndataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To\nfurther enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of\nactivation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization.\nThrough software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at\n400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames\nPer Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\\mu$J/frame.

In this context, systems that launch their satellites\nearlier (referred to as primary systems) are given spectrum access priority\nover those that launch later, known as secondary systems. For a secondary\nsystem to function, it is expected to either coordinate with primary systems or\nensure that it does not cause excessive interference to primary ground users.\nReliably meeting this interference constraint requires real-time knowledge of\nthe receive beams of primary users, which in turn depends on the primary\nsatellite-to-primary user associations. However, in practice, primary systems\nhave thus far not publicly disclosed their satellite assignment policies;\ntherefore, it becomes essential for secondary systems to develop methods to\ninfer such policies. Assuming there is limited historical data indicating which\nprimary satellites have served which primary users, we propose an end-to-end\ngraph structure learning-based algorithm for learning highest elevation primary\nsatellite assignment policies, that, upon deployment, can directly map the\nprimary satellite coordinates into assignment decisions for the primary users.\nSimulation results show that our method can outperform the best baseline,\nachieving approximately a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy."}

We introduce\nInformation Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making\nframework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to\nalign internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both\nagent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to\nactively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,\ndetect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising\ntask-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark\nsuite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations\nand uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%\nabsolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample\nefficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms\nbaselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web\nnavigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating\nplanning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable\nenvironments.

Project page:\n  https://metadriverse.github.io/ppl", "summary": "Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to\nmonitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation\nlearning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,\nthey do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more\nhazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from\nHuman Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals\ncontained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The\nkey idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time\nsteps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent\nfollows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the\npreference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,\nexpert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the\nagent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and\nreducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments\non both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate\nits efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that\nselecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states\nwith label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

However, current\nVLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final\nactions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.\nTheir post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying\nprimarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these\nchallenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates\nReinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and\nexecution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with\nverifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output\nformatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.\nMoreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides\nchain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory\nannotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,\nsimulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior\ngeneralization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods.

Our approach performs point-wise\nreconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based\nframework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as\nlocally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the\nconformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately\ncomputes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples\nconstraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other\napproaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity\nof the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative\noptimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,\nutilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D\npoint clouds with texture.
