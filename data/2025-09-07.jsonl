A frequently overlooked but critical factor is the agent\nitself, e.g., the user carrying the device, which potentially obstructs\nline-of-sight (LOS) links to the base stations (anchors). This paper addresses\nthe problem of accurate positioning in scenarios where LOS links are partially\nblocked by the agent. The agent is modeled as an extended object (EO) that\nscatters, attenuates, and blocks radio signals. We propose a Bayesian method\nthat fuses ``active'' measurements (between device and anchors) with\n``passive'' multistatic radar-type measurements (between anchors, reflected by\nthe EO). To handle measurement origin uncertainty, we introduce an multi-sensor\nand multiple-measurement probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm that\njointly fuses all EO-related measurements. Furthermore, we develop an EO model\ntailored to agents such as human users, accounting for multiple reflections\nscattered off the body surface, and propose a simplified variant for\nlow-complexity implementation. Evaluation on both synthetic and real radio\nmeasurements demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional\nPDA methods based on point target assumptions, particularly during and after\nobstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) conditions."}

ACCEPTED JUNE, 2025 AND PRESENTED SEPTEMBER, 2025", "summary": "This paper presents the design of a pose estimator for a four wheel\nindependent steer four wheel independent drive (4WIS4WID) wall climbing mobile\nrobot, based on the fusion of multimodal measurements, including wheel\nodometry, visual odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using\nExtended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The pose\nestimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their\noperational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and\nmaintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the\nbuilding at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material\nproperties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors\nsuch as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing\nrobots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these\nenvironments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and\nelectromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary\nsource of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift\ncaused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the\nrobot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and\nLevenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting\nmethods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as\nstochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and\nresults of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail\nwith experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot."}

Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of\nthe object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects\nefficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.\nCurrent methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating\npotential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance.

To this end, we propose a computationally\nefficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most\ninformative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the\ncamera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the\nwhole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint\nwithout the need for an additional path planner.
