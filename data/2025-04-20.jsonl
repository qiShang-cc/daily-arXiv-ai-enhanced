In recent\nyears, learning models such as autoencoders (AE) have been studied for CSI\ncompression, aiming to eliminate model assumptions and reduce compression loss.\nHowever, current learning methods are often designed and trained mainly for\nindividual channel scenarios, with limited generalizability across different\nscenarios, of which the channel characteristics are prominently discrepant.\nMotivated by this, we propose a novel AE-based learning method named\nattention-infused autoencoder network (AiANet), which can parallelly and\nadaptively extract channel-wise and spatial features of CSI with an attention\nfusion mechanism. In addition, a locally-aware self-attention mechanism is\ndeveloped to extract both global and local spatial patterns, to better capture\nthe unique CSI features of different scenarios. Moreover, a mixed-training\nscheme is introduced to enable the proposed AiANet to gain generalizability\nacross indoor and outdoor scenarios. Results show that when trained and tested\nin the same scenario, AiANet can substantially outperform the existing AE-based\nmethods such as ACRNet, with an improvement of up to 3.42 dB in terms of\nnormalized mean squared error (NMSE). With the mixed-training scheme, AiANet\nexhibits superior cross-scenario generalizability compared to the benchmark\nmethods which are trained in one scenario and misused in another."}
