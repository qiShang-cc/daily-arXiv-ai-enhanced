*Sakila S. Jayaweera,Beibei Wang,Wei-Hsiang Wang,K. J. Ray Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: DeepCPD是一种基于深度学习的儿童车内存在检测系统，利用WiFi信道状态信息中的自相关函数（ACF）捕获人体特征，通过Transformer和MLP架构区分成人与儿童，显著提高了检测准确性。


<details>

Abstract: Child presence detection (CPD) is a vital technology for vehicles to prevent
heat-related fatalities or injuries by detecting the presence of a child left
unattended. Regulatory agencies around the world are planning to mandate CPD
systems in the near future. However, existing solutions have limitations in
terms of accuracy, coverage, and additional device requirements. While
WiFi-based solutions can overcome the limitations, existing approaches struggle
to reliably distinguish between adult and child presence, leading to frequent
false alarms, and are often sensitive to environmental variations. In this
paper, we present DeepCPD, a novel deep learning framework designed for
accurate child presence detection in smart vehicles. DeepCPD utilizes an
environment-independent feature-the auto-correlation function (ACF) derived
from WiFi channel state information (CSI)-to capture human-related signatures
while mitigating environmental distortions. A Transformer-based architecture,
followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP), is employed to differentiate adults
from children by modeling motion patterns and subtle body size differences. To
address the limited availability of in-vehicle child and adult data, we
introduce a two-stage learning strategy that significantly enhances model
generalization. Extensive experiments conducted across more than 25 car models
and over 500 hours of data collection demonstrate that DeepCPD achieves an
overall accuracy of 92.86%, outperforming a CNN baseline by a substantial
margin (79.55%). Additionally, the model attains a 91.45% detection rate for
children while maintaining a low false alarm rate of 6.14%.

Abstract: The integration of pattern-reconfigurable antennas into hybrid multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) architectures presents a promising path toward
high-efficiency and low-cost transceiver solutions. Pattern-reconfigurable
antennas can dynamically steer per-antenna radiation patterns, enabling more
efficient power utilization and interference suppression. In this work, we
study a tri-hybrid MIMO architecture for multi-user communication that
integrates digital, analog, and antenna-domain precoding using
pattern-reconfigurable antennas. For characterizing the reconfigurability of
antenna radiation patterns, we develop two models -- Model~I and Model~II.
Model~I captures realistic hardware constraints through limited pattern
selection, while Model~II explores the performance upper bound by assuming
arbitrary pattern generation. Based on these models, we develop two
corresponding tri-hybrid precoding algorithms grounded in the weighted minimum
mean square error (WMMSE) framework, which alternately optimize the digital,
analog, and antenna precoders under practical per-antenna power constraints.
Realistic simulations conducted in ray-tracing generated environments are
utilized to evaluate the proposed system and algorithms. The results
demonstrate the significant potential of the considered tri-hybrid architecture
in enhancing communication performance and hardware efficiency. However, they
also reveal that the existing hardware is not yet capable of fully realizing
these performance gains, underscoring the need for joint progress in antenna
design and communication theory development.

### [3] [Bandlimited signal reconstruction from orthogonally-projected data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08963)
*Nguyen T. Thao,Marek Miskowicz*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了一种信号采集方案的广义框架，基于正交投影和交替投影方法（POCS），在新兴复杂编码器和非理想条件下展现了稳健的收敛性和最优近似性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信号重建方法在处理新兴复杂编码器（如事件采样）或非理想条件（如噪声、亚奈奎斯特采样）时效率不足。本文旨在提供一种统一框架，解决这些问题。

Method: 采用交替投影法（POCS），在输入空间和仿射空间之间迭代，适用于离散采样和非可分输入空间。理论框架基于无限维希尔伯特空间。

Result: 方法在新编码器中稳健收敛，在非理想条件下实现最优最小二乘近似，半收敛性自然提供正则化，且可严格离散化实现。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了传统完美重建的范畴，为复杂采样场景提供了理论支持和实践工具，保持了与香农采样理论的一致性。

Abstract: We show that a broad class of signal acquisition schemes can be interpreted
as recording data from a signal $x$ in a space $\cal U$ (typically, though not
exclusively, a space of bandlimited functions) via an orthogonal projection $w
= P_{\cal V} x$ onto another space $\cal V$. A basic reconstruction method in
this case consists in alternating projections between the input space $\cal U$
and the affine space $\cal W$ of signals $u$ satisfying $P_{\cal V} u = w$
(POCS method). Although this method is classically known to be slow, our work
reveals new insights and contributions: (i) it applies to new complex encoders
emerging from event-based sampling, for which no faster reconstruction method
is currently available; (ii) beyond perfect reconstruction, it converges
robustly under insufficient (e.g., sub-Nyquist) or inconsistent data (due to
noise or errors); (iii) the limit of convergence achieves optimal least-squares
approximations under such conditions; (iv) semi-convergence inherently results
in regularized reconstructions under ill-posed data acquisition conditions; (v)
when $w$ is produced by discrete sampling, the iterative method can be
rigorously discretized for DSP implementation -- even with non-separable input
spaces $\cal U$. While moving beyond the traditional focus on perfect
reconstruction in harmonic analysis, our analysis preserves the deterministic
framework of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, consistent with Shannon's
sampling theory. For illustration, we apply our proposed theory to two
contrasting sampling situations: multi-channel time encoding and nonuniform
point sampling in a Sobolev space.

### [4] [Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna System Aided OTFS Satellite Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09028)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的FAS-OTFS框架，结合流体天线系统（FAS）和正交时频空间（OTFS）调制，显著提升了卫星物联网在高移动性环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于卫星链路在高移动性环境下存在严重的多普勒效应和延迟扩展，而物联网设备又受限于空间和能源，因此需要一种更高效的技术来实现可靠的数据传输。

Method: 作者提出了FAS-OTFS框架，推导了其在一般信道模型下的中断概率和遍历容量的解析表达式，并通过数值实验验证其性能优于传统OTFS系统。

Result: 实验结果表明，FAS-OTFS在中断概率和容量方面均表现显著优于传统OTFS系统，适合应用于能源受限的高移动性场景。

Conclusion: FAS-OTFS被证明是下一代卫星物联网通信的有力候选方案。

Abstract: Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks typically rely on satellite communications
to provide coverage in rural areas. However, high-mobility satellite links
introduce severe Doppler and delay spreads, which necessitate the use of
orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation for reliable data
transmission. Furthermore, the space and energy constraints on IoT devices make
the perfect use case for fluid antenna systems (FAS) due to their mechanical
simplicity. Hence, we propose a sophisticated FAS aided OTFS (FAS-OTFS)
framework for satellite-based IoT networks. We derive analytical expressions
for both the outage probability and ergodic capacity of FAS-OTFS under a
general channel model, where the expressions derived are presented in integral
form or as analytical bounds for efficient numerical evaluation. Additionally,
we investigate a single-path fading scenario, where closed-form expressions are
obtained. Our numerical results demonstrate significant performance gains in
terms of both the outage probability and capacity compared to conventional OTFS
systems, confirming the efficacy of FAS-OTFS in energy-constrained
high-mobility environments. Our findings establish FAS-OTFS as a promising
candidate for next-generation IoT communications over satellite links.

### [5] [Mainlobe Jamming Suppression Using MIMO-STCA Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09112)

Conclusion: 研究验证了MIMO-STCA框架与自适应算法的结合能有效应对复杂干扰环境，为雷达抗干扰技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: Radar jamming suppression, particularly against mainlobe jamming, has become
a critical focus in modern radar systems. This article investigates advanced
mainlobe jamming suppression techniques utilizing a novel multiple-input
multiple-output space-time coding array (MIMO-STCA) radar. Extending the
capabilities of traditional MIMO radar, the MIMO-STCA framework introduces
additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the range domain through the
utilization of transmit time delays, offering enhanced resilience against
interference. One of the key challenges in mainlobe jamming scenarios is the
difficulty in obtaining interference-plus-noise samples that are free from
target signal contamination. To address this, the study introduces a cumulative
sampling-based non-homogeneous sample selection (CS-NHSS) algorithm to remove
target-contaminated samples, ensuring accurate interference-plus-noise
covariance matrix estimation and effective noise subspace separation. Building
on this, the subsequent step is to apply the proposed noise subspace-based
jamming mitigation (NSJM) algorithm, which leverages the orthogonality between
noise and jamming subspace for effective jamming mitigation. However, NSJM
performance can degrade due to spatial frequency mismatches caused by DoA or
range quantization errors. To overcome this limitation, the study further
proposes the robust jamming mitigation via noise subspace (RJNS) algorithm,
incorporating adaptive beampattern control to achieve a flat-top mainlobe and
broadened nulls, enhancing both anti-jamming effectiveness and robustness under
non-ideal conditions. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms. Significant improvements in mainlobe jamming suppression
are demonstrated through transmit-receive beampattern analysis and enhanced
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) curve.

### [6] [Sensing-Assisted Channel Prediction in Complex Wireless Environments: An LLM-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09141)

Abstract: This letter studies the sensing-assisted channel prediction for a
multi-antenna orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system
operating in realistic and complex wireless environments. In this system,an
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) transmitter leverages the
mono-static sensing capability to facilitate the prediction of its bi-static
communication channel, by exploiting the fact that the sensing and
communication channels share the same physical environment involving shared
scatterers. Specifically, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based
channel prediction approach,which adapts pre-trained text-based LLM to handle
the complex-matrix-form channel state information (CSI) data. This approach
utilizes the LLM's strong ability to capture the intricate spatiotemporal
relationships between the multi-path sensing and communication channels, and
thus efficiently predicts upcoming communication CSI based on historical
communication and sensing CSI data. Experimental results show that the proposed
LLM-based approach significantly outperforms conventional deep learning-based
methods and the benchmark scheme without sensing assistance.

### [7] [Trellis Waveform Shaping for Sidelobe Reduction in Integrated Sensing and Communications: A Duality with PAPR Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09173)
*Henglin Pu,Husheng Li,Zhu Han,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于OFDM的集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统，利用网格成形技术优化波形以降低旁瓣水平，从而提升感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在ISAC系统中，通信波形的随机性可能导致高旁瓣水平，影响弱目标的感知性能。为改善这一问题，研究受OFDM中PAPR降低算法的启发，探索波形优化方法。

Result: 通过数值仿真和软件定义无线电（USRP）实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功降低了OFDM波形的旁瓣水平，证明了在ISAC系统中提升感知性能的可行性。

Abstract: A key challenge in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is the
synthesis of waveforms that can modulate communication messages and achieve
good sensing performance simultaneously. In ISAC systems, standard
communication waveforms can be adapted for sensing, as the sensing receiver
(co-located with the transmitter) has knowledge of the communication message
and consequently the waveform. However, the randomness of communications may
result in waveforms that have high sidelobes masking weak targets. Thus, it is
desirable to refine communication waveforms to improve the sensing performance
by reducing the integrated sidelobe levels (ISL). This is similar to the
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) mitigation in orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), in which the OFDM-modulated waveform needs to be refined
to reduce the PAPR. In this paper, inspired by PAPR reduction algorithms in
OFDM, we employ trellis shaping in OFDM-based ISAC systems to refine waveforms
for specific sensing metrics using convolutional codes and Viterbi decoding. In
such a scheme, the communication data is encoded and then mapped to the
signaling constellation in different subcarriers, such that the time-domain
sidelobes are reduced. An interesting observation is that sidelobe reduction in
OFDM-based ISAC is dual to PAPR reduction in OFDM, thereby sharing a similar
signaling structure. Numerical simulations and hardware software defined radio
USRP experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed trellis shaping approach.

Abstract: The identification of nonlinear systems is a frequent task in digital signal
processing. Such nonlinear systems may be grouped into many sub-classes,
whereby numerous nonlinear real-world systems can be approximated as bilinear
(BL) models. Therefore, various optimum and adaptive BL filters have been
introduced in recent years. Further, in many applications such as
communications and radar, complex-valued (CV) BL systems in combination with CV
signals may occur. Hence, in this work, we investigate the extension of
real-valued (RV) BL filters to CV BL filters. First, we derive CV BL filters by
applying two or four RV BL filters, and compare them with respect to their
computational complexity and performance. Second, we introduce novel fully CV
BL filters, such as the CV BL Wiener filter (WF), the CV BL least squares (LS)
filter, the CV BL least mean squares (LMS) filter, the CV BL normalized LMS
(NLMS) filter, and the CV BL recursive least squares (RLS) filter. Finally,
these filters are applied to identify multiple-input-single-output (MISO)
systems and Hammerstein models.

### [9] [Empirical Study on Near-Field and Spatial Non-Stationarity Modeling for THz XL-MIMO Channel in Indoor Scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09398)
*Huixin Xu,Jianhua Zhang,Pan Tang,Hongbo Xing,Chong Han,Lei Tian,Qixing Wang,Guangyi Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种考虑近场传播和空间非平稳性的太赫兹XL-MIMO信道模型，并通过实测数据验证了其准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着频率和阵列尺寸的增加，用户更容易进入近场区域，传统的远场平面波假设失效，同时引入空间非平稳性（SnS）。因此，需要一种新的信道模型来捕捉这些特征。

Method: 通过太赫兹XL-MIMO信道测量（100 GHz和132 GHz），观察近场效应和SnS现象，提出了一种混合近场信道建模方法（散射点源模型和镜面反射模型），并引入幅度衰减因子（AAFs）来建模SnS。

Result: 模型验证显示，其能准确捕捉熵容量、条件数、空间相关性、信道增益、Rician K因子和RMS时延扩展等关键指标，与实测数据高度吻合。

Conclusion: 提出的模型有效表征了太赫兹XL-MIMO信道的近场效应和空间非平稳性，为6G及以后的通信系统设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) is considered a key
enabling technology for 6G and beyond due to its advantages such as wide
bandwidth and high beam gain. As the frequency and array size increase, users
are more likely to fall within the near-field (NF) region, where the far-field
plane-wave assumption no longer holds. This also introduces spatial
non-stationarity (SnS), as different antenna elements observe distinct
multipath characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes a THz XL-MIMO channel
model that accounts for both NF propagation and SnS, validated using channel
measurement data. In this work, we first conduct THz XL-MIMO channel
measurements at 100 GHz and 132 GHz using 301- and 531-element ULAs in indoor
environments, revealing pronounced NF effects characterized by nonlinear
inter-element phase variations, as well as element-dependent delay and angle
shifts. Moreover, the SnS phenomenon is observed, arising not only from
blockage but also from inconsistent reflection or scattering. Based on these
observations, a hybrid NF channel modeling approach combining the
scatterer-excited point-source model and the specular reflection model is
proposed to capture nonlinear phase variation. For SnS modeling, amplitude
attenuation factors (AAFs) are introduced to characterize the continuous
variation of path power across the array. By analyzing the statistical
distribution and spatial autocorrelation properties of AAFs, a statistical
rank-matching-based method is proposed for their generation. Finally, the model
is validated using measured data. Evaluation across metrics such as entropy
capacity, condition number, spatial correlation, channel gain, Rician K-factor,
and RMS delay spread confirms that the proposed model closely aligns with
measurements and effectively characterizes the essential features of THz
XL-MIMO channels.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可穿戴系统，用于监测生理学和爆炸暴露水平，并利用机器学习融合多生理指标预测爆炸暴露风险。结果显示低至0.25 psi的爆炸压力也可能引发生理变化，系统在武器训练环境中具有实用性。

Conclusion: 可穿戴系统在武器训练等环境中具有实用性，结合多种生理信号能提高敏感性，可作为脑健康评估的补充。

Abstract: Repeated exposure to blast overpressure in occupational settings has been
associated with changes in cognitive and psychological health, as well as
deficits in neurosensory subsystems. In this work, we describe a wearable
system to simultaneously monitor physiology and blast exposure levels and
demonstrate how this system can identify individualized exposure levels
corresponding to acute physiological response to blast exposure. Machine
learning was used to develop a dose-response model that fused multiple
physiological measures (electrooculuography, gait, and balance) into a single
risk score by predicting the level of blast exposure on held-out subjects
(Fused model, R = 0.60). We found that blast events with peak pressure levels
as low as 0.25 psi could be related to physiological changes and hence may
contribute to blast injury. We also identified an individual subject with
deteriorating reaction time scores that consistently showed a rapid and
anomalous change in physiology-based risk scores after exposure to low-level
blast events. Our results suggest that the wearable approach to blast
monitoring is viable in weapons training environments as a complement to more
direct but sparsely administered brain health assessments, potentially viable
in austere environments, and that fusing multiple physiological signals can
improve sensitivity.

Abstract: Near-field focusing (NFF) forms the basis for several applications of large
intelligent surface (LIS) in sub-10 GHz bands, including wireless
communications, wireless power transfer, positioning, and sensing. In this
two-part paper, Part I analyzed the properties of phase conjugation NFF for
vertically polarized antennas, in a circular array configuration. In Part II of
this article, we continue to study phase conjugation NFF for circular arrays,
but for horizontally polarized antennas. We investigate the focusing
characteristics of a circular array in two distinct configurations. The
numerical results show that the first configuration where all the antenna
elements (including the user antenna) are aligned offers significant better
performance in terms of peak gain, 3 dB focal width and sidelobe level,
relative to the second configuration where the broadside of the elements faces
the array center. This result points to the beneficial use of orthogonally
oriented horizontally polarized antenna at the user to allow for flexible
polarization alignment with the fixed array orientation. In addition, the
vertical polarized circular array of Part I may be merged with the first
configuration of Part II to provide optimal NFF to a randomly oriented user
equipment with a polarization reconfigurable tripole antenna.

Abstract: Large intelligent surface (LIS) is one promising path to leverage 6G
performance in sub-10 GHz bands. This two-part paper explores the properties of
phase-conjugation focusing for a simplified LIS setup with a two-dimensional
(2D) circular antenna array and a user antenna located within the array
aperture in the same plane. In Part I of this article, we assume vertical
polarization for all antenna elements, whereas Part II assumes horizontal
polarization. In Part I, we focus on the effect of array radius on the peak
gain, 3 dB focusing width, and sidelobes for two types of circular arrays. The
numerical results show that the gain minimum is located at the array center.
The peak gain varies by less than 0.5 dB for focal points located within 2 from
the array center. Similarly, the focal width and sidelobe level are also stable
within this region, irrespective of array radius. From 2 from the center to the
array edge, the closer proximity of the focal points to some array elements
than other elements results in more drastic changes in these NFF properties.
Finally, full-wave simulation using Ansys HFSS is used to partially validate
the numerical results.

Abstract: Conventional analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuit designs heavily rely on
manual effort, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper presents
a fully automated design methodology for Successive Approximation Register
(SAR) Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) from performance specifications to
complete transistor sizing. To tackle the high-dimensional sizing problem, we
propose a dual optimization scheme. The system-level optimization iteratively
partitions the overall requirements and analytically maps them to subcircuit
design specifications, while local optimization loops determines the
subcircuits' design parameters. The dependency graph-based framework serializes
the simulations for verification, knowledge-based calculations, and transistor
sizing optimization in topological order, which eliminates the need for human
intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology
through two case studies with varying performance specifications, achieving
high SNDR and low power consumption while meeting all the specified design
constraints.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何将毫米波收发器的大规模波束成形码本缩减为少量导向矢量，同时覆盖整个角度空间并保持接近最大阵列增益的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于用户终端的移动性和方向随机变化，需要不断调整波束方向。现有的大码本虽然能提供高角度分辨率，但搜索时间过长。本研究的动机是找到一种方法，在保持性能的同时显著减少码本大小。

Method: 论文推导了导向矢量的角度覆盖范围的闭式表达式，确保增益损失在设定范围内（如2 dB）。该方法通过理论和实验验证了大码本可缩减为少量导向矢量。

Result: 理论和实验证明，即使是极大的波束成形码本（如1024^16）也能缩减为少量导向矢量，且仍能保持接近最大增益的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，仅需少量导向矢量即可实现接近最大增益的效果，挑战了传统认为大码本和高角度分辨率是天线阵列性能关键的观念。

Abstract: Modern millimeter wave (mmWave) transceivers come with a large number of
antennas, each of which can support thousands of phase shifter configurations.
This capability enables beam sweeping with fine angular resolution, but results
in large codebook sizes that can span more than six orders of magnitude. On the
other hand, the mobility of user terminals and their randomly changing
orientations require constantly adjusting the beam direction. A key focus of
recent research has been on the design of beam sweeping codebooks that balance
a trade-off between the achievable gain and the beam search time, governed by
the codebook size. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which a large
codebook can be reduced to fewer steering vectors while covering the entire
angular space and maintaining performance close to the maximum array gain. We
derive a closed-form expression for the angular coverage range of a steering
vector, subject to maintaining a gain loss within \(\gamma\) dB (e.g., 2\, dB)
with respect to the maximum gain achieved by an infinitely large codebook. We
demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a large beam-steering
codebooks (such as the \(1024^{16}\) set considered in our experiment) can be
reduced to just a few steering vectors. This framework serves as a proof that
only a few steering vectors are sufficient to achieve near-maximum gain,
challenging the common belief that a large codebook with fine angular
resolution is essential to fully reap the benefits of an antenna array.

*Hossein Babaei,Mel White,Sina Alemohammad,Richard G. Baraniuk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 摘要太长；没读总结：本文提出了一种名为SaFARi的新方法，允许在状态空间模型（SSMs）中使用任何框架或基，而不仅限于多项式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SSMs仅探索了少数多项式基，限制了其应用潜力。

Method: 提出了一种通用方法SaFARi，支持任何框架或基的SSMs构建。

Result: SaFARi框架扩展了SSMs的适用性，超越了HiPPO等现有方法。

Conclusion: SaFARi为SSMs提供了更灵活的框架选择，推动了长程依赖数据处理技术的发展。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have re-emerged as a powerful tool for online
function approximation, and as the backbone of machine learning models for
long-range dependent data. However, to date, only a few polynomial bases have
been explored for this purpose, and the state-of-the-art implementations were
built upon the best of a few limited options. In this paper, we present a
generalized method for building an SSM with any frame or basis, rather than
being restricted to polynomials. This framework encompasses the approach known
as HiPPO, but also permits an infinite diversity of other possible "species"
within the SSM architecture. We dub this approach SaFARi: SSMs for
Frame-Agnostic Representation.

*Jiachen Qian,Yang Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了未知线性随机系统的在线预测问题，提出了基于指数遗忘的回归模型平衡方法，优化了回归与正则化误差的权衡，并证明了更优的对数遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于递归最小二乘的方法在未知系统预测中因回归模型高度不平衡而容易过拟合，导致性能下降。

Method: 通过指数遗忘在回归模型中引入归纳偏置，平衡回归模型，以减少过拟合和累积误差。

Result: 提出了新的证明技术，实现了O(log^3 N)的更优对数遗憾界。

Conclusion: 该方法在未知线性随机系统的在线预测中有效平衡了回归与正则化误差，减少了累积误差，提升了预测精度。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online prediction for an unknown, non-explosive
linear stochastic system. With a known system model, the optimal predictor is
the celebrated Kalman filter. In the case of unknown systems, existing
approaches based on recursive least squares and its variants may suffer from
degraded performance due to the highly imbalanced nature of the regression
model. This imbalance can easily lead to overfitting and thus degrade
prediction accuracy. We tackle this problem by injecting an inductive bias into
the regression model via {exponential forgetting}. While exponential forgetting
is a common wisdom in online learning, it is typically used for re-weighting
data. In contrast, our approach focuses on balancing the regression model. This
achieves a better trade-off between {regression} and {regularization errors},
and simultaneously reduces the {accumulation error}. With new proof techniques,
we also provide a sharper logarithmic regret bound of $O(\log^3 N)$, where $N$
is the number of observations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaFortiTran提出了一种自适应强化Transformer模型，用于在快速衰落信道和低信噪比场景下提升OFDM系统的信道估计性能，通过结合卷积层和Transformer编码器来同时捕获局部与全局特征，并通过整合信道统计先验增强适应性，相比现有技术实现了6 dB的MSE降低。

Motivation: 现有深度学习的OFDM信道估计模型在快速衰落信道和低信噪比场景下表现不佳，亟需一种能有效建模时频交互和长距离依赖的鲁棒方法。

Method: 采用卷积层捕获局部相关性，并结合Transformer编码器的全局注意力机制，整合信道统计（SNR、时延扩展、多普勒频移）作为非线性先验，通过残差连接融合局部与全局特征，最终卷积层细化表示。

Result: 在200-1000 Hz多普勒频移、0-25 dB SNR及50-300 ns时延扩展的广泛测试中，AdaFortiTran的MSE比现有最优模型降低6 dB，展现出卓越的高移动性环境鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaFortiTran通过联合局部-全局建模和统计先验整合，显著提升了复杂信道条件下的估计精度，为高移动性OFDM系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models for channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) systems often suffer from performance degradation under
fast-fading channels and low-SNR scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce the Adaptive Fortified Transformer (AdaFortiTran), a novel model
specifically designed to enhance channel estimation in challenging
environments. Our approach employs convolutional layers that exploit locality
bias to capture strong correlations between neighboring channel elements,
combined with a transformer encoder that applies the global Attention mechanism
to channel patches. This approach effectively models both long-range
dependencies and spectro-temporal interactions within single OFDM frames. We
further augment the model's adaptability by integrating nonlinear
representations of available channel statistics SNR, delay spread, and Doppler
shift as priors. A residual connection is employed to merge global features
from the transformer with local features from early convolutional processing,
followed by final convolutional layers to refine the hierarchical channel
representation. Despite its compact architecture, AdaFortiTran achieves up to 6
dB reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to state-of-the-art models.
Tested across a wide range of Doppler shifts (200-1000 Hz), SNRs (0 to 25 dB),
and delay spreads (50-300 ns), it demonstrates superior robustness in
high-mobility environments.

Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel
representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing,
without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless
communications. Aiming to fill this gap, we first propose WiMAE (Wireless
Masked Autoencoder), a transformer-based encoder-decoder foundation model
pretrained on a realistic open-source multi-antenna wireless channel dataset.
Building upon this foundation, we develop ContraWiMAE, which enhances WiMAE by
incorporating a contrastive learning objective alongside the reconstruction
task in a unified multi-task framework. By warm-starting from pretrained WiMAE
weights and generating positive pairs via noise injection, the contrastive
component enables the model to capture both structural and discriminative
features, enhancing representation quality beyond what reconstruction alone can
achieve. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of both approaches across multiple downstream tasks, with
ContraWiMAE showing further improvements in linear separability and
adaptability in diverse wireless environments. Comparative evaluations against
a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior
performance and data efficiency of our models, highlighting their potential as
powerful baselines for future research in self-supervised wireless channel
representation learning.
