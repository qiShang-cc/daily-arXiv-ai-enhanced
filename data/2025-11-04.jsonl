Traditional\nleast-squares methods require prohibitive pilot overhead that scales with\nantenna count, while sparse estimation methods depend on precise channel models\nthat may not always be practical. This paper proposes a model-free approach\ncombining deep autoencoders and LSTM networks. The method first learns\nlow-dimensional channel representations preserving temporal correlation through\naugmenting a channel charting-inspired loss function, then tracks these\nfeatures to recover full channel information from limited pilots. Simulation\nresults using ray-tracing datasets show that the proposed approach achieves up\nto 9 dB improvement in normalized mean square error compared to the\nleast-squares methods under ill-conditioned scenarios, while maintaining\nscalability across MIMO configurations."}

Using synthetic corpora with disentangled public and private\nlabels, we distill students under matched and independent random\ninitializations. We find that transfer strength hinges on alignment within a\ntrait-discriminative subspace: same-seed students inherit this alignment and\nshow higher leakage {\\tau \\approx} 0.24, whereas different-seed\nstudents--despite global CKA > 0.9--exhibit substantially reduced excess\naccuracy {\\tau \\approx} 0.12 - 0.13. We formalize this with subspace-level CKA\ndiagnostic and residualized probes, showing that leakage tracks alignment\nwithin the trait-discriminative subspace rather than global representational\nsimilarity.

As 6G systems are\nexpected to operate at higher frequencies and employ larger antenna arrays than\nfifth-generation (5G) systems, they can also enable more accurate sensing\ncapabilities. To this end, the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)\nparadigm aims to unify the physical and radio frequency (RF) domains by\nintroducing the sensing functionality into the communication network.

Existing\napproaches often struggle to balance fine-grained local control with\ncomprehensive scene understanding, resulting in limited scalability and\ncompromised collaboration quality. In this paper, we present GauDP, a novel\nGaussian-image synergistic representation that facilitates scalable,\nperception-aware imitation learning in multi-agent collaborative systems.\nSpecifically, GauDP constructs a globally consistent 3D Gaussian field from\ndecentralized RGB observations, then dynamically redistributes 3D Gaussian\nattributes to each agent's local perspective. This enables all agents to\nadaptively query task-critical features from the shared scene representation\nwhile maintaining their individual viewpoints. This design facilitates both\nfine-grained control and globally coherent behavior without requiring\nadditional sensing modalities (e.g., 3D point cloud). We evaluate GauDP on the\nRoboFactory benchmark, which includes diverse multi-arm manipulation tasks. Our\nmethod achieves superior performance over existing image-based methods and\napproaches the effectiveness of point-cloud-driven methods, while maintaining\nstrong scalability as the number of agents increases."}

This transformation from concave\nto convex is initiated by changes in turgor pressure and the release of stored\nelastic energy from prestresses in the concave state, which accelerate this\nmovement, leading to inversion of the lobes bi-axial curvature.

This paper explores a training method for\ndomain adaptation to adapt PilotNet, an end-to-end deep learning-based model,\nfor left-hand driving conditions using real-world Australian highway data. Four\ntraining methods were evaluated: (1) a baseline model trained on U.S.\nright-hand driving data, (2) a model trained on flipped U.S. data, (3) a model\npretrained on U.S. data and then fine-tuned on Australian highways, and (4) a\nmodel pretrained on flipped U.S. data and then finetuned on Australian\nhighways. This setup examines whether incorporating flipped data enhances the\nmodel adaptation by providing an initial left-hand driving alignment. The paper\ncompares model performance regarding steering prediction accuracy and\nattention, using saliency-based analysis to measure attention shifts across\nsignificant road regions. Results show that pretraining on flipped data alone\nworsens prediction stability due to misaligned feature representations, but\nsignificantly improves adaptation when followed by fine-tuning, leading to\nlower prediction error and stronger focus on left-side cues. To validate this\napproach across different architectures, the same experiments were done on\nResNet, which confirmed similar adaptation trends. These findings emphasize the\nimportance of preprocessing techniques, such as flipped-data pretraining,\nfollowed by fine-tuning to improve model adaptation with minimal retraining\nrequirements."}

Recently, deep learning models representing\nCLFs have been applied into a learner-verifier framework to identify\nsatisfiable candidates. However, the learner treats Lyapunov conditions as\ncomplex constraints for optimisation, which is hard to achieve global\nconvergence. It is also too complicated to implement these Lyapunov conditions\nfor verification. To improve this framework, we treat Lyapunov conditions as\ninductive biases and design a neural CLF and a CLF-based controller guided by\nthis knowledge. This design enables a stable optimisation process with limited\nconstraints, and allows end-to-end learning of both the CLF and the controller.\nOur approach achieves a higher convergence rate and larger region of attraction\n(ROA) in learning the CLF compared to existing methods among abundant\nexperiment cases.

While deterministic deep\nnetworks achieve impressive performance under well-constrained conditions, they\nare often overconfident and fail to capture the multi-modality of the\nunderlying pose distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nprobabilistic framework that leverages flow matching on the SE(3) manifold for\nestimating 6D object pose distributions. Unlike existing methods that regress a\nsingle deterministic output, our approach models the full pose distribution\nwith a sample-based estimate and enables reasoning about uncertainty in\nambiguous cases such as symmetric objects or severe occlusions. We achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on Real275, YCB-V, and LM-O, and demonstrate how our\nsample-based pose estimates can be leveraged in downstream robotic manipulation\ntasks such as active perception for disambiguating uncertain viewpoints or\nguiding grasp synthesis in an uncertainty-aware manner."}

However, most methods\ntreat ego-motion as an auxiliary task, either mixing all motion types or\nexcluding depth-independent rotational motions in supervision. Such designs\nlimit the incorporation of strong geometric constraints, reducing reliability\nand robustness under diverse conditions. This study introduces a discriminative\ntreatment of motion components, leveraging the geometric regularities of their\nrespective rigid flows to benefit both depth and ego-motion estimation. Given\nconsecutive video frames, network outputs first align the optical axes and\nimaging planes of the source and target cameras. Optical flows between frames\nare transformed through these alignments, and deviations are quantified to\nimpose geometric constraints individually on each ego-motion component,\nenabling more targeted refinement. These alignments further reformulate the\njoint learning process into coaxial and coplanar forms, where depth and each\ntranslation component can be mutually derived through closed-form geometric\nrelationships, introducing complementary constraints that improve depth\nrobustness. DiMoDE, a general depth and ego-motion joint learning framework\nincorporating these designs, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple\npublic datasets and a newly collected diverse real-world dataset, particularly\nunder challenging conditions.

Real stochastic processes\nexhibit a degree of memory effects (correlations in time), long-range\ndependencies, roughness and anomalous diffusion phenomena that are not captured\nin standard diffusion or bridge modeling due to the use of Brownian motion\n(BM). As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM),\nwe construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the\nnon-Markovian nature of fBM.
