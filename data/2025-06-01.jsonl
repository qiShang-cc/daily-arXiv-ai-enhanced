This paper extends our prior work on the Flexure-FET MC\nreceiver by integrating a competitive binding model to enhance performance in\nhigh-interference environments, where multiple molecular species coexist in the\nreception space. Previous studies have largely focused on ligand concentration\nestimation and detection, without fully addressing the effects of inter-species\ncompetition for receptor binding. Our proposed framework captures this\ncompetition, offering a more biologically accurate model for multitarget\nenvironments. By incorporating competition dynamics, the model improves\nunderstanding of MC behavior under interference. This approach enables\nfine-tuning of receptor responses by adjusting ligand concentrations and\nreceptor affinities, thereby optimizing the performance of the Flexure-FET MC\nreceiver. Comprehensive analysis shows that accounting for competitive binding\nis crucial for improving reliability and accuracy in complex MC systems.\nFactors such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), symbol error probability (SEP),\ninterferer concentration, and receptor dynamics are shown to significantly\naffect performance. The proposed framework highlights the need to manage these\nfactors effectively.
