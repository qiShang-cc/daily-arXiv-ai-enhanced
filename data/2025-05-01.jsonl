Achieving these goals\nnecessitates reforms in cellular networks, specifically in the physical layer\nand antenna design. The deployment of transmissive metasurfaces at basestations\n(BSs) presents an appealing solution, enabling beamforming in the radiated wave\ndomain, minimizing the need for energy-hungry RF chains. Among various\nmetasurface-based antenna designs, we propose using Huygens' metasurface-based\nantennas (HMAs) at BSs. Huygens' metasurfaces offer an attractive solution for\nantennas because, by utilizing Huygens' equivalence principle, they allow\nindependent control over both the amplitude and phase of the transmitted\nelectromagnetic wave. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits of\nHMAs in wireless networks by integrating electromagnetic theory and information\ntheory within a unified analytical framework. Specifically, we model the unique\nelectromagnetic characteristics of HMAs and incorporate them into an\ninformation-theoretic optimization framework to determine their maximum\nachievable sum rate. By formulating an optimization problem that captures the\nimpact of HMA's hardware constraints and electromagnetic properties, we\nquantify the channel capacity of HMA-assisted systems. We then compare the\nperformance of HMAs against phased arrays and other metasurface-based antennas\nin both rich scattering and realistic 3GPP channels, highlighting their\npotential in improving spectral and energy efficiency."}
