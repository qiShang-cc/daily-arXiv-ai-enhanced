We train sensorimotor policies to track the\npredictions of such a model, conditioned on a history of past robot states,\nwhile optimizing a relatively sparse task reward. This approach entirely\nbypasses gradient-based kinematic retargeting and adversarial losses, which\nlimit existing methods from fully leveraging the scale and diversity of modern\nhuman-scene interaction datasets. Empirically, we find that our approach can\nwork across robots and tasks, outperforming existing baselines by a large\nmargin.

Learning such behaviors directly on physical\nhardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints.\nExisting methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require\nmanually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting\nreal-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition\n(URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and\nmaster diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We\ndemonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a\nUnitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach\nsupports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.\nWe also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream\ntasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all\nbaselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios.\nOur results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that\nenables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention,\nrepresenting a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic\nsystems.

We have\ndeveloped a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans\nin situ based on \"core\" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents.\nThis is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered\ndevice. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are\nspawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an\nautonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel\ndiscretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local\nenvironment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward\ndepth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both\nempirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our\napproach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient\nmulti-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of\na reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional\ncase study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in\nthe context of autonomous vehicles."}

To address the challenges of\nautonomous manipulation (particularly kinematic uncertainties from variable\nmotion scaling and variation of the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) point), we\npropose AutoRing, an imitation learning framework for autonomous intraocular\nforeign body ring manipulation. Our approach integrates dynamic RCM calibration\nto resolve coordinate-system inconsistencies caused by intraocular instrument\nvariation and introduces the RCM-ACT architecture, which combines\naction-chunking transformers with real-time kinematic realignment. Trained\nsolely on stereo visual data and instrument kinematics from expert\ndemonstrations in a biomimetic eye model, AutoRing successfully completes ring\ngrasping and positioning tasks without explicit depth sensing. Experimental\nvalidation demonstrates end-to-end autonomy under uncalibrated microscopy\nconditions. The results provide a viable framework for developing intelligent\neye-surgical systems capable of complex intraocular procedures."}

This paper introduces a method that automatically\ngenerates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which\nregions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task\nperformance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex\ninterplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task\nrequirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region\nmodel resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning\nquery. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage\nprocess optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before\ndirectly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task,\nour method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task\nperformance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path\ntowards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally\nefficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks."}

Cognitive science\nsuggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived\nrepresentations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves\nverbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term\nmemory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a\nCognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A\npretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens\nthat form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores\nlow-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory\nretrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with\ncurrent tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these\ntokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware\naction sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks\nacross three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it\nachieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on\nBridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon\ntemporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon\ntasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

While deep learning has\nrevolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a\ncritical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively\nexpensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert\nsurveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental\nquestion: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without\nreal-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing\ntwo paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam\necho-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar\nsimulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art\nneural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that\nleverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry\nsurveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks\ntrained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated\nscenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.\nConversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data\nwithout requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic\nnoise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom\nabout data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work\nopens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine\narchaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments\nwhere traditional machine learning approaches fail."}

Performance Disparities in Underwater Object Detection", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "cs.RO"], "comment": "10 pages", "summary": "Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but\nposes unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class\ndistribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is\ndetected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key\nresearch questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific\nperformance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of\nunder-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the\nobject detection task into localization and classification and investigate the\nunder-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and\nTIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic\nstage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent\nprecision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based\nchallenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend\nimbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced\ndistributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes\nshould focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.\nWe publicly release our code and datasets."}

We derive those\npseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery\nusing Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation\nnetwork. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss\nfunction to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time\nthe training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.\nFurthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online\nmodel in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled\ncrowdsourced data.

This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with\nnon-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind\nAI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability\nwhile optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we\npropose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by\ngenerating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us\nto explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We\nconduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and\nvalidate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our\napproach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,\nyielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,\nnon-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA\nLeaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route\ncompletion rate, all while ensuring interpretability."}

Under fixed illumination conditions in static or\nlow-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any\nevents, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this\nlimitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that\noften requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,\nwe introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by\nemploying a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational\nmotion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the\ninjected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream\nperception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and\nevaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers\nmotion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection\nover event-based sensing without motion induction."}
