The channel when viewed in the DD domain is\npredictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically,\nalbeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication\nscheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot\ntransmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be\nused as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data\ncan enable further detection enabling the \"differential\" aspect of the\ncommunication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD\nchannel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data\nsymbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next\ninstant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it\nallows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would\notherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols.\nSecond, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded\npilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot\nscheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower\ncomplexity."}

However, in many papers neural\nnetworks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel\nor similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new\ndata which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training\nknowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be\ntime-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited\ncomputing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing\nresources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This\nmotivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform\nrobustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information\nbeing known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to\ngenerate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that\nafter training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error\n(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network\nsolutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for\nreal-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further\npropose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different\nchannel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks\nwith different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved\nappears to be independent of neural network architecture.
