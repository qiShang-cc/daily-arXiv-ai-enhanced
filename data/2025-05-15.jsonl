Regulatory agencies around the world are planning to mandate CPD\nsystems in the near future. However, existing solutions have limitations in\nterms of accuracy, coverage, and additional device requirements. While\nWiFi-based solutions can overcome the limitations, existing approaches struggle\nto reliably distinguish between adult and child presence, leading to frequent\nfalse alarms, and are often sensitive to environmental variations. In this\npaper, we present DeepCPD, a novel deep learning framework designed for\naccurate child presence detection in smart vehicles. DeepCPD utilizes an\nenvironment-independent feature-the auto-correlation function (ACF) derived\nfrom WiFi channel state information (CSI)-to capture human-related signatures\nwhile mitigating environmental distortions. A Transformer-based architecture,\nfollowed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP), is employed to differentiate adults\nfrom children by modeling motion patterns and subtle body size differences. To\naddress the limited availability of in-vehicle child and adult data, we\nintroduce a two-stage learning strategy that significantly enhances model\ngeneralization. Extensive experiments conducted across more than 25 car models\nand over 500 hours of data collection demonstrate that DeepCPD achieves an\noverall accuracy of 92.86%, outperforming a CNN baseline by a substantial\nmargin (79.55%). Additionally, the model attains a 91.45% detection rate for\nchildren while maintaining a low false alarm rate of 6.14%."}

This article investigates advanced\nmainlobe jamming suppression techniques utilizing a novel multiple-input\nmultiple-output space-time coding array (MIMO-STCA) radar. Extending the\ncapabilities of traditional MIMO radar, the MIMO-STCA framework introduces\nadditional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the range domain through the\nutilization of transmit time delays, offering enhanced resilience against\ninterference. One of the key challenges in mainlobe jamming scenarios is the\ndifficulty in obtaining interference-plus-noise samples that are free from\ntarget signal contamination. To address this, the study introduces a cumulative\nsampling-based non-homogeneous sample selection (CS-NHSS) algorithm to remove\ntarget-contaminated samples, ensuring accurate interference-plus-noise\ncovariance matrix estimation and effective noise subspace separation. Building\non this, the subsequent step is to apply the proposed noise subspace-based\njamming mitigation (NSJM) algorithm, which leverages the orthogonality between\nnoise and jamming subspace for effective jamming mitigation.

In ISAC systems, standard\ncommunication waveforms can be adapted for sensing, as the sensing receiver\n(co-located with the transmitter) has knowledge of the communication message\nand consequently the waveform. However, the randomness of communications may\nresult in waveforms that have high sidelobes masking weak targets. Thus, it is\ndesirable to refine communication waveforms to improve the sensing performance\nby reducing the integrated sidelobe levels (ISL). This is similar to the\npeak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) mitigation in orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM), in which the OFDM-modulated waveform needs to be refined\nto reduce the PAPR. In this paper, inspired by PAPR reduction algorithms in\nOFDM, we employ trellis shaping in OFDM-based ISAC systems to refine waveforms\nfor specific sensing metrics using convolutional codes and Viterbi decoding. In\nsuch a scheme, the communication data is encoded and then mapped to the\nsignaling constellation in different subcarriers, such that the time-domain\nsidelobes are reduced. An interesting observation is that sidelobe reduction in\nOFDM-based ISAC is dual to PAPR reduction in OFDM, thereby sharing a similar\nsignaling structure.

This also introduces spatial\nnon-stationarity (SnS), as different antenna elements observe distinct\nmultipath characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes a THz XL-MIMO channel\nmodel that accounts for both NF propagation and SnS, validated using channel\nmeasurement data. In this work, we first conduct THz XL-MIMO channel\nmeasurements at 100 GHz and 132 GHz using 301- and 531-element ULAs in indoor\nenvironments, revealing pronounced NF effects characterized by nonlinear\ninter-element phase variations, as well as element-dependent delay and angle\nshifts. Moreover, the SnS phenomenon is observed, arising not only from\nblockage but also from inconsistent reflection or scattering. Based on these\nobservations, a hybrid NF channel modeling approach combining the\nscatterer-excited point-source model and the specular reflection model is\nproposed to capture nonlinear phase variation. For SnS modeling, amplitude\nattenuation factors (AAFs) are introduced to characterize the continuous\nvariation of path power across the array.
