### [1] [Three-Dimensional Millimeter-Wave Imaging Using Active Incoherent Fourier Processing and Pulse Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07239)
*Jorge R. Colon-Berrios,Jason M. Merlo,Jeffrey A. Nanzer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合二维空间傅里叶域成像技术与传统雷达脉冲压缩的三维成像方法，通过噪声信号和线性调频脉冲的联合处理实现三维场景重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成像技术难以同时实现高分辨率的三维成像，需要一种新的方法以高效获取场景的横、纵方向信息。

Method: 使用四个发射器，其中三个发射空间和时间不相干的噪声信号，第四个发射已知的线性调频脉冲信号，通过干涉处理匹配滤波实现三维重构。

Result: 通过仿真和实验验证，成功重建了目标的三维图像。

Conclusion: 该方法在三维成像中表现出色，为复杂场景的高分辨率成像提供了新途径。

Abstract: We present a novel three-dimensional (3D) imaging approach that combines
two-dimensional spatial Fourier-domain imaging techniques with traditional
radar pulse compression to recover both cross-range and down-range scene
information. The imaging system employs four transmitters, three of which emit
spatially and temporally incoherent noise signals, while the fourth transmits a
known linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulsed signal. The spatial incoherence
of the noise signals enables sampling of the 2D spatial Fourier spectrum of the
scene from which two-dimensional cross-range (azimuth and elevation) images can
be formed via interferometric processing. Simultaneously, the LFM signal
enables high-resolution downrange imaging through matched filtering. The
received signals consist of a superposition of the noise sources and the known
pulse allowing for joint recovery of all three dimensions. We describe the
system architecture and waveform design, and demonstrate the imaging technique
using both simulations with a linear array and experimental data from a 38 GHz
active incoherent millimeter-wave imaging system with 23-element randomized
array. Results show the reconstruction of targets in three dimensions.

### [2] [A RIS-Enabled Computational Radar Coincidence Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07285)
*Kavian Zirak,Mohammadreza F. Imani*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合RIS、RCI和计算成像的创新成像方法，通过定向波束形成高信噪比和低杂波的图像，适用于多种场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算成像使用随机模式，信噪比低；而扫描成像需要大量测量。本文旨在结合两者的优势，提出一种高效且高质量的成像方法。

Method: 利用RIS定向波束形成空间多样的散斑模式，结合RCI和计算成像技术，通过少量测量即可重建高质量图像。

Result: 数值模拟表明该方法信噪比高、杂波少，且优于传统技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在安全筛查、无线用户跟踪和活动识别等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative imaging method using reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) by combining radar coincidence imaging (RCI) and
computational imaging techniques. In the proposed framework, RISs
simultaneously redirect beams toward a desired region of interest (ROI). The
interference of these beams forms spatially diverse speckle patterns that carry
information about the entire ROI. As a result, this method can take advantage
of the benefits of both random patterns and spotlight imaging. Since the
speckle pattern is formed by directive beams (instead of random patterns
typically used in computational imaging), this approach results in a higher
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced clutter. In contrast to raster
scanning, which requires the number of measurements to be at least equal to the
number of unknowns, our proposed approach follows a computational imaging
framework and can obtain high-quality images even when only a few measurements
are taken. Using numerical simulation, we demonstrate this method's
capabilities and contrast it against other conventional techniques. The
proposed imaging approach can be applied to security screening, wireless user
tracking, and activity recognition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于毫米波雷达的框架，提取人群运动模式并推断语义，通过信号处理和图形化分析实现高保真重建和语义推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在利用毫米波雷达技术解决人群运动模式分析和语义推断的问题，为人群分析提供新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd
motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our
proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts
from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to
generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations
of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these
fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow
currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is
quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian
and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd
semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on
crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity
mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the
underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating
strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow
split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key
crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift,
dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework,
underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

### [4] [Featureless Wireless Communications using Enhanced Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07474)
*Ruhui Zhang,Wei Lin,Binbin Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自动编码器（AE）的无线通信系统，通过改进损失函数和输入编码方式，生成具有低检测/拦截概率的特征信号，同时降低了误块率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信系统中，低检测/拦截概率（LPD/LPI）信号需求日益增长，而传统方法难以平衡信号隐蔽性和通信性能。

Method: 1. 在损失函数中增加KL散度项以增强信号的噪声特性；2. 使用二进制输入替换独热编码，并结合纠错编码提高长消息块的性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了信号的特征隐蔽性，并大幅降低了误块率（BLER）。

Conclusion: 所提出的AE框架为安全可靠的无线通信系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly autoencoders (AEs),
have gained significant attention in wireless communication systems. This paper
investigates using an AE to generate featureless signals with a low probability
of detection and interception (LPD/LPI). Firstly, we introduce a novel loss
function that adds a KL divergence term to the categorical cross entropy,
enhancing the noise like characteristics of AE-generated signals while
preserving block error rate (BLER). Secondly, to support long source message
blocks for the AE's inputs, we replace one-hot inputs of source blocks with
binary inputs pre-encoded by conventional error correction coding schemes. The
AE's outputs are then decoded back to the source blocks using the same scheme.
This design enables the AE to learn the coding structure, yielding superior
BLER performance on coded blocks and the BLER of the source blocks is further
decreased by the error correction decoder. Moreover, we also validate the AE
based communication system in the over-the-air communication. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the featureless
properties of AE signals and significantly reduce the BLER of message blocks,
underscoring the promise of our AE-based approach for secure and reliable
wireless communication systems.

### [5] [Leveraging Power Amplifier Distortion for Physical Layer Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07567)
*Reza Ghasemi Alavicheh,Thomas Feys,MD Arifur Rahman,François Rottenberg*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用功率放大器非线性失真的新方法，通过失真感知预编码增强物理层安全性，将失真引导至非用户位置以干扰潜在窃听者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理层安全技术通常通过注入与合法信道正交的人工噪声来增强安全性，而本文发现功率放大器的非线性特性（通常被认为是不良特性）可以被利用来提升安全性。

Method: 提出了Z3RO预编码器，通过在多个天线上应用负极性，消除用户位置的PA失真，并将失真引导至非用户位置，从而对潜在窃听者造成干扰。

Result: 数值模拟显示，在32 dB信噪比和-5 dB输入回退条件下，Z3RO预编码器的保密率比传统最大比传输预编码提高了2.5倍。

Conclusion: 研究表明，功率放大器的非线性特性可以用于提升物理层安全性能，为未来无线通信安全设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to physical layer security (PLS) by
leveraging power amplifier (PA) nonlinear distortion through distortion-aware
precoding. While some conventional PLS techniques inject artificial noise
orthogonal to legitimate channels, we demonstrate that inherent PA
nonlinearities typically considered undesirable can be exploited to enhance
security. The zero 3rd order (Z3RO) precoder applies a negative polarity to
several antennas to cancel the PA distortion at the user location, resulting in
distortion being transmitted in non-user locations. Redirecting the distortion
to non-user locations creates interference for potential eavesdroppers,
lowering their signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR). Numerical
simulations reveal that the Z3RO precoder achieves up to a $2.5\times$
improvement in secrecy rate compared to conventional maximum ratio transmission
(MRT) precoding under a $10\%$ outage probability, SNR of $32$ dB and $-5$ dB
input back-off (IBO) where the PAs enter the saturation regime.

### [6] [RIS-assisted ISAC Systems for Industrial Revolution 6.0: Exploring the Near-field and Far-field Coexistence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07643)
*Seonghoon Yoo,Jaemin Jung,Seongah Jeong,Jinkyu Kang,Markku Juntti,Joonhyuk Kang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了工业物联网(IIoT)中可重构智能表面(RIS)辅助的集成感知与通信(ISAC)系统，优化了频谱效率与感知精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现工业6.0需要无缝集成多样设备，ISAC对IIoT实时控制至关重要。

Method: 使用RIS辅助的ISAC系统，结合近场与远场区域，采用NOMA和SCA-AO算法优化RIS相位、带宽分配等。

Result: 提出方法在频谱效率和感知精度上显著优于传统方法，适用于多种RIS和设备配置。

Conclusion: RIS辅助的ISAC系统在近场和远场共存场景下表现优越，为IIoT提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has emerged as a key technology for
realizing the vision of Industry 6.0, requiring the seamless integration of
diverse connected devices. In particular, integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) plays a critical role in supporting real-time control and automation
within IIoT systems. In this paper, we explore reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted ISAC systems for IIoT in the coexistence of near-field
and far-field regions. The system consists of a full-duplex access point (AP),
a RIS and multiple IIoT devices, where the near-field devices simultaneously
perform sensing and communication, while the far-field devices rely on a
RIS-assisted communication. To enhance spectral efficiency for both sensing and
communication functionalities, we consider the use of both traditional
sensing-only (SO) and ISAC frequency bands. Moreover, uplink non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) is employed to facilitate the sequential decoding of
superimposed communication and sensing signals from IIoT devices. To maximize
sensing accuracy in terms of Cram${\Grave{\textrm{e}}}$r-Rao bound (CRB), we
formulate a joint optimization of RIS phase shift, bandwidth splitting ratio
and receive beamforming vector subject to the minimum data rate requirements of
IIoT devices and resource budget constraints. The algorithmic solution is
developed via the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based alternating
optimization (AO) method with the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms conventional methods relying solely on either ISAC or SO band by
achieving superior performance across RIS and device configurations, while
ensuring robust ISAC performance under the near-field and far-field coexistence
scenarios.

### [7] [Consistent and Asymptotically Efficient Localization from Bearing-only Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07647)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了仅基于方向测量的信号源定位问题，提出了一种两阶段估计器，该估计器具有与最大似然估计器相同的渐近性质，但计算复杂度更低。第一阶段通过线性最小二乘法获得一致估计器，第二阶段通过单次高斯-牛顿迭代实现高效估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信号源定位中最大似然估计器因非凸优化问题而难以计算的挑战，提出一种低复杂度且高效的替代方案。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在大样本量下表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段估计器在保持渐近高效性的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We study the problem of signal source localization using bearing-only
measurements. Initially, we present easily verifiable geometric conditions for
sensor deployment to ensure the asymptotic identifiability of the model and
demonstrate the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood
(ML) estimator. However, obtaining the ML estimator is challenging due to its
association with a non-convex optimization problem. To address this, we propose
a two-step estimator that shares the same asymptotic properties as the ML
estimator while offering low computational complexity, linear in the number of
measurements. The primary challenge lies in obtaining a preliminary consistent
estimator in the first step. To achieve this, we construct a linear
least-squares problem through algebraic operations on the measurement nonlinear
model to first obtain a biased closed-form solution. We then eliminate the bias
using the data to yield an asymptotically unbiased and consistent estimator.
The key to this process is obtaining a consistent estimator of the variance of
the sine of the noise by taking the reciprocal of the maximum eigenvalue of a
specially constructed matrix from the data. In the second step, we perform a
single Gauss-Newton iteration using the preliminary consistent estimator as the
initial value, achieving the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator.
Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed two-step estimator for large sample sizes.

Conclusion: LeFo方法通过准确的信号预测，有效解决了触觉互联网中的信号丢失和延迟问题，提升了系统的可靠性和稳健性。

Abstract: Tactile Internet (TI) requires achieving ultra-low latency and highly
reliable packet delivery for haptic signals. In the presence of packet loss and
delay, the signal prediction method provides a viable solution for recovering
the missing signals. To this end, we introduce the Leader-Follower (LeFo)
approach based on a cooperative Stackelberg game, which enables both users and
robots to learn and predict actions. With accurate prediction, the
teleoperation system can safely relax its strict delay requirements. Our method
achieves high prediction accuracy, ranging from 80.62% to 95.03% for remote
robot signals at the Human ($H$) side and from 70.44% to 89.77% for human
operation signals at the remote Robot ($R$) side. We also establish an upper
bound for maximum signal loss using Taylor Expansion, ensuring robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于恶劣的环境和缺乏基础设施，海上风电场的可靠低延迟通信仍具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种基于FBS的系统，开发了端到端延迟模型，并结合轨迹规划、波束成形和资源分配进行多目标优化。

Conclusion: FBS方法为海上风电场提供了高效的实时通信解决方案，适用于大规模部署。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable and low-latency communication in offshore wind farms is
critical for efficient monitoring and control, yet remains challenging due to
the harsh environment and lack of infrastructure. This paper investigates a
flying base station (FBS) approach for wide-area monitoring and control in the
UK Hornsea offshore wind farm project. By leveraging mobile, flexible FBS
platforms in the remote and harsh offshore environment, the proposed system
offers real-time connectivity for turbines without the need for deploying
permanent infrastructure at the sea. We develop a detailed and practical
end-to-end latency model accounting for five key factors: flight duration,
connection establishment, turbine state information upload, computational
delay, and control transmission, to provide a holistic perspective often
missing in prior studies. Furthermore, we combine trajectory planning,
beamforming, and resource allocation into a multi-objective optimization
framework for the overall latency minimization, specifically designed for
large-scale offshore wind farm deployments. Simulation results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed method in minimizing latency and enhancing
efficiency in FBS-assisted offshore monitoring across various power levels,
while consistently outperforming baseline designs.

*Dogan Kutay Pekcan,Hongyi Liao,Ender Ayanoglu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在具有相位依赖幅度（PDA）和离散相位偏移的RIS中最大化用户设备接收功率的算法，收敛速度快于穷举搜索，并引入量化框架和扩展算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RIS中离散相位偏移和幅度限制下的接收功率最大化问题。

Result: 分析表明，增加离散相位数超过4种增益有限，且性能对相位范围和幅度敏感。

Conclusion: 所提算法为RIS离散波束成形提供了通用上限基准。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the received power at a user
equipment via reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) characterized by
phase-dependent amplitude (PDA) and discrete phase shifts over a limited phase
range. Given complex RIS coefficients, that is, discrete phase shifts and PDAs,
we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the optimal
solution. To this end, we propose an optimal search algorithm that is proven to
converge in linear time within at most NK steps, significantly outperforming
the exhaustive search approach that would otherwise be needed for RISs with
amplitude attenuation. Furthermore, we introduce a practical quantization
framework for PDA-introduced RISs termed amplitude-introduced polar
quantization (APQ), and extend it to a novel algorithm named extended
amplitude-introduced polar quantization (EAPQ) that works with geometric
projections. We derive closed-form expressions to assess how closely the
performance of the proposed RIS configuration can approximate the ideal case
with continuous phases and no attenuation. Our analysis reveals that increasing
the number of discrete phases beyond K = 4 yields only marginal gains,
regardless of attenuation levels, provided the RIS has a sufficiently wide
phase range R. Furthermore, we also show and quantify that when the phase range
R is limited, the performance is sensitive to attenuation for larger R, and
sensitive to R when there is less attenuation. Finally, the proposed optimal
algorithm provides a generic upper bound that could serve as a benchmark for
discrete beamforming in RISs with amplitude constraints.

### [11] [Optimization of Probabilistic Constellation Shaping for Optical OFDM Systems with Clipping Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07507)
*Thanh V. Pham,Susumu Ishihara*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文研究了概率成形技术（PCS）与光OFDM结合对信号峰均比（PAPR）的影响，并提出了一种优化PCS的方法以最大化信道容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCS虽能提高频谱效率和适应性，但其与光OFDM结合可能增加信号PAPR，加剧由于信号削波引起的失真问题，需要优化以减少负面影响。

Method: 提出了一种基于投影梯度下降的次优但高效的求解方法，优化PCS以最大化信道容量，同时考虑削波失真。

Result: 模拟结果表明，所提出的方法在严重削波失真条件下优于传统的均匀信号传输方法。

Conclusion: 通过优化PCS，可以提高光无线通信系统的性能，尤其在信号削波严重的场景中。

Abstract: Optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and probabilistic
constellation shaping (PCS) have emerged as powerful techniques to enhance the
performance of optical wireless communications (OWC) systems. While PCS
improves spectral efficiency and adaptability, we show that its integration
with optical OFDM can inadvertently increase the peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) of the signal, exacerbating clipping distortion due to signal clipping.
This letter investigates the impact of PCS on the PAPR of direct current-biased
optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) waveforms and proposes an optimization of PCS that
maximizes channel capacity, considering clipping distortion. The optimization
problem is shown to be complex and non-convex. We thus present a suboptimal yet
efficient solving approach based on projected gradient descent to solve the
problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
approach over the conventional uniform signaling, particularly under severe
clipping distortion conditions.

Motivation: 传统语音增强方法需要针对每项任务进行调整，难以泛化到未知下游任务。本研究旨在构建一个通用的语音增强前端，提升后端处理多种任务的能力。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在保持增强信号感知质量的同时，提升了多种语音任务的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功构建了一个通用的语音增强前端，能够有效支持多种下游任务，且保留了语音的高层次信息。

Abstract: Single-channel speech enhancement is utilized in various tasks to mitigate
the effect of interfering signals. Conventionally, to ensure the speech
enhancement performs optimally, the speech enhancement has needed to be tuned
for each task. Thus, generalizing speech enhancement models to unknown
downstream tasks has been challenging. This study aims to construct a generic
speech enhancement front-end that can improve the performance of back-ends to
solve multiple downstream tasks. To this end, we propose a novel training
criterion that minimizes the distance between the enhanced and the ground truth
clean signal in the feature representation domain of self-supervised learning
models. Since self-supervised learning feature representations effectively
express high-level speech information useful for solving various downstream
tasks, the proposal is expected to make speech enhancement models preserve such
information. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposal improves
the performance of multiple speech tasks while maintaining the perceptual
quality of the enhanced signal.

Conclusion: 该研究首次展示了结合IMU和雷达数据的鲁棒多模态学习框架，有效提升了食物摄入动作检测的准确性。

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAD是一种基于在线去相关学习的实时异常检测方法，适用于高维流式数据，具有单次处理和低内存消耗的特点，性能优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工业物联网的兴起，处理高维多变量传感器数据的实时异常检测需求激增，传统方法无法满足单次处理和低内存消耗的要求。

Method: DAD采用动态去相关学习，逐样本监控数据相关性结构，无需存储历史数据，并引入了针对实时场景的超参数调优策略。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上，DAD在多种异常类型上表现一致且优于现有方法，尤其是在高维数据流中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果和计算效率之间达到了最优平衡，为实时、内存受限的异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决RIS辅助无线网络中SEE最大化的问题，比较主动和近被动RIS的性能差异。

Method: 作者开发了两种SEE最大化算法，优化移动用户的发射功率、RIS反射系数和基站接收滤波器，并考虑了完美和统计信道状态信息。

Result: 数值结果表明，主动RIS的SEE表现较差，尤其是随着每个反射元件的静态功耗增加。

Conclusion: 主动和近被动RIS在SEE表现上存在明显权衡，需根据实际需求选择合适的RIS类型。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of secrecy energy efficiency (SEE)
maximization in RIS-aided wireless networks. The use of active and
nearly-passive RISs are compared and their trade-off in terms of SEE is
analyzed. Considering both perfect and statistical channel state information,
two SEE maximization algorithms are developed to optimize the transmit powers
of the mobile users, the RIS reflection coefficients, and the base station
receive filters. Numerical results quantify the trade-off between active and
nearly-passive RISs in terms of SEE, with active RISs yielding worse SEE values
as the static power consumed by each reflecting element increases.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多元代数结构和信号处理方法的加密/解密新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合多元代数技术和信号处理，实现更安全高效的信息传输。

Method: 利用整数幅度信号发送信息，并通过多元技术将明文转换为特殊整数序列，接收方通过特定规则和方程组恢复明文。

Result: 该方法提供了一种新颖的加密/解密机制。

Conclusion: 该研究为信息安全领域提供了新的技术思路。

Abstract: A novel original procedure of encryption/decryption based on the polyadic
algebraic structures and on signal processing methods is proposed. First, we
use signals with integer amplitudes to send information. Then we use polyadic
techniques to transfer the plaintext into series of special integers. The
receiver restores the plaintext using special rules and systems of equations.
