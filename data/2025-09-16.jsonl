The rise of Large Foundation Models\n(LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction.

However, domain gaps\nacross visual, morphological, and physical aspects hinder direct imitation. To\neffectively bridge the domain gap, we propose ImMimic, an embodiment-agnostic\nco-training framework that leverages both human videos and a small amount of\nteleoperated robot demonstrations. ImMimic uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with\neither action- or visual-based mapping to map retargeted human hand poses to\nrobot joints, followed by MixUp interpolation between paired human and robot\ntrajectories. Our key insights are (1) retargeted human hand trajectories\nprovide informative action labels, and (2) interpolation over the mapped data\ncreates intermediate domains that facilitate smooth domain adaptation during\nco-training. Evaluations on four real-world manipulation tasks (Pick and Place,\nPush, Hammer, Flip) across four robotic embodiments (Robotiq, Fin Ray, Allegro,\nAbility) show that ImMimic improves task success rates and execution\nsmoothness, highlighting its efficacy to bridge the domain gap for robust robot\nmanipulation.

Nevertheless, its deployment on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\nremains challenging, mainly because of reliance on accurate dynamic models and\nplatform-specific sensing, which hinders cross-platform transfer. This paper\npresents the CORB-Planner (Corridor-as-Observations for RL B-spline planner), a\nreal-time, RL-based trajectory planning framework for high-speed autonomous UAV\nflight across heterogeneous platforms. The key idea is to combine B-spline\ntrajectory generation with the RL policy producing successive control points\nwith a compact safe flight corridor (SFC) representation obtained via heuristic\nsearch. The SFC abstracts obstacle information in a low-dimensional form,\nmitigating overfitting to platform-specific details and reducing sensitivity to\nmodel inaccuracies. To narrow the sim-to-real gap, we adopt an easy-to-hard\nprogressive training pipeline in simulation. A value-based soft\ndecomposed-critic Q (SDCQ) algorithm is used to learn effective policies within\napproximately ten minutes of training. Benchmarks in simulation and real-world\ntests demonstrate real-time planning on lightweight onboard hardware and\nsupport maximum flight speeds up to 8.2m/s in dense, cluttered environments\nwithout external positioning. Compatibility with various UAV configurations\n(quadrotors, hexarotors) and modest onboard compute underlines the generality\nand robustness of CORB-Planner for practical deployment."}

In an ISAC system, communications and\nsensing functionalities are jointly performed using the same waveform,\nfrequency band and hardware, thereby enabling various use cases such as in\ncyber physical systems, digital twin and smart cities. A major challenge to the\ndesign and analysis of ISAC is a unified framework that incorporates the two\ndistinct functions. By viewing ISAC as a type of broadcast channel, in this\npaper, we propose a unified ISAC framework in which communication and sensing\nsignals are broadcast to the actual communication users and virtual sensing\nusers. This framework allows the application of existing multiplexing schemes,\nsuch as dirty paper coding (DPC) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM) that\nhave been intensively studied in data communications and information theory.\nWithin this framework, we propose different superposition coding schemes, for\ncases when the sensing waveform is known or unknown to the communication\nreceiver.
