It is important for tasks such as\nspectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent\nyears, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC. However,\nmainstream methods still face two key problems. First, they often use\ntime-frequency images instead of raw signals. This causes loss of key\nmodulation features and reduces adaptability to different communication\nconditions. Second, most methods rely on supervised learning. This needs a\nlarge amount of labeled data, which is hard to get in real-world environments.\nTo solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called\nRIS-MAE. RIS-MAE uses masked autoencoders to learn signal features from\nunlabeled data. It takes raw IQ sequences as input. By applying random masking\nand reconstruction, it captures important time-domain features such as\namplitude, phase, etc. This helps the model learn useful and transferable\nrepresentations. RIS-MAE is tested on four datasets. The results show that it\nperforms better than existing methods in few-shot and cross-domain tasks.\nNotably, it achieves high classification accuracy on previously unseen datasets\nwith only a small number of fine-tuning samples, confirming its generalization\nability and potential for real-world deployment."}
