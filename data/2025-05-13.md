### [1] [Pinching-Antenna Assisted Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06240)
*Yixuan Li,Ji Wang,Yuanwei Liu,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

Result: 数值结果表明，PASS辅助的SWIPT相比传统系统显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的系统和方法在无线信息和能量同时传输中展现出优越性能，验证了其有效性和潜力。

Abstract: This letter introduces a novel pinching-antenna-system (PASS) assisted
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where multiple
pinching antennas (PAs) are strategically activiated on a waveguide to
facilitate information transmission to multiple information receivers (IRs) and
power transfer to multiple energy receivers (ERs) simultaneously. Leveraging
the single-waveguide architecture, non-orthogonal multiple access is employed
to enable the superposed transmission of information signals, eliminating the
need for dedicated energy carriers by concurrently serving both the IRs and the
ERs. In this letter, an optimization problem is first formulated with an
objective is to maximize the sum power received at the ERs via joint optimizing
the IRs power allocation and the PAs positioning. Given the challenging
non-convex nature of the formulated optimization problem, it is decoupled into
two sub-problems which are solved alternatively. Specifically, the power
allocation subproblem is recast a convex optimization problem, and hence can be
solved efficiently. Furthermore, we propose a high-precision element-wise
algorithm and a low-complexity linearly decreasing weight particle swarm
optimization algorithm to solve the position optimization sub-problem. The
numerical results demonstrate that PAs assisted SWIPT can achieve a remarkable
performance gain compared to conventional system.

Conclusion: SpectrumFM为频谱管理建立了新范式，显著提升了性能指标，展现了强大的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Intelligent spectrum management is crucial for improving spectrum efficiency
and achieving secure utilization of spectrum resources. However, existing
intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models,
suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and
generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation
model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management.
SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically
exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention
mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation
learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning
tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which
leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive
and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various
downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation
classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum
sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness,
adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently
outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically,
SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%,
achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of human health and comfort calls for adaptive systems
that respond to individual physiological needs in real time. This paper
presents an AI-enhanced digital twin framework that integrates biometric
signals, specifically electrocardiogram (ECG) data, with environmental
parameters such as temperature, humidity, and ventilation. Leveraging
IoT-enabled sensors and biometric monitoring devices, the system continuously
acquires, synchronises, and preprocesses multimodal data streams to construct a
responsive virtual replica of the physical environment. To validate this
framework, a detailed case study is conducted using the MIT-BIH noise stress
test dataset. ECG signals are filtered and segmented using dynamic sliding
windows, followed by extracting heart rate variability (HRV) features such as
SDNN, BPM, QTc, and LF/HF ratio. Relative deviation metrics are computed
against clean baselines to quantify stress responses. A random forest
classifier is trained to predict stress levels across five categories, and
Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to interpret model behaviour and
identify key contributing features. These predictions are mapped to a
structured set of environmental interventions using a Five Level Stress
Intervention Mapping, which activates multi-scale responses across personal,
room, building, and landscape levels. This integration of physiological
insight, explainable AI, and adaptive control establishes a new paradigm for
health-responsive built environments. It lays the foundation for the future
development of intelligent, personalised healing spaces.

### [9] [Terahertz Spatial Wireless Channel Modeling with Radio Radiance Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06277)
*John Song,Lihao Zhang,Feng Ye,Haijian Sun*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了在太赫兹（THz）频段应用无线电辐射场（RRF）框架的可行性，通过视觉几何和稀疏THz测量重建连续RRF，实现了高效空间信道状态信息（Spatial-CSI）建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: THz通信在6G系统中至关重要，但其信号传播特性与低频段差异显著，传统信道建模和估计方法效率低下，亟需新方法。

Method: 采用RRF框架，结合视觉几何和稀疏THz测量，重建连续RRF，并通过模拟THz场景验证性能。

Result: RRF能通过稀疏样本捕捉关键传播路径，验证了THz频段RRF建模的有效性。

Conclusion: RRF为未来6G网络提供了可扩展、低成本的空间信道重建方向。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is a key enabler for 6G systems, offering
ultra-wide bandwidth and unprecedented data rates. However, THz signal
propagation differs significantly from lower-frequency bands due to severe free
space path loss, minimal diffraction and specular reflection, and prominent
scattering, making conventional channel modeling and pilot-based estimation
approaches inefficient. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of
applying radio radiance field (RRF) framework to the THz band. This method
reconstructs a continuous RRF using visual-based geometry and sparse THz RF
measurements, enabling efficient spatial channel state information
(Spatial-CSI) modeling without dense sampling. We first build a fine simulated
THz scenario, then we reconstruct the RRF and evaluate the performance in terms
of both reconstruction quality and effectiveness in THz communication, showing
that the reconstructed RRF captures key propagation paths with sparse training
samples. Our findings demonstrate that RRF modeling remains effective in the
THz regime and provides a promising direction for scalable, low-cost spatial
channel reconstruction in future 6G networks.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为FEMSN的新型CNN模型，专注于在复杂工况下增强轴承故障特征的提取，通过FADEL去噪层和MSTFF模块提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂工况下难以提取显著的故障特征，因为噪声干扰掩盖了周期性冲击特征。

Method: 提出了FEMSN模型，包含FADEL去噪层、MSTFF多尺度时频融合模块和扩展感受野的蒸馏层。

Result: 通过两个案例研究验证了FEMSN和FADEL在机器健康监测中的有效性。

Conclusion: FEMSN模型显著提升了故障特征提取的鲁棒性和非线性表示能力。

Abstract: Rolling bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, and their
proper functioning is essential for industrial production. Most existing
condition monitoring methods focus on extracting discriminative features from
time-domain signals to assess bearing health status. However, under complex
operating conditions, periodic impulsive characteristics related to fault
information are often obscured by noise interference. Consequently, existing
approaches struggle to learn distinctive fault-related features in such
scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel CNN-based model
named FEMSN. Specifically, a Fourier Adaptive Denoising Encoder Layer (FADEL)
is introduced as an input denoising layer to enhance key features while
filtering out irrelevant information. Subsequently, a Multiscale Time-Frequency
Fusion (MSTFF) module is employed to extract fused time-frequency features,
further improving the model robustness and nonlinear representation capability.
Additionally, a distillation layer is incorporated to expand the receptive
field. Based on these advancements, a novel deep lightweight CNN model, termed
the Frequency-Enhanced Multiscale Network (FEMSN), is developed. The
effectiveness of FEMSN and FADEL in machine health monitoring and stability
assessment is validated through two case studies.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: ALFEE框架是一种新型混合变压器架构，针对EEG信号表示学习提出了两阶段学习策略，通过分离通道和时间特征建模，解决了现有模型的泛化问题，并在多个下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号在神经科学研究中具有高时间分辨率、操作实用性和安全性，但由于信噪比低、受试者间差异和跨范式差异，现有模型的泛化能力受限。现有方法简化策略导致领域差距，ALFEE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ALFEE采用混合注意力机制，分离通道和时间特征建模，包含通道编码器、时间编码器和混合解码器。预训练阶段优化多任务目标，微调阶段通过任务特定标记字典和跨注意力层提升性能。

Result: 经过25,000小时预训练，ALFEE在六个下游EEG任务中表现优于现有模型，证明了其鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: ALFEE为生物信号分析建立了可扩展的基础框架，为EEG信号处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While foundation models excel in text, image, and video domains, the critical
biological signals, particularly electroencephalography(EEG), remain
underexplored. EEG benefits neurological research with its high temporal
resolution, operational practicality, and safety profile. However, low
signal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and cross-paradigm
differences hinder the generalization of current models. Existing methods often
employ simplified strategies, such as a single loss function or a
channel-temporal joint representation module, and suffer from a domain gap
between pretraining and evaluation tasks that compromises efficiency and
adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Large
Foundation model for EEG signal representation(ALFEE) framework, a novel hybrid
transformer architecture with two learning stages for robust EEG representation
learning. ALFEE employs a hybrid attention that separates channel-wise feature
aggregation from temporal dynamics modeling, enabling robust EEG representation
with variable channel configurations. A channel encoder adaptively compresses
variable channel information, a temporal encoder captures task-guided
evolution, and a hybrid decoder reconstructs signals in both temporal and
frequency domains. During pretraining, ALFEE optimizes task prediction, channel
and temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting to enhance
multi-scale and multi-channel representation. During fine-tuning, a full-model
adaptation with a task-specific token dictionary and a cross-attention layer
boosts performance across multiple tasks. After 25,000 hours of pretraining,
extensive experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the
superior performance of ALFEE over existing models. Our ALFEE framework
establishes a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis with
implementation at https://github.com/xw1216/ALFEE.

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) offers critical cardiovascular insights, such as
identifying arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia, but enabling automated systems
to answer complex clinical questions directly from ECG signals (ECG-QA) remains
a significant challenge. Current approaches often lack robust multimodal
reasoning capabilities or rely on generic architectures ill-suited for the
nuances of physiological signals. We introduce Q-Heart, a novel multimodal
framework designed to bridge this gap. Q-Heart leverages a powerful, adapted
ECG encoder and integrates its representations with textual information via a
specialized ECG-aware transformer-based mapping layer. Furthermore, Q-Heart
leverages dynamic prompting and retrieval of relevant historical clinical
reports to guide tuning the language model toward knowledge-aware ECG
reasoning. Extensive evaluations on the benchmark ECG-QA dataset show Q-Heart
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a 4%
improvement in exact match accuracy. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of
combining domain-specific architectural adaptations with knowledge-augmented
LLM instruction tuning for complex physiological ECG analysis, paving the way
for more capable and potentially interpretable clinical patient care systems.

Result: 电池模拟器显示，该方法将内阻估计误差降低了30%-250%。在圆柱形锂离子电池的HPPC测试中，内阻高估值减少高达20mΩ。

Conclusion: 该方法通过捕捉OCV动态变化显著提升了内阻估计精度，且具有普适性，适用于不同电池类型和工况。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of resistance estimation in electronic
systems including battery management systems (BMS) and battery chargers. In
typical applications, the battery resistance is obtained through an approximate
method computed as the ratio of the voltage difference to the applied current
excitation pulse or vice versa for admittance. When estimating the battery
resistance, this approach ignores the change in the open circuit voltage (OCV)
as a result of the excitation signal. In this paper, we formally demonstrate
and quantify the effect of the OCV drop on the errors in internal resistance
estimation. Then, we propose a novel method to accurately estimate the internal
resistance by accounting for the change in OCV caused by the applied current
excitation signal. The proposed approach is based on a novel observation model
that allows one to estimate the effect of OCV without requiring any additional
information, such as the state of charge (SOC), parameters of the OCV-SOC
curve, and the battery capacity. As such, the proposed approach is independent
of the battery chemistry, size, age, and the ambient temperature. A performance
analysis of the proposed approach using the battery simulator shows significant
performance gain in the range of 30% to more than 250% in percentage estimation
error. Then, the proposed approach is applied for resistance estimation during
the hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) of cylindrical Li-ion battery
cells. Results from tested batteries show that the proposed approach reduced
the overestimated internal resistance of the batteries by up to 20 m{\Omega}.

Abstract: The monopulse technique is characterized by its high accuracy in angle
estimation and simplicity in engineering implementation. However, in the
complex electromagnetic environment, the presence of the mainlobe jamming (MLJ)
greatly degrades the accuracy of angle estimation. Conventional methods of
jamming suppression often lead to significant deviations in monopulse ratio
while suppressing MLJ. Additionally, the monopulse technique based on
traditional radar cannot jointly estimate the target's range. In this paper,
the four-channel adaptive beamforming (ABF) algorithm is proposed, which adds a
delta-delta channel based on conventional sum-difference-difference
three-channel to suppress a single MLJ. Moreover, considering the suppression
of multiple MLJs and sidelobe jammings (SLJs), the row-column ABF algorithm is
proposed. This algorithm utilizes more spatial degrees of freedom (DOFs) to
suppress multiple jammings by the row-column adaptive beamforming at the
subarray level. The key ideal of both algorithms is to suppress MLJ with null
along one spatial direction while keeping the sum and difference beampatterns
undistorted along another spatial direction. Therefore, the monopulse ratio
remains undistorted while suppressing the MLJ, ensuring the accuracy of
monopulse parameter estimation. Furthermore, by utilizing the additional
degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the range domain provided by the multiple-input
multiple-output space-time coding array (MIMO-STCA) radar, joint angle-range
estimation can be achieved through the monopulse technique. Simulation results
highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods in suppressing multiple
MLJs and enhancing the accuracy of monopulse parameter estimation, as verified
by the low root mean square error (RMSE) in the parameter estimation results.

Abstract: Implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) are evolving to record from
thousands of neurons wirelessly but face challenges in data bandwidth, power
consumption, and implant size. We propose a novel Spiking Neural Network Spike
Detector (SNN-SPD) that processes event-based neural data generated via delta
modulation and pulse count modulation, converting signals into sparse events.
By leveraging the temporal dynamics and inherent sparsity of spiking neural
networks, our method improves spike detection performance while maintaining low
computational overhead suitable for implantable devices. Our experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed SNN-SPD achieves an accuracy of 95.72% at
high noise levels (standard deviation 0.2), which is about 2% higher than the
existing Artificial Neural Network Spike Detector (ANN-SPD). Moreover, SNN-SPD
requires only 0.41% of the computation and about 26.62% of the weight
parameters compared to ANN-SPD, with zero multiplications. This approach
balances efficiency and performance, enabling effective data compression and
power savings for next-generation iBMIs.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a significant technology in wireless sensing and
Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), offering benefits such as low
cost, high penetration, and enhanced privacy. Currently, it is widely utilized
in various applications, including action recognition, human localization, and
crowd counting. However, Wi-Fi sensing also faces challenges, such as low
robustness and difficulties in data collection. Recently, there has been an
increasing focus on multi-modal Wi-Fi sensing, where other modalities can act
as teachers, providing ground truth or robust features for Wi-Fi sensing models
to learn from, or can be directly fused with Wi-Fi for enhanced sensing
capabilities. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results and
substantial value in practical applications, there is a lack of comprehensive
surveys reviewing them. To address this gap, this paper reviews the multi-modal
Wi-Fi sensing literature \textbf{from the past 24 months} and highlights the
current limitations, challenges and future directions in this field.

*Jia-Hui Bi,Shaoshi Yang,Xiao-Yang Wang,Yu-Song Luo,Sheng Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种动态时分双工（D-TDD）系统中的跨链路干扰（CLI）缓解方案，通过无线终端的空中转发下行导频信息及专用信道估计方法，避免了基站间回程链路的信息共享，显著提升了信号检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态时分双工系统虽能提高频谱效率，但相邻小区因传输方向不同会产生强跨链路干扰（CLI）。传统缓解方案依赖基站间回程链路共享信息，成本高且延迟大。

Method: 提出基于空中转发的下行导频共享方案，利用无线终端转发干扰基站的导频信息至受干扰基站，并设计专用CLI信道估计方法以减少误差。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方案使经典干扰抑制合并（IRC）接收器的性能接近完美导频信息时的水平，且无需回程链路信息共享。CLI信道估计进一步提升了信号检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方案有效解决了D-TDD系统的CLI问题，降低了实现复杂度，为未来移动通信系统提供了实用化干扰管理思路。

Abstract: Dynamic time-division duplex (D-TDD) aided mobile communication systems bear
the potential to achieve significantly higher spectral efficiency than
traditional static TDD based systems. However, strong cross-link interference
(CLI) may be caused by different transmission directions between adjacent cells
in D-TDD systems, thus degrading the performance. Most existing CLI mitigation
schemes require sharing certain information among base stations (BSs) via
backhaul links. This strategy is usually expensive and suffers high latency.
Alternatively, we propose a pilot information sharing scheme based on
over-the-air forwarding of the downlink pilot of the interfering BS to the
interfered BS via a wireless terminal, along with a dedicated CLI channel
estimation method. Simulation results demonstrate that thanks to the proposed
pilot information sharing scheme the classic interference rejection combining
(IRC) receiver achieves a signal detection performance highly comparable to
that of the IRC detector with perfect pilot information, necessitating no
information sharing among BSs via backhaul links. Furthermore, the proposed CLI
channel estimation scheme reduces the impact of errors introduced by pilot
forwarding, thereby improving the performance of both CLI channel estimation
and signal detection.

collected as part of the Find A Rover (AFAR) Challenge, organized by the NSF
Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless (AERPAW)
testbed and hosted at the Lake Wheeler Field in Raleigh, North Carolina. The
AFAR Challenge was a competition involving five finalist university teams,
focused on promoting innovation in UAV-assisted radio frequency (RF) source
localization. Participating teams were tasked with designing UAV flight
trajectories and localization algorithms to detect the position of a hidden
unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), also referred to as a rover, emitting wireless
probe signals generated by GNU Radio. The competition was structured to
evaluate solutions in a DT environment first, followed by deployment and
testing in AERPAW's outdoor wireless testbed. For each team, the UGV was placed
at three different positions, resulting in a total of 30 datasets, 15 collected
in a DT simulation environment and 15 in a physical outdoor testbed. Each
dataset contains time-synchronized measurements of received signal strength
(RSS), received signal quality (RSQ), GPS coordinates, UAV velocity, and UAV
orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw). Data is organized into structured folders
by team, environment (DT and real-world), and UGV location. The dataset
supports research in UAV-assisted RF source localization, air-to-ground (A2G)
wireless propagation modeling, trajectory optimization, signal prediction,
autonomous navigation, and DT validation. With approximately 300k
time-synchronized samples collected from real-world experiments, the dataset
provides a substantial foundation for training and evaluating deep learning

Motivation: XL-MIMO系统在近场通信中表现出显著的近场效应，需要一种能够高效估计稀疏信道的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为XL-MIMO系统的信道估计提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the near-field (NF) channel estimation (CE) for
extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems.
Considering the pronounced NF effects in XL-MIMO communications, we first
establish a joint angle-distance (AD) domain-based spherical-wavefront physical
channel model that captures the inherent sparsity of XL-MIMO channels.
Leveraging the channel's sparsity in the joint AD domain, the CE is approached
as a task of reconstructing sparse signals. Anchored in this framework, we
first propose a compressed sensing algorithm to acquire a preliminary channel
estimate. Harnessing the powerful implicit prior learning capability of
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), we further propose a GenAI-based
approach to refine the estimated channel. Specifically, we introduce the
preliminary estimated channel as side information, and derive the evidence
lower bound (ELBO) of the log-marginal distribution of the target NF channel
conditioned on the preliminary estimated channel, which serves as the
optimization objective for the proposed generative diffusion model (GDM).
Additionally, we introduce a more generalized version of the GDM, the
non-Markovian GDM (NM-GDM), to accelerate the sampling process, achieving an
approximately tenfold enhancement in sampling efficiency. Experimental results
indicate that the proposed approach is capable of offering substantial
performance gain in CE compared to existing benchmark schemes within NF XL-MIMO
systems. Furthermore, our approach exhibits enhanced generalization
capabilities in both the NF or far-field (FF) regions.

Motivation: 由于现有的确定性建模方法（如射线追踪）缺乏一个统一的RIS信道模型来支持所有RIS类型，本文旨在填补这一空白，为不同RIS类型的设计和比较提供理论基础。

Conclusion: 本工作为RIS赋能的无线通信系统的评估和优化提供了有力工具，特别是在多类型RIS和极化控制的场景中展现了其潜力。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technologies have been considered as
a promising enabler for 6G, enabling advantageous control of electromagnetic
(EM) propagation. RIS can be categorized into multiple types based on their
reflective/transmissive modes and polarization control capabilities, all of
which are expected to be widely deployed in practical environments. A reliable
RIS channel model is essential for the design and development of RIS
communication systems. While deterministic modeling approaches such as
ray-tracing (RT) offer significant benefits, a unified model that accommodates
all RIS types is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap by developing a
high-precision deterministic channel model based on RT, supporting multiple RIS
types: reflective, transmissive, hybrid, and three polarization operation
modes. To achieve this, a unified EM response model for the aforementioned RIS
types is developed. The reflection and transmission coefficients of RIS
elements are derived using a tensor-based equivalent impedance approach,
followed by calculating the scattered fields of the RIS to establish an EM
response model. The performance of different RIS types is compared through
simulations in typical scenarios. During this process, passive and lossless
constraints on the reflection and transmission coefficients are incorporated to
ensure fairness in the performance evaluation. Simulation results validate the
framework's accuracy in characterizing the RIS channel, and specific cases
tailored for dual-polarization independent control and polarization rotating
RISs are highlighted as insights for their future deployment. This work can be
helpful for the evaluation and optimization of RIS-enabled wireless
communication systems.

Result: 仿真显示优化间距后，焦点能量分布均匀且位置精度高，适用于不同极化的偶极天线和贴片天线。

Conclusion: 优化稀疏阵列设计能有效解决焦点偏移问题，提升近场波束聚焦性能。

Abstract: In near-field beam focusing for finite-sized arrays, focal shift is a
non-negligible issue. The actual focal point often appears closer to the array
than the predefined focal distance, significantly degrading the focusing
performance of finite aperture arrays. Moreover, when the focus point is
scanned across different locations, the degradation becomes even more
pronounced, leading not only to positional deviation but also to substantial
energy loss. To address this issue, we revisit the problem from the perspective
of communication degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that a properly designed
sparse array with optimized element spacing can effectively mitigate focal
shift while enabling stable control of the focusing height during beam
scanning. Simulation results based on dipole antennas with different
polarizations and patch antennas validate our findings. Notably, with optimized
inter-element distances, the energy distribution across focal points becomes
nearly uniform, and highly accurate focusing positions are achieved.

Abstract: Swarm antenna arrays, composed of spatially distributed antennas mounted on
unmanned agents, offer unprecedented flexibility and adaptability for wireless
sensing and communication. However, their reconfigurable architecture,
susceptibility to collisions, and inherently stochastic nature present
significant challenges to realizing collaborative gain. It remains unclear how
spatial coordination, positional perturbations, and large-scale topological
configurations affect coherent signal aggregation and overall system
performance. This paper investigates the feasibility of achieving coherent
beamforming in such systems from both deterministic and stochastic
perspectives. First, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework that
characterizes the necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of
grating lobes in multiple linear configurations. Notably, we show that for dual
linear arrays, the classical half-wavelength spacing constraint can be safely
relaxed without introducing spatial aliasing. This result challenges
traditional array design principles and enables more flexible, collision-aware
topologies. Second, we present a theoretical analysis, supported by empirical
validation, demonstrating that coherent gain can be approximately preserved
under realistic positional perturbations. Our results reveal that spatial
perturbations introduce measurable degradation in the main lobe, an effect that
cannot be mitigated merely by increasing the number of antennas. Instead, the
primary benefit of scaling lies in reducing the variance of
perturbation-induced fluctuations.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了大像素划分带来的误差问题，为ISAC系统的设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: One of the key points in designing an integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) system using computational imaging is the division size of imaging
pixels. If the size is too small, it leads to a high number of pixels that need
processing. On the contrary, it usually causes large processing errors since
each pixel is no longer uniformly coherent. In this paper, a novel method is
proposed to address such a problem in environment sensing in millimeter-wave
wireless cellular networks, which effectively cancels the severe errors caused
by large pixel division as in conventional computational imaging algorithms. To
this end, a novel computational imaging model in an integral form is
introduced, which leverages the continuous characteristics of object surfaces
in the environment and takes into account the different phases associated with
the different parts of the pixel. The proposed algorithm extends computational
imaging to large wireless communication scenarios for the first time. The
performance of the proposed method is then analyzed, and extensive numerical
results verify its effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper deals with the design of non-coherent jamming strategies capable
of ensuring spectral compatibility with friendly radio frequency (RF) emitters.
The goal is achieved via a cognitive approach, which, after recognizing the
presence of friendly RF systems within the bandwidth of interest (perception),
synthesizes a jamming waveform (action) with spectral notches, that allows to
interfere exclusively with opposite emissions. Two methods are proposed for the
synthesis of the jamming signal. The former leverages optimization techniques
for quadratically constrained quadratic problems (QCQP) where each constraint
embeds the interference level tolerable by a specific friendly RF system. The
latter is a very computationally efficient approach based on simple
projections, allowing a control over the spectral notch positions and widths.
At the analysis stage, the performance of the devised jamming techniques is
firstly numerically analyzed in terms of spectral occupancy and autocorrelation
characteristics. The impact of the quantization process involved in the
digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) of the jamming waveforms is also examined,
with a particular focus on the spectral shaping impairments resulting from
reduced DAC resolution. Finally, waveform transmission and reception is
experimentally assessed with software defined radio (SDR) devices.

Abstract: The increasing computational demand of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
necessitates energy-efficient acceleration strategies. Compute-in-Memory (CIM)
architectures based on Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) offer a promising
solution by reducing data movement and enabling low-power in-situ computations.
However, their efficiency is limited by the high cost of peripheral circuits,
particularly Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Large crossbars and low ADC
resolutions are often used to mitigate this, potentially compromising accuracy.
This work introduces novel simulation methods to model the impact of resistive
wire parasitics and limited ADC resolution on RRAM crossbars. Our parasitics
model employs a vectorised algorithm to compute crossbar output currents with
errors below 0.15% compared to SPICE. Additionally, we propose a variable
step-size ADC and a calibration methodology that significantly reduces ADC
resolution requirements. These accuracy models are integrated with a
statistics-based energy model. Using our framework, we conduct a comparative
analysis of binary and ternary CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the
ternary CNNs exhibit greater resilience to wire parasitics and lower ADC
resolution but suffer a 40% reduction in energy efficiency. These findings
provide valuable insights for optimising RRAM-based CIM accelerators for
energy-efficient deep learning.

Abstract: Inter-beam interference poses a significant challenge in low Earth orbit
(LEO) satellite communications due to dense satellite constellations. To
address this issue, we introduce spacetime beamforming, a novel paradigm that
leverages the spacetime channel vector, uniquely determined by the angle of
arrival (AoA) and relative Doppler shift, to optimize beamforming between a
moving satellite transmitter and a ground station user. We propose two
space-time beamforming techniques: spacetime zero-forcing (ST-ZF) and
space-time signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (ST-SLNR) maximization. In a
partially connected interference channel, ST-ZF achieves a 3dB SNR gain over
the conventional interference avoidance method using maximum ratio transmission
beamforming. Moreover, in general interference networks, ST-SLNR beamforming
significantly enhances sum spectral efficiency compared to conventional
interference management approaches. These results demonstrate the effectiveness
of space-time beamforming in improving spectral efficiency and interference
mitigation for next-generation LEO satellite networks.

Abstract: Water management is one of the most critical aspects of our society, together
with population increase and climate change. Water scarcity requires a better
characterization and monitoring of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs). This
paper presents a novel framework for monitoring Water Distribution Networks
(WDNs) by integrating physics-informed modeling of the nonlinear interactions
between pressure and flow data with Topological Signal Processing (TSP)
techniques. We represent pressure and flow data as signals defined over a
second-order cell complex, enabling accurate estimation of water pressures and
flows throughout the entire network from sparse sensor measurements. By
formalizing hydraulic conservation laws through the TSP framework, we provide a
comprehensive representation of nodal pressures and edge flows that incorporate
higher-order interactions captured through the formalism of cell complexes.
This provides a principled way to decompose the water flows in WDNs in three
orthogonal signal components (irrotational, solenoidal and harmonic). The
spectral representations of these components inherently reflect the
conservation laws governing the water pressures and flows. Sparse
representation in the spectral domain enable topology-based sampling and
reconstruction of nodal pressures and water flows from sparse measurements. Our
results demonstrate that employing cell complex-based signal representations
enhances the accuracy of edge signal reconstruction, due to proper modeling of
both conservative and non-conservative flows along the polygonal cells.

Result: 数值仿真验证了所提出策略的有效性，并在多种网络设置中与基线方法进行了性能对比。

Conclusion: 基于GNN的调度策略能有效适应网络动态，实现性能与公平性的平衡。

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal link scheduling in large-scale wireless ad
hoc networks. We specifically aim for the maximum long-term average
performance, subject to a minimum transmission requirement for each link to
ensure fairness. With a graph structure utilized to represent the conflicts of
links, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the scheduling
policy, which is parameterized with a graph neural network (GNN). To address
the challenge of long-term performance, we use the state-augmentation
technique. In particular, by augmenting the Lagrangian dual variables as
dynamic inputs to the scheduling policy, the GNN can be trained to gradually
adapt the scheduling decisions to achieve the minimum transmission
requirements. We verify the efficacy of our proposed policy through numerical
simulations and compare its performance with several baselines in various
network settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在内部杂波运动和高噪声的情况下，高维STAP的协方差矩阵估计在低样本条件下具有挑战性，传统方法（如SCM）失效。

Method: 采用“带状+尖峰”结构建模协方差矩阵，提出凸松弛的Frobenius范数最小化方法，并开发新算法联合估计带状杂波协方差和噪声功率。

Result: 在RFView仿真中，该方法显著优于TABASCO、Spiked Covariance Stein Shrinkage和Diagonal Loading，尤其在协方差矩阵维度超过样本数时SCNR更高。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了高维STAP协方差矩阵估计问题，尤其在低样本和复杂噪声条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Estimating the clutter-plus-noise covariance matrix in high-dimensional STAP
is challenging in the presence of Internal Clutter Motion (ICM) and a high
noise floor. The problem becomes more difficult in low-sample regimes, where
the Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM) becomes ill-conditioned. To capture the ICM
and high noise floor, we model the covariance matrix using a ``Banded+Spiked''
structure. Since the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for this model is
non-convex, we propose a convex relaxation which is formulated as a Frobenius
norm minimization with non-smooth convex constraints enforcing banded sparsity.
This relaxation serves as a provable upper bound for the non-convex likelihood
maximization and extends to cases where the covariance matrix dimension exceeds
the number of samples. We derive a variational inequality-based bound to assess
its quality. We introduce a novel algorithm to jointly estimate the banded
clutter covariance and noise power. Additionally, we establish conditions
ensuring the estimated covariance matrix remains positive definite and the
bandsize is accurately recovered. Numerical results using the high-fidelity
RFView radar simulation environment demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a
higher Signal-to-Clutter-plus-Noise Ratio (SCNR) than state-of-the-art methods,
including TABASCO, Spiked Covariance Stein Shrinkage, and Diagonal Loading,
particularly when the covariance matrix dimension exceeds the number of
samples.

Conclusion: MambaBF为卫星通信中的同频干扰抑制提供了一种高效、低复杂度的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate downlink co-frequency interference (CFI)
mitigation in non-geostationary satellites orbits (NGSOs) co-existing systems.
Traditional mitigation techniques, such as Zero-forcing (ZF), produce a null
towards the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the interfering signals, but they
suffer from high computational complexity due to matrix inversions and required
knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, adaptive
beamformers, such as sample matrix inversion (SMI)-based minimum variance,
provide poor performance when the available snapshots are limited. We propose a
Mamba-based beamformer (MambaBF) that leverages an unsupervised deep learning
(DL) approach and can be deployed on the user terminal (UT) antenna array, for
assisting downlink beamforming and CFI mitigation using only a limited number
of available array snapshots as input, and without CSI knowledge. Simulation
results demonstrate that MambaBF consistently outperforms conventional
beamforming techniques in mitigating interference and maximizing the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), particularly under challenging
conditions characterized by low SINR, limited snapshots, and imperfect CSI.

Motivation: 宽频XL-MIMO系统是未来6G网络的关键技术，但信道估计面临近场传播效应、波束分裂和空间非平稳性等挑战，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 作者将信道估计建模为最大后验问题，提出了一种展开近端梯度下降网络，结合学习步长和神经网络替代近端算子，并通过单调下降约束优化训练过程。

Result: 理论分析和仿真结果表明，该方法在估计精度上优于传统和基于深度学习的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了宽频XL-MIMO系统的信道估计性能，为未来6G网络的实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multipleoutput (XL-MIMO) enables the
formation of narrow beams, effectively mitigating path loss in high-frequency
communications. This capability makes the integration of wideband
high-frequency communications with XL-MIMO a key enabler for future 6G
networks. Realizing the full potential of such wideband XL-MIMO systems
critically depends on acquiring accurate channel state information. However,
this acquisition is significantly challenged by inherent wideband XLMIMO
channel characteristics, including near-field propagation effects, beam split,
and spatial non-stationarity. We formulate the channel estimation as a maximum
a posteriori problem and propose an unrolled proximal gradient descent network.
The network integrates learnable step sizes and replaces the proximal operator
with a neural network to implicitly learn channel prior knowledge without
requiring explicit regularization terms. To enhance the convergence behavior,
we incorporated a monotonic descent constraint on the layer-wise estimation
error during training. This constrained learning problem is addressed using a
primal-dual training approach. Theoretical analysis is provided to characterize
the duality gap and convergence behavior of the proposed method. Furthermore,
simulation results are presented to validate its effectiveness, demonstrating
gains in estimation accuracy over both traditional and deep learning-based
methods.

Motivation: 随着6G通信向毫米波和太赫兹频段发展，传统平面波假设不再适用，导致阵列增益损失、定位精度下降等问题，需重新定义远场起始点。

Result: 数值评估显示，提出的过渡距离可超过瑞利距离一个数量级，为6G近场通信和感知提供了可靠工具。

Conclusion: 通过量化近场效应，研究为6G系统的资源高效设计和可靠通信提供了明确路径。

Abstract: The transition toward 6G is pushing wireless communication into a regime
where the classical plane-wave assumption no longer holds. Millimeter-wave and
sub-THz frequencies shrink wavelengths to millimeters, while meter-scale arrays
featuring hundreds of antenna elements dramatically enlarge the aperture.
Together, these trends collapse the classical Rayleigh far-field boundary from
kilometers to mere single-digit meters. Consequently, most practical 6G indoor,
vehicular, and industrial deployments will inherently operate within the
radiating near-field, where reliance on the plane-wave approximation leads to
severe array-gain losses, degraded localization accuracy, and excessive pilot
overhead. This paper re-examines the fundamental question: Where does the
far-field truly begin? Rather than adopting purely geometric definitions, we
introduce an application-oriented approach based on user-defined error budgets
and a rigorous Fresnel-zone analysis that fully accounts for both amplitude and
phase curvature. We propose three practical mismatch metrics: worst-case
element mismatch, worst-case normalized mean square error, and spectral
efficiency loss. For each metric, we derive a provably optimal transition
distance--the minimal range beyond which mismatch permanently remains below a
given tolerance--and provide closed-form solutions. Extensive numerical
evaluations across diverse frequencies and antenna-array dimensions show that
our proposed thresholds can exceed the Rayleigh distance by more than an order
of magnitude. By transforming the near-field from a design nuisance into a
precise, quantifiable tool, our results provide a clear roadmap for enabling
reliable and resource-efficient near-field communications and sensing in
emerging 6G systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新颖的故障检测方法，结合主成分分析（PCA）和由蝗虫优化算法（GOA）优化的深度神经网络（DNN），以解决无线传感器网络（WSNs）中传统方法在高效性和非线性关系捕捉上的不足。该方法在真实数据集上实现了99.72%的分类准确率。

Motivation: 传统故障检测方法在处理高维数据和非线性关系时效率低下，且难以通过梯度优化找到最优网络架构。为了提高WSNs中故障检测的准确性和效率，本研究提出了这一新方法。

Method: 首先使用PCA将12维数据降维至4维（保留99.5%方差），然后用GOA优化一个六层DNN的结构，从而克服反向传播算法的局限性。

Result: 在真实WSNs数据集上的实验表明，该方法的分类准确率达到99.72%，且计算效率高，适合大规模部署。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的PCA-GOA-DNN混合框架显著提升了WSNs中的故障检测性能，为资源受限的网络提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Fault detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is crucial for reliable
data transmission and network longevity. Traditional fault detection methods
often struggle with optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for efficient
performance, especially in handling high-dimensional data and capturing
nonlinear relationships. Additionally, these methods typically suffer from slow
convergence and difficulty in finding optimal network architectures using
gradient-based optimization. This study proposes a novel hybrid method
combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a DNN optimized by the
Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) to address these limitations. Our
approach begins by computing eigenvalues from the original 12-dimensional
dataset and sorting them in descending order. The cumulative sum of these
values is calculated, retaining principal components until 99.5% variance is
achieved, effectively reducing dimensionality to 4 features while preserving
critical information. This compressed representation trains a six-layer DNN
where GOA optimizes the network architecture, overcoming backpropagation's
limitations in discovering nonlinear relationships. This hybrid PCA-GOA-DNN
framework compresses the data and trains a six-layer DNN that is optimized by
GOA, enhancing both training efficiency and fault detection accuracy. The
dataset used in this study is a real-world WSNs dataset developed by the
University of North Carolina, which was used to evaluate the proposed method's
performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves a
remarkable 99.72% classification accuracy, with exceptional precision and
recall, outperforming conventional methods. The method is computationally
efficient, making it suitable for large-scale WSN deployments, and represents a
significant advancement in fault detection for resource-constrained WSNs.

Abstract: The growing global energy demand and the urgent need for sustainability call
for innovative ways to boost energy efficiency. While advanced energy-saving
systems exist, they often fall short without user engagement. Providing
feedback on energy consumption behavior is key to promoting sustainable
practices. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a promising solution by
disaggregating total household energy usage, recorded by a central smart meter,
into appliance-level data. This empowers users to optimize consumption.
Advances in AI, IoT, and smart meter adoption have further enhanced NILM's
potential.
  Despite this promise, real-world NILM deployment faces major challenges.
First, existing datasets mainly represent regions like the USA and UK, leaving
places like the Mediterranean underrepresented. This limits understanding of
regional consumption patterns, such as heavy use of air conditioners and
electric water heaters. Second, deep learning models used in NILM require high
computational power, often relying on cloud services. This increases costs,
raises privacy concerns, and limits scalability, especially for households with
poor connectivity. This thesis tackles these issues with key contributions. It
presents an interoperable data collection framework and introduces the Plegma
Dataset, focused on underrepresented Mediterranean energy patterns. It also
explores advanced deep neural networks and model compression techniques for
efficient edge deployment. By bridging theoretical advances with practical
needs, this work aims to make NILM scalable, efficient, and adaptable for
global energy sustainability.

Abstract: Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate aggregate household
electricity consumption into individual appliance usage, enabling more
effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains
limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack
of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce the first prompt-based NILM
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with in-context learning.
We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features,
timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series
examples, using the REDD dataset. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve
competitive state detection accuracy, reaching an average F1-score of 0.676 on
unseen households, and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for
fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance interpretability by providing clear,
human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs
can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent
energy disaggregation in NILM applications.

Abstract: The OpenSky Network has been collecting and providing crowdsourced air
traffic surveillance data since 2013. The network has primarily focused on
Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) data, which provides
high-frequency position updates over terrestrial areas. However, the ADS-B
signals are limited over oceans and remote regions, where ground-based
receivers are scarce. To address these coverage gaps, the OpenSky Network has
begun incorporating data from the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Contract
(ADS-C) system, which uses satellite communication to track aircraft positions
over oceanic regions and remote areas. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of
over 720,000 ADS-C messages collected in 2024 from around 2,600 unique aircraft
via the Alphasat satellite, covering Europe, Africa, and parts of the Atlantic
Ocean. We present our approach to combining ADS-B and ADS-C data to construct
detailed long-haul flight paths, particularly for transatlantic and African
routes. Our findings demonstrate that this integration significantly improves
trajectory reconstruction accuracy, allowing for better fuel consumption and
emissions estimates. We illustrate how combined data captures flight patterns
across previously underrepresented regions across Africa. Despite coverage
limitations, this work marks an important advancement in providing open access
to global flight trajectory data, enabling new research opportunities in air

Abstract: Deepfake audio presents a growing threat to digital security, due to its
potential for social engineering, fraud, and identity misuse. However, existing
detection models suffer from poor generalization across datasets, due to
implicit identity leakage, where models inadvertently learn speaker-specific
features instead of manipulation artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study to explicitly analyze and address identity leakage in the
audio deepfake detection domain. This work proposes an identity-independent
audio deepfake detection framework that mitigates identity leakage by
encouraging the model to focus on forgery-specific artifacts instead of
overfitting to speaker traits. Our approach leverages Artifact Detection
Modules (ADMs) to isolate synthetic artifacts in both time and frequency
domains, enhancing cross-dataset generalization. We introduce novel dynamic
artifact generation techniques, including frequency domain swaps, time domain
manipulations, and background noise augmentation, to enforce learning of
dataset-invariant features. Extensive experiments conducted on ASVspoof2019,
ADD 2022, FoR, and In-The-Wild datasets demonstrate that the proposed
ADM-enhanced models achieve F1 scores of 0.230 (ADD 2022), 0.604 (FoR), and
0.813 (In-The-Wild), consistently outperforming the baseline. Dynamic Frequency
Swap proves to be the most effective strategy across diverse conditions. These
findings emphasize the value of artifact-based learning in mitigating implicit
identity leakage for more generalizable audio deepfake detection.

Result: 通过数据驱动方法实现了RIS的快速配置，并能够生成更复杂的辐射模式，优化了信号泄漏加噪声比。

Conclusion: 该方法为RIS配置提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，克服了传统建模的局限性，为实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: A promising type of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) employs tunable
control of its varactors using biasing transmission lines below the RIS
reflecting elements. Biasing standing waves (BSWs) are excited by a
time-periodic signal and sampled at each RIS element to create a desired
biasing voltage and control the reflection coefficients of the elements. A
simple rectifier can be used to sample the voltages and capture the peaks of
the BSWs over time. Like other types of RIS, attempting to model and accurately
configure a wave-controlled RIS is extremely challenging due to factors such as
device non-linearities, frequency dependence, element coupling, etc., and thus
significant differences will arise between the actual and assumed performance.
An alternative approach to solving this problem is data-driven: Using training
data obtained by sampling the reflected radiation pattern of the RIS for a set
of BSWs, a neural network (NN) is designed to create an input-output map
between the BSW amplitudes and the resulting sampled radiation pattern. This is
the approach discussed in this paper. In the proposed approach, the NN is
optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the error between the
predicted and measured radiation patterns. The BSW amplitudes are then designed
via Simulated Annealing (SA) to optimize a signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio
measure by iteratively forward-propagating the BSW amplitudes through the NN
and using its output as feedback to determine convergence. The resulting
optimal solutions are stored in a lookup table to be used both as settings to
instantly configure the RIS and as a basis for determining more complex
radiation patterns.

### [43] [ALPCAH: Subspace Learning for Sample-wise Heteroscedastic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07272)
*Javier Salazar Cavazos,Jeffrey A. Fessler,Laura Balzano*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了ALPCAH和LR-ALPCAH两种方法，用于处理异方差数据并估计噪声方差，以改进低秩数据结构的子空间估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的主成分分析（PCA）在数据质量不均（即异方差性）的情况下表现不佳。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了ALPCAH方法，旨在估计样本级噪声方差并优化子空间估计。

Method: ALPCAH方法无需对低秩成分做分布假设，也不需要预先知道噪声方差或子空间维度。LR-ALPCAH是矩阵分解版本，速度更快且内存效率更高，但需要预先知道子空间维度。

Result: 模拟和真实数据实验表明，ALPCAH在考虑数据异方差性后优于现有算法。

Conclusion: ALPCAH提供了一种高效且灵活的方法来处理异方差数据，并在不依赖先验信息的情况下改进子空间估计。

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data
dimensionality reduction. However, some applications involve heterogeneous data
that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data
sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This
paper develops a subspace learning method, named ALPCAH, that can estimate the
sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of
the subspace basis associated with the low-rank structure of the data. Our
method makes no distributional assumptions of the low-rank component and does
not assume that the noise variances are known. Further, this method uses a soft
rank constraint that does not require subspace dimension to be known.
Additionally, this paper develops a matrix factorized version of ALPCAH, named
LR-ALPCAH, that is much faster and more memory efficient at the cost of
requiring subspace dimension to be known or estimated. Simulations and real
data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data
heteroscedasticity compared to existing algorithms. Code available at

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过码扩展技术解决深度极化码在非2幂次块长度场景下的速率匹配问题的方法，并设计了解码算法和贪婪算法进行多层优化，实验验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度极化码在短块长度下表现优异，但其块长度受限于2的幂次，难以灵活匹配实际需求，需要一种有效的速率匹配技术。

Method: 采用码扩展技术，通过串联多层极化码码字实现速率匹配，并开发了软输出连续消除列表解码算法和贪婪优化算法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在中高码率场景下显著优于传统速率匹配方法。

Conclusion: 通过码扩展和多层优化，深度极化码在非2幂次块长度下实现了高性能速率匹配和可靠解码。

Abstract: Deep polar codes are pre-transformed polar codes that employ a multi-layered
polar kernel transformation strategy to enhance code performance in short
blocklength regimes. However, like conventional polar codes, their block length
is constrained to powers of two, as the final transformation layer uses a
conventional polar kernel matrix. This paper introduces a novel rate-matching
technique for deep polar codes using code extension, particularly effective
when the desired code length slightly exceeds a power of two. The key idea is
to exploit the layered structure of deep polar codes by concatenating polar
codewords generated at each transformation layer. Based on this structure, we
also develop an efficient decoding algorithm leveraging soft-output successive
cancellation list decoding and provide comprehensive error probability analysis
supporting our code design algorithms. Additionally, we propose a
computationally efficient greedy algorithm for multi-layer configurations.
Extensive simulations confirm that our approach delivers substantial coding
gains over conventional rate-matching methods, especially in medium to high
code-rate regimes.

Result: 数值结果表明，即使在CSI不完美的情况下，所提方案也能超越完美CSI条件下的基准方案。

Conclusion: 在CSI不完美的场景下，结合最大比传输和图算法的优化方法显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a promising solution for
reconfiguring wireless channel conditions through local antenna movement within
confined regions. Unlike previous works assuming perfect channel state
information (CSI), this letter addresses the robust MA position optimization
problem under imperfect CSI conditions for a multiple-input single-output
(MISO) MA system. Specifically, we consider two types of CSI errors:
norm-bounded and randomly distributed errors, aiming to maximize the worst-case
and non-outage received signal power, respectively. For norm-bounded CSI
errors, we derive the worst-case received signal power in closed-form. For
randomly distributed CSI errors, due to the intractability of the probabilistic
constraints, we apply the Bernstein-type inequality to obtain a closed-form
lower bound for the non-outage received signal power. Based on these results,
we show the optimality of the maximum-ratio transmission for imperfect CSI in
both scenarios and employ a graph-based algorithm to obtain the optimal MA
positions. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can even outperform
other benchmark schemes implemented under perfect CSI conditions.

Abstract: The pinching-antenna architecture has emerged as a promising solution for
reconfiguring wireless propagation environments and enhancing system
performance. While prior research has primarily focused on sum-rate
maximization or transmit power minimization of pinching-antenna systems, the
critical aspect of energy efficiency (EE) has received limited attention. Given
the increasing importance of EE in future wireless communication networks, this
work investigates EE optimization in a non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA)-assisted multi-user pinching-antenna uplink system. The problem entails
the joint optimization of the users' transmit power and the pinching-antenna
position. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex due to tightly
coupled variables. To tackle this, we employ an alternating optimization
framework to decompose the original problem into two subproblems: one focusing
on power allocation and the other on antenna positioning. A low-complexity
optimal solution is derived for the power allocation subproblem, while the
pinching-antenna positioning subproblem is addressed using a particle swarm
optimization algorithm to obtain a high-quality near-optimal solution.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly
outperforms both conventional-antenna configurations and orthogonal multiple
access-based pinching-antenna systems in terms of EE.

Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) enables fast data aggregation for edge
intelligence applications. However the performance of AirComp can be severely
degraded by channel misalignments. Pinching antenna systems (PASS) have
recently emerged as a promising solution for physically reshaping favorable
wireless channels to reduce misalignments and thus AirComp errors, via
low-cost, fully passive, and highly reconfigurable antenna deployment.
Motivated by these benefits, we propose a novel PASS-aided AirComp system that
introduces new design degrees of freedom through flexible pinching antenna (PA)
placement. To improve performance, we consider a mean squared error (MSE)
minimization problem by jointly optimizing the PA position, transmit power, and
decoding vector. To solve this highly non-convex problem, we propose an
alternating optimization based framework with Gauss-Seidel based PA position
updates. Simulation results show that our proposed joint PA position and
communication design significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes in
AirComp accuracy.

Abstract: A customizable method (OPTIKS) for designing fast trajectory-constrained
gradient waveforms with optimized time domain properties was developed. Given a
specified multidimensional k-space trajectory, the method optimizes traversal
speed (and therefore timing) with position along the trajectory. OPTIKS
facilitates optimization of objectives dependent on the time domain gradient
waveform and the arc-length domain k-space speed. OPTIKS is applied to design
waveforms which limit peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), minimize mechanical
resonance excitation, and reduce acoustic noise. A variety of trajectory
examples are presented including spirals, circular echo-planar-imaging, and
rosettes. Design performance is evaluated based on duration, standardized PNS
models, field measurements, gradient coil back-EMF measurements, and calibrated
acoustic measurements. We show reductions in back-EMF of up to 94% and field
oscillations up to 91.1%, acoustic noise decreases of up to 9.22 dB, and with
efficient use of PNS models speed increases of up to 11.4%. The design method
implementation is made available as an open source Python package through
GitHub.

Abstract: This letter proposes a design of low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), low

optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) systems. The
proposed design leverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) incorporating gradual
loss learning to jointly optimize the geometry and probability of the
constellation's symbols. This not only enhances mutual information (MI) but
also effectively reduces the PAPR while maintaining a low SER for reliable
transmission. We evaluate the performance of the proposed VAE-based design by
comparing the MI, SER, and PAPR against existing techniques. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a considerably lower PAPR while
maintaining superior SER and MI performance for a wide range of SNRs.

Motivation: 量化室内环境中动态环境因素（如温度、湿度、CO2浓度等）对LoRaWAN信号传播的影响，以优化物联网设备的网络可靠性和电池寿命。

Method: 在室内办公室环境中，通过6个LoRaWAN终端设备和1个网关，系统测量信号强度指标（如RSSI和SNR），并测试集成了环境参数和多墙阻碍的改进路径损耗模型（LDPLSM-MW-EP）。

Result: 改进模型（LDPLSM-MW-EP）将均方根误差从10.58 dB降至8.04 dB，决定系数从0.6917提升至0.8222。

Conclusion: 该研究为室内物联网部署提供了优化网络可靠性和设备寿命的实用方法，数据集也为未来无线通信研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive dataset of LoRaWAN technology path loss
measurements collected in an indoor office environment, focusing on quantifying
the effects of environmental factors on signal propagation. Utilizing a network
of six strategically placed LoRaWAN end devices (EDs) and a single indoor
gateway (GW) at the University of Siegen, City of Siegen, Germany, we
systematically measured signal strength indicators such as the Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under various
environmental conditions, including temperature, relative humidity, carbon
dioxide (CO$_2$) concentration, barometric pressure, and particulate matter
levels (PM$_{2.5}$). Our empirical analysis confirms that transient phenomena
such as reflections, scattering, interference, occupancy patterns (induced by
environmental parameter variations), and furniture rearrangements can alter
signal attenuation by as much as 10.58 dB, highlighting the dynamic nature of
indoor propagation. As an example of how this dataset can be utilized, we
tested and evaluated a refined Log-Distance Path Loss and Shadowing Model that
integrates both structural obstructions (Multiple Walls) and Environmental
Parameters (LDPLSM-MW-EP). Compared to a baseline model that considers only
Multiple Walls (LDPLSM-MW), the enhanced approach reduced the root mean square
error (RMSE) from 10.58 dB to 8.04 dB and increased the coefficient of
determination (R$^2$) from 0.6917 to 0.8222. By capturing the extra effects of
environmental conditions and occupancy dynamics, this improved model provides
valuable insights for optimizing power usage and prolonging device battery
life, enhancing network reliability in indoor Internet of Things (IoT)
deployments, among other applications. This dataset offers a solid foundation
for future research and development in indoor wireless communication.

Motivation: AIGC技术虽然提升了远程操作的安全性和效率，但其服务质量的不确定性和激励AIGC服务提供商（ASPs）的需求使得设计鲁棒的激励机制变得至关重要。

Abstract: Advanced AI-Generated Content (AIGC) technologies have injected new impetus
into teleoperation, further enhancing its security and efficiency. Edge AIGC
networks have been introduced to meet the stringent low-latency requirements of
teleoperation. However, the inherent uncertainty of AIGC service quality and
the need to incentivize AIGC service providers (ASPs) make the design of a
robust incentive mechanism essential. This design is particularly challenging
due to both uncertainty and information asymmetry, as teleoperators have
limited knowledge of the remaining resource capacities of ASPs. To this end, we
propose a distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based contract theory to
design robust reward schemes for AIGC task offloading. Notably, our work
extends the contract theory by integrating DRO, addressing the fundamental
challenge of contract design under uncertainty. In this paper, contract theory
is employed to model the information asymmetry, while DRO is utilized to
capture the uncertainty in AIGC service quality. Given the inherent complexity
of the original DRO-based contract theory problem, we reformulate it into an
equivalent, tractable bi-level optimization problem. To efficiently solve this
problem, we develop a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD)-based algorithm to derive
robust reward schemes. Simulation results on our unity-based teleoperation
platform demonstrate that the proposed method improves teleoperator utility by
2.7\% to 10.74\% under varying degrees of AIGC service quality shifts and
increases ASP utility by 60.02\% compared to the SOTA method, i.e., Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based contract theory. The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/Zijun0819/DRO-Contract-Theory.
