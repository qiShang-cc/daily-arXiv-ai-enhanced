The factor\nmatrices of multi-linear transformations are parameterized by BDD domain grids\nand SnS factors, where beam domain grids are jointly determined by angles and\nslopes under spatial-chirp based NF representations. To enable tractable\ninference, we replace environment-dependent BDD domain grids with uniformly\nsampled ones, and introduce perturbation parameters in each domain to mitigate\ngrid mismatch. We further propose a hybrid beam domain strategy that integrates\nangle-only sampling with slope hyperparameterization to avoid the computational\nburden of explicit slope sampling.

However, unlike text, speech conveys not only linguistic\ncontent but also rich paralinguistic features. Encoding these elements in an\nentangled fashion may be suboptimal, as it limits flexibility. For instance,\nvoice conversion (VC) aims to convert speaker characteristics while preserving\nthe original linguistic content, which requires a disentangled representation.\nInspired by VC methods utilizing $k$-means quantization with self-supervised\nfeatures to disentangle phonetic information, we develop a discrete NAC capable\nof structured disentanglement. Experimental evaluations show that our approach\nachieves reconstruction performance on par with conventional NACs that do not\nexplicitly perform disentanglement, while also matching the effectiveness of\nconventional VC techniques."}

While many methods address complex spectral\nvariability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by\nfactors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major\nchallenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate\nmodel fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that\ncorrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and\ncompensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm\nprovides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively\non modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present\na rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive\nexperimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's\nimpact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing\nalgorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed\npreprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms,\nincluding those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with\nerror reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale\ncorrection acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by\nexisting methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight\nits potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines.\nThe implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication."}

The proposed AVSE system employs convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) for spectral feature extraction and long short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetworks for temporal modeling, enabling robust speech enhancement through\nmultimodal fusion of audio and visual cues. Multiple deployment scenarios are\ninvestigated, including cloud-based, edge-assisted, and standalone device\nimplementations. Their performance is evaluated in terms of speech quality\nimprovement, latency, and computational overhead. Real-world experiments are\nconducted across various network conditions, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 4G, and\n5G, to analyze the trade-offs between processing delay, communication latency,\nand perceptual speech quality. The results show that while cloud deployment\nachieves the highest enhancement quality, edge-assisted architectures offer the\nbest balance between latency and intelligibility, meeting real-time\nrequirements under 5G and Wi-Fi 6 conditions. These findings provide practical\nguidelines for selecting and optimizing AVSE deployment architectures in\ndiverse applications, including assistive hearing devices, telepresence, and\nindustrial communications."}
