However, it cannot directly\nmeasure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection\nfraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic\nresonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed\nstructural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL\nachieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving\npatients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac\nfunction parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.

However, its performance is highly sensitive to its\nparameters, and manual or heuristic tuning often yields suboptimal results. To\novercome this limitation, we propose a unified differentiable formulation of\nthe STFT that enables gradient-based optimization of its parameters. This\napproach addresses the limitations of traditional STFT parameter tuning\nmethods, which often rely on computationally intensive discrete searches. It\nenables fine-tuning of the time-frequency representation (TFR) based on any\ndesired criterion. Moreover, our approach integrates seamlessly with neural\nnetworks, allowing joint optimization of the STFT parameters and network\nweights. The efficacy of the proposed differentiable STFT in enhancing TFRs and\nimproving performance in downstream tasks is demonstrated through experiments\non both simulated and real-world data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u77ed\u65f6\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\uff08STFT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSTFT\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u6563\u641c\u7d22\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206STFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u51c6\u5219\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5fae\u5206STFT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u517c\u5bb9\u3002"}}
