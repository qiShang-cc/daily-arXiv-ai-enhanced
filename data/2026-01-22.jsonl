This paper proposes a bidirectional calibration scheme and a calibration coefficient estimation method for phase synchronization, and presents a calibration coefficient phase tracking method using unilateral uplink/downlink channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, this paper introduces the use of reciprocity calibration to eliminate non-ideal factors in sensing and leverages sensing results to achieve calibration coefficient phase tracking in dynamic scenarios, thus enabling bidirectional empowerment of both communication and sensing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively implement reciprocal calibration with lower overhead, enabling coherent collaborative transmission, and resolving non-ideal factors to acquire lower sensing error in sensing applications. Experimental results show that, in the mmWave band, over-the-air (OTA) bidirectional calibration enables coherent collaborative transmission for both collaborative TRPs and collaborative user equipments (UEs), achieving beamforming gain and long-time coherent sensing capabilities."}

In this work, we propose a GPR-based channel estimation framework along with a novel Spatial-correlation (SC) kernel that explicitly captures the channel's second-order statistics. We derive a closed-form expression of the proposed SC-based GPR estimator and prove that its posterior mean is optimal in terms of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) under the same second-order statistics, without requiring the underlying channel distribution to be Gaussian. Our analysis reveals that, with up to 50% pilot overhead reduction, the proposed method achieves the lowest normalized mean-square error, the highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and superior preservation of spectral efficiency compared to benchmark estimators, while maintaining lower computational complexity than the conventional MMSE estimator."}

We consider multiple Willies operating in both non-colluding and colluding modes. For noncolluding Willies, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation procedure to reformulate the challenging optimization problem into a more tractable form. Subsequently, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that integrates semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), Dinkelbach transformation, and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to tackle the resulting problem. For colluding Willies, we first derive the minimum detection error probability (DEP) by characterizing the optimal detection statistic, which is proven to follow the generalized Erlang distribution.

One such impairment is sampling jitter (SJ), which arises due to imperfections in the sampling instants of the clocks of digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). While SJ is already well studied for communication systems based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which is expected to be the waveform of choice for most sixth-generation (6G) scenarios where ISAC could be possible, the implications of SJ on the OFDM-based radar sensing must still be thoroughly analyzed. Considering that phase-locked loop (PLL)-based oscillators are used to derive sampling clocks, which leads to colored SJ, i.e., SJ with non-flat power spectral density, this article analyzes the resulting distortion of the adopted digital constellation modulation and sensing performance in OFDM-based ISAC for both baseband (BB) and bandpass (BP) sampling strategies and different oversampling factors. For BB sampling, it is seen that SJ induces intercarrier interference (ICI), while for BP sampling, it causes carrier phase error and more severe ICI due to a phase noise-like effect at the digital intermediate frequency. Obtained results for a single-input single-output OFDM-based ISAC system with various OFDM signal parameterizations demonstrate that SJ-induced degradation becomes non-negligible for both BB and BP sampling only for root mean square (RMS) SJ values above 10^-11 s at both DAC and ADC, which corresponds to 0.5*10^-2 times the considered critical sampling period without oversampling. Based on the achieved results, it can be concluded that state-of-the-art hardware enables sufficient communication and sensing robustness against SJ, as RMS SJ values in the femtosecond range can be achieved."}

The need for robust, high-fidelity haptic systems is critical for enhancing the precision and reliability of teleoperated surgical tools. Methods: In this study, we present a Nonlinear Impedance Matching Approach (NIMA) designed to improve force rendering by accurately modelling complex tool-tissue interactions. Based on our previously validated Impedance Matching Approach (IMA), our novel NIMA method includes nonlinear dynamics to capture and render tool-tissue forces effectively. Results: NIMA improves force feedback accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01 (SD 0.02) N, achieving a 95% reduction in MAE compared to IMA. Furthermore, NIMA effectively eliminates haptic \"kickback\" by ensuring no force is applied by the haptic device to the user's hand when they release the handle, enhancing both patient safety and user comfort. Conclusion: NIMA's ability to account for nonlinearities in tool-tissue interactions provides an improvement in force fidelity, responsiveness, and precision across various surgical conditions.

In this work, we propose an deep learning (DL)-based CSI reconstruction framework that serves as an enabler for reliable CSI acquisition in future 6G systems. The proposed solution involves designing a port-cycling mechanism that sequentially sounds different portions of CSI ports across time, thereby lowering the overhead while preserving channel observability. The proposed CSI Adaptive Network (CsiAdaNet) model exploits the resulting sparse measurements and captures both spatial and temporal correlations to accurately reconstruct the full-port CSI. The simulation results show that our method achieves overhead reduction while maintaining high CSI reconstruction accuracy."}

From a single partial observation, multiple incompatible 3D completions may be plausible, causing grasps that appear feasible on one completion to fail on another. We propose an uncertainty-aware grasping pipeline for partially occluded strawberries that explicitly models completion uncertainty arising from both occlusion and learned shape reconstruction. Our approach uses point cloud completion with Monte Carlo dropout to sample multiple shape hypotheses, generates candidate grasps for each completion, and evaluates grasp feasibility using physically grounded force-closure-based metrics. Rather than selecting a grasp based on a single estimate, we aggregate feasibility across completions and apply a conservative lower confidence bound (LCB) criterion to decide whether a grasp should be attempted or safely abstained. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and on a physical robot across increasing levels of synthetic and real leaf occlusion. Results show that uncertainty-aware decision making enables reliable abstention from high-risk grasp attempts under severe occlusion while maintaining robust grasp execution when geometric confidence is sufficient, outperforming deterministic baselines in both simulated and physical robot experiments."}

Yet, most neural attention tracking studies are still limited to highly controlled lab settings, using clean, often audio-only stimuli and requiring sustained attention to a single talker. This work addresses that gap by introducing a novel dataset from 24 normal-hearing participants. We used a mobile electroencephalography (EEG) system (44 scalp electrodes and 20 cEEGrid electrodes) in an audiovisual (AV) paradigm with three conditions: sustained attention to a single talker in a two-talker environment, attention switching between two talkers, and unscripted two-talker conversations with a competing single talker. Analysis included temporal response functions (TRFs) modeling, optimal lag analysis, selective attention classification with decision windows ranging from 1.1s to 35s, and comparisons of TRFs for attention to AV conversations versus side audio-only talkers. Key findings show significant differences in the attention-related P2-peak between attended and ignored speech across conditions for scalp EEG. No significant change in performance between switching and sustained attention suggests robustness for attention switches. Optimal lag analysis revealed narrower peak for conversation compared to single-talker AV stimuli, reflecting the additional complexity of multi-talker processing. Classification of selective attention was consistently above chance (55-70% accuracy) for scalp EEG, while cEEGrid data yielded lower correlations, highlighting the need for further methodological improvements. These results demonstrate that mobile EEG can reliably track selective attention in dynamic, multisensory listening scenarios and provide guidance for designing future AV paradigms and real-world attention tracking applications."}

This limitation is particularly relevant in practice, as many systems rely on small vision language models (VLMs) for efficiency. Compared to large language models, small VLMs exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities, making effective prompt design critical for accurate navigation. Inspired by cognitive theories of human learning and motivation, we study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing, where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves. Experiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets reveal three key findings. First, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans achieves the best performance, while competition against other AI systems performs worst. For finetuned models, competition against the model's past self yields the strongest results, followed by competition against humans, with performance further influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics. Second, inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance, even compared to direct finetuning. Third, while direct finetuning substantially improves semantic-level metrics such as perception, prediction, and reasoning, it yields limited gains in action accuracy. In contrast, our system prompts produce a disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy, indicating that the proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement."}

In active sensing applications, such as radar, sonar, wireless communications, and medical ultrasound, a collection of sensors probes the environment by emitting self-generated energy. A key benefit of such active multi-sensor arrays is their ability to focus and steer energy in desired directions by beamforming on transmit. Sparse sensor arrays offer several advantages over conventional uniform arrays, including improved resolution using fewer physical sensors and the capability to identify more scatterers than sensors. This is facilitated by the effective transmit-receive virtual array known as the sum co-array, which can have many more virtual sensors than the number of physical transmit or receive sensors. Herein, we focus on the design of low-redundancy sparse array configurations and on employing transmit-receive (Tx-Rx) beamforming using sparse arrays. We discuss the optimal, but computationally intractable Minimum-redundancy array, and a scalable symmetric array framework, which extends many well-known passive sparse array geometries to the active case. We also examine mitigating side lobes arising from spatial undersampling by a synthetic beamforming method known as image addition. We briefly present approaches for finding the physical beamforming weights synthesizing a desired Tx-Rx beampattern, and consider related spatio-temporal trade-offs. We conclude by discussing selected applications of sparse arrays in active sensing."}

Even though weather radars are the most prominent technology for weather detection and monitoring, they are expensive and usually neglect areas in close vicinity. To this end, we propose reusing the dense deployment of 6G base stations for weather sensing purposes by detecting and estimating weather conditions. We implement both a classifier and a regressor as a convolutional neural network trained across measurements with varying precipitation rates and wind speeds. We implement our approach in an ISAC proof-of-concept, and conduct a multi-week experiment campaign. Experimental results show that we are able to jointly and accurately classify weather conditions with accuracies of 99.38% and 98.99% for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively.

However, repeatedly probing posture-dependent viscoelastic responses immediately after landing impact is difficult in biological specimens, leaving the contribution of skeletal architecture to landing dynamics incompletely understood. In this study, we developed an anthropomimetic foot joint structure aimed at replicating the skeletal geometry of the human foot. Using a vertical drop apparatus that simulates landing and a viscoelastic system-identification model, we investigated how skeletal structure and posture modulate the apparent post-impact viscoelastic response. The results show that the multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure exhibited a higher damping ratio than simplified flat and rigid feet. Moreover, ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension systematically shifted the identified parameters, reducing the damping ratio under the tested conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that an arch-like, multi-jointed skeletal architecture can enhance impact attenuation in an anthropomimetic mechanical foot, and that morphology and passive posture alone can tune the trade-off between attenuation and rebound. The observed posture-dependent trends are qualitatively consistent with reported differences in human landing strategies, suggesting that skeletal architecture may partly account for the modulation. Furthermore, these results highlight the engineering advantage of anatomically informed skeletal replication for achieving human-like apparent viscoelastic behavior through postural adjustment during landing."}

Despite recent progress, existing MM methods still face two key limitations: (i) low sample efficiency, due to ineffective use of redundant data generated during long-term MM interactions; and (ii) poor spatial generalization, as policies trained on specific tasks struggle to transfer to new spatial layouts without additional training. In this paper, we address these challenges through Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination. In particular, AES makes MM agents pay more attention to critical experience fragments in long trajectories that affect task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Based on AES, a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is introduced for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) by capturing the coupled dynamics between the mobile base and the manipulator and imagining the dynamics of future manipulations. RSSM-based MPFP can reinforce MM skill learning on the current task while enabling effective generalization to new spatial layouts. Comparative studies across different experimental configurations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MM policies. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of our method."}

However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \\emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines."}

We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines.

We present a 1.47 mm diameter modular soft robotic catheter that integrates sensing, actuation, and therapy while retaining the compliance needed for safe endoluminal navigation. Validated across multiple in vivo settings, we emphasize its utility in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a highly technical procedure and a key access route to the pancreas, an organ that is fragile, difficult to instrument, and central to diseases such as pancreatic cancer. Our architecture supports up to four independently controlled functional units, allowing customizable combinations of anchoring, manipulation, sensing, and targeted drug delivery. In a live porcine model, we demonstrate semi-autonomous deployment into the pancreatic duct and 7.5 cm of endoscopic navigation within it, a region currently inaccessible with standard catheters. A closed-loop autonomous/shared-control system that combines a learned model, magnetic actuation, onboard shape sensing, and visual marker tracking further improves cannulation accuracy.

This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency."}

To address this problem, this paper proposes dynamic window pure pursuit (DWPP), which fundamentally reformulates the command velocity computation process to explicitly incorporate velocity and acceleration constraints. Specifically, DWPP formulates command velocity computation in the velocity space (the $v$-$ω$ plane) and selects the command velocity as the point within the dynamic window that is closest to the line $ω= κv$. Experimental results demonstrate that DWPP avoids constraint-violating commands and achieves superior path-tracking accuracy compared with conventional pure pursuit methods.

As such, the assessment of risk in automated driving is key in supporting both motion planning technologies and safety evaluation. In automated driving, risk is characterized by two aspects. The first aspect is the uncertainty on the state estimates of other road participants by an automated vehicle. The second aspect is the severity of a collision event with said traffic participants. Here, the uncertainty aspect typically causes the risk to be non-zero for near-collision events. This makes risk particularly useful for automated vehicle motion planning. Namely, constraining or minimizing risk naturally navigates the automated vehicle around traffic participants while keeping a safety distance based on the level of uncertainty and the potential severity of the impending collision. Existing approaches to calculate the risk either resort to empirical modeling or severe approximations, and, hence, lack generalizability and accuracy. In this paper, we combine recent advances in collision probability estimation with the concept of collision severity to develop a general method for accurate risk estimation. The proposed method allows us to assign individual severity functions for different collision constellations, such as, e.g., frontal or side collisions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, which is beneficial, e.g., in real-time motion planning applications.

Consequently, mitigating age-related declines in gait stability and reducing fall risk during walking is a critical goal for assistive devices. Lower-limb exoskeletons have the potential to support users in maintaining stability during walking. However, most exoskeleton controllers are optimized to reduce the energetic cost of walking rather than to improve stability. While some studies report stability benefits with assistance, the effects of specific parameters, such as assistance magnitude and duration, remain unexplored. To address this gap, we systematically modulated the magnitude and duration of torque provided by a bilateral hip exoskeleton during slip perturbations in eight healthy adults, quantifying stability using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). WBAM responses were governed by a significant interaction between assistance magnitude and duration, with duration determining whether exoskeleton assistance was stabilizing or destabilizing relative to not wearing the exoskeleton device. Compared to an existing energy-optimized controller, experimentally identified stability-optimal parameters reduced WBAM range by 25.7% on average. Notably, substantial inter-subject variability was observed in the parameter combinations that minimized WBAM during perturbations. We found that optimizing exoskeleton assistance for energetic outcomes alone is insufficient for improving reactive stability during gait perturbations. Stability-focused exoskeleton control should prioritize temporal assistance parameters and include user-specific personalization. This study represents an important step toward personalized, stability-focused exoskeleton control, with direct implications for improving stability and reducing fall risk in older adults."}

First, we propose a context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis. By dynamically maintaining a map of prohibited spatial areas as objects are placed, our system prevents interpenetration and ensures reachable, conflict-free configurations in cluttered environments.

It requires an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can run on board light-weight flying robots under tight resource and time constraints, while pushing the physical system to its limits. The state of the art in this area consists of a system with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that beat human drone racing champions in a controlled indoor environment. Here, we present MonoRace: an onboard drone racing approach that uses a monocular, rolling-shutter camera and IMU that generalizes to a competition environment without any external motion tracking system. The approach features robust state estimation that combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with a drone model. Moreover, it includes an offline optimization procedure that leverages the known geometry of gates to refine any state estimation parameter. This offline optimization is based purely on onboard flight data and is important for fine-tuning the vital external camera calibration parameters. Furthermore, the guidance and control are performed by a neural network that foregoes inner loop controllers by directly sending motor commands. This small network runs on the flight controller at 500Hz. The proposed approach won the 2025 Abu Dhabi Autonomous Drone Racing Competition (A2RL), outperforming all competing AI teams and three human world champion pilots in a direct knockout tournament. It set a new milestone in autonomous drone racing research, reaching speeds up to 100 km/h on the competition track and successfully coping with problems such as camera interference and IMU saturation."}

We identify a fundamental security flaw in modern VLA systems: the combination of action chunking and delta pose representations creates an intra-chunk visual open-loop. This mechanism forces the robot to execute K-step action sequences, allowing per-step perturbations to accumulate through integration. We propose SILENTDRIFT, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack exploiting this vulnerability. Our method employs the Smootherstep function to construct perturbations with guaranteed C2 continuity, ensuring zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries to satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints. Furthermore, our keyframe attack strategy selectively poisons only the critical approach phase, maximizing impact while minimizing trigger exposure. The resulting poisoned trajectories are visually indistinguishable from successful demonstrations. Evaluated on the LIBERO, SILENTDRIFT achieves a 93.2% Attack Success Rate with a poisoning rate under 2%, while maintaining a 95.3% Clean Task Success Rate."}

To address this gap, we present explainable object-oriented HRI (X-OOHRI), an augmented reality (AR) interface that conveys robot action possibilities and constraints through visual signifiers, radial menus, color coding, and explanation tags. Our system encodes object properties and robot limits into object-oriented structures using a vision-language model, allowing explanation generation on the fly and direct manipulation of virtual twins spatially aligned within a simulated environment. We integrate the end-to-end pipeline with a physical robot and showcase diverse use cases ranging from low-level pick-and-place to high-level instructions. Finally, we evaluate X-OOHRI through a user study and find that participants effectively issue object-oriented commands, develop accurate mental models of robot limitations, and engage in mixed-initiative resolution."}

Submitted to ACL ARR 2026 January", "summary": "Autonomous driving is a highly challenging domain that requires reliable perception and safe decision-making in complex scenarios. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving."}

While Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the standard for developing complex applications, existing KR&R frameworks often rely on external ontologies and specialized languages that are difficult to integrate with imperative code. KRROOD addresses this by treating knowledge as a first-class programming abstraction using native class structures, bridging the gap between the logic programming and OOP paradigms. We evaluate the system on the OWL2Bench benchmark and a human-robot task learning scenario. Experimental results show that KRROOD achieves strong performance while supporting the expressive reasoning required for real-world autonomous systems."}

Multi-layered LSTM architecture to train the AoI model with ExiD drone dataset is utilized. In the process, different prediction horizons and different models' workflow are tested. The results show great promise on horizons up to 4 seconds with prediction accuracy starting from about 76% for the AoI and 94% for the general highway scenarios on the maximum horizon."}

We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \\mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \\mid v, \\ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action."}

While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines."}

However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence."}

Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.
