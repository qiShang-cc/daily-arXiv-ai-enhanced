Traditional machine learning approaches, such as deep neural networks, achieve high predictive accuracy but lack interpretability and impose significant computational costs, limiting their applicability in real-time, resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose a stabilized symbolic regression framework to derive compact, analytically interpretable expressions for block error rate prediction. Trained on realistic vehicle-to-everything simulation data, the symbolic regression framework for vehicle-to-everything model accurately captures nonlinear dependencies on key system parameters, including signal-to-noise ratio, relative velocity, modulation and coding schemes, number of demodulation reference signal symbols, and environmental factors (line of sight/non-line of sight). Our final symbolic expression comprises only 158 nodes, enabling ultra-fast inference suitable for embedded deployment. On the test set, the symbolic regression framework for vehicle-to-everything model achieves a coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.8684$ and mean squared error $= 2.08 \\times 10^{-2}$ in the original block error rate domain, outperforming conventional fixed-form regressions and offering comparable accuracy to neural networks while remaining fully interpretable. Overall, the proposed Stabilized Symbolic Regression Framework for V2X combines predictive performance, physical fidelity, and computational efficiency thus providing a powerful tool for real-time V2X communication system design, adaptive resource allocation, and rapid scenario evaluation."}

Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks. These results position multi-pattern RL as a practical, scalable data engine for embodied foundation models."}

This paper was presented in part at the International Symposium on Topics in Coding, August 2025 in the Session for Coding and AI", "summary": "Channel coding from 2G to 5G has assumed the inputs bits at the physical layer to be uniformly distributed. However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel \"free-lunch\" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings."}

To improve the robustness of inter-vehicle data sharing, semantic communication has recently further been integrated into collaborative perception systems to enhance overall performance. However, practical deployment of such systems is challenged by the heterogeneity of sensors across different connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This diversity in perceptual data complicates the design of a unified communication framework and impedes the effective fusion of shared information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-modal semantic communication (CMSC) framework to facilitate effective collaboration among CAVs with disparate sensor configurations. Specifically, the framework first transforms heterogeneous perceptual features from different sensor modalities into a unified and standardized semantic space. Subsequently, encoding, transmission, and decoding are performed within this semantic space, enabling seamless and effective information fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMSC achieves significantly stronger perception performance than existing methods, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes."}

The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

Although fundamental differences between radar and optical sensors lead to differences in the reliability of predicting accurate and consistent category labels, a review of common radar perception tasks in automotive reveals that determining whether an object is moving or static is a prerequisite for most tasks. To fill this gap, this study proposes a neural network based solution that can simultaneously segment static and moving objects from radar point clouds. Furthermore, since the measured radial velocity of static objects is correlated with the motion of the radar, this approach can also estimate the instantaneous 2D velocity of the moving platform or vehicle (ego motion). However, despite performing dual tasks, the proposed method employs very simple yet effective building blocks for feature extraction: multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In addition to being the first of its kind in the literature, the proposed method also demonstrates the feasibility of extracting the information required for the dual task directly from unprocessed point clouds, without the need for cloud aggregation, Doppler compensation, motion compensation, or any other intermediate signal processing steps. To measure its performance, this study introduces a set of novel evaluation metrics and tests the proposed method using a challenging real world radar dataset, RadarScenes. The results show that the proposed method not only performs well on the dual tasks, but also has broad application potential in other radar perception tasks."}

For example, payloads or wind disturbances can significantly influence the dynamics of an aerial vehicle and invalidate the safety guarantee. In this work, we propose an efficient yet flexible online learning-enhanced high-order adaptive control barrier function using Neural ODEs.

A suitable representer theorem allows us to transform the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one, which we then approximate with a low-dimensional surrogate. We solve the resulting optimization problem using a forward-backward splitting (FBS)-based algorithm. By exploiting the problem's modulation structure, we achieve a computational complexity per iteration that is quasi-linear in the number of unknown variables.

To reduce modulation design complexity while increasing computation reliability, this paper integrates a bit-partitioning procedure into ChannelComp. The key process is to partition the input bit sequence into several groups, map each group to a single modulation symbol and transmit the encoded symbol sequence across multiple time slots. With the objective to maximize a worst-case constellation distance, we develop two bit-partitioning methods. In uniform bit-partitioning, bits are evenly distributed across groups and modulation is designed via a max-min optimization, which is handled by a CCCP that solves a sequence of second-order cone programming subproblems. In importance-adaptive bit-partitioning (IABP), the bit allocation is adapted to the significance of individual bit positions, and the modulation and partitioning are jointly optimized. To keep the overall complexity manageable, simulated annealing is employed in the outer loop to update the partitioning, while a CCCP-based solver is used in the inner loop for modulation design. Numerical results show that both methods provide robust computation in noisy channels, and IABP achieves up to a 5 dB reduction in computation error compared to Sequential Modulation for AirComp, especially for product computation."}

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transceiver technology lies at the core of this paradigm, providing the degrees of freedom required for simultaneous data transmission and accurate radar sensing. The tight integration of sensing and communication introduces unique security vulnerabilities that extend beyond conventional physical-layer security (PLS). In particular, high-power transmissions directed at sensing targets may empower adversarial eavesdroppers, whereas passive interception of ISAC echoes can reveal sensitive information such as target locations and mobility patterns. This article presents an overview of recent advances in MIMO ISAC transceiver design, considering transmitter perspectives, receiver architectures, and full-duplex implementations. We examine MIMO transceiver designs under unique security threats specific to ISAC and highlight emerging countermeasures, including secure signaling design, interference exploitation, and transceiver optimization under adversarial conditions.

Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy."}

Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability. Secondly, the RL agent is fine-tuned with real-world deployment feedback, further reducing collapse rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves lower collapse rates in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Large-scale deployments in logistics systems validate the practical effectiveness, with a 35\\% reduction in packing collapse compared to baseline methods."}

Most conventional beamforming methods, whether implemented in the time or frequency domains, suffer from limited axial resolution due to the absence of a reference emission onset time. While frequency-domain methods, the most efficient of which are based on the cross-spectral matrix, require long signals for accurate estimation, time-domain methods typically achieve lower spatial resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a linear model-based beamforming framework fully formulated in the time domain. The linear forward model relates a discretized spatiotemporal distribution of cavitation activity to the temporal signals recorded by a probe, explicitly accounting for time-of-flight delays dictated by the acquisition geometry. This model is then inverted using regularization techniques that exploit prior knowledge of cavitation activity in both spatial and temporal domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves enhanced or competitive cavitation map quality while using only 20\\% of the data typically required by frequency-domain methods. This highlights the substantial gain in data efficiency and the flexibility of our spatiotemporal regularization to adapt to diverse passive cavitation scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques."}

Six-axis force-torque sensors are commonly used to obtain contact feedback, but their high cost and fragility have discouraged many researchers from adopting them in contact-rich tasks. To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation. Extensive experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks and manipulation policies demonstrate that ShapeForce delivers performance comparable to six-axis force-torque sensors at an extremely low cost."}

While line-of-sight (LOS) links are typically expected to dominate in NF scenarios, the impact of non-LOS (NLOS) components at both in centimeter- and millimeter-wave frequencies may be in general non-negligible. Moreover, although weaker than the LOS path, NLOS links may be essential for achieving multiplexing gains in MIMO systems. The commonly used NF channel models for NLOS links in the literature are based on the point scattering assumption, which is not valid for large reflectors such as walls, ceilings, and the ground. In this paper, we develop a generalized statistical NF MIMO channel model that extends the widely adopted point scattering framework to account for imperfect reflections from large surfaces. This model is then leveraged to investigate how the physical characteristics of these reflectors influence the resulting NF MIMO channel. In addition, using the proposed channel model, we analytically demonstrate for a multi-user scenario that, even when users are located within the NF regime, relying solely on LOS NF links may be insufficient to achieve multiplexing gains, thus exploiting NLOS links becomes essential. Our simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed model and show that, in many practical settings, the contribution of NLOS components is non-negligible and must be carefully accounted for in the system design."}

Stochastic geometry offers a rigorous framework by treating base station locations as a Poisson point process and enabling coverage characterization through spatial averaging, but its expressions often involve nested integrals and special functions that limit general applicability. Probabilistic interference models seek closed-form characterizations through moment-based approximations, yet these expressions remain tractable only for restricted parameter choices and become unwieldy when interference moments lack closed-form representations. This work introduces a hybrid approximation framework that addresses these challenges by combining Monte Carlo sampling of a small set of dominant interferers with a Laplace functional representation of the residual far-field interference. The resulting dominant-plus-tail structure provides a modular, numerically stable, and path-loss-agnostic estimator suitable for both noise-limited and interference-limited regimes. We further derive theoretical error bounds that decrease with the number of dominant interferers and validate the approach against established stochastic geometry and probabilistic modeling benchmarks."}

Each handoff between a satellite and ground users introduces additional signaling and power consumption, which can become a significant burden as the size of the constellation continues to increase. This work focuses on the optimization of the total transmission rate in a LEO-to-user system, by jointly considering the total transmitted power, user-satellite associations, and power consumption, the latter being handled through a penalty on handoff events. We consider a system where LEO satellites serve users located in remote areas with no terrestrial connectivity, and formulate the power allocation problem as a mixed-integer concave linear program (MICP) subject to power and association constraints. Our approach can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers and is benchmarked against a naive baseline where users associate to their closest visible satellite. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling the handoff frequency while maintaining high user throughput. These performance gains highlight the effectiveness of our handover-aware optimization strategy, which ensures that user rates improve significantly, by about 40%, without incurring a disproportionate rise in the handoff frequency."}

A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details. This architecture enables robustness, flexibility, and cross-task generalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose a generic soft-robot control framework grounded in control compliance and validate it across robots with diverse morphologies and actuation mechanisms. The results demonstrate stable, safe, and cross-platform transferable behavior, indicating that embracing control compliance, rather than resisting it, may provide a widely applicable foundation for unified soft-robot control."}

Simultaneously, we explicitly model the external pulling disturbances through a spring-damper system and achieve fine-grained force control by manipulating the virtual spring. During this process, the reinforcement-learning policy spontaneously generates disturbance-rejection response by exploiting environmental feedback.

However, challenges such as channel aging, user mobility, and feedback delays significantly impact the performance of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). This paper proposes and evaluates two CSI prediction frameworks applicable to both time division duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. The proposed methods operate in the effective signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) domain to reduce complexity while preserving predictive accuracy. A comparative analysis is conducted between a classical Wiener filter and state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks based on gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and a delayed deep neural network (DNN). The evaluation considers the accuracy of the prediction in terms of mean squared error (MSE), the performance of the system, and the complexity of the implementation regarding floating point operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of both approaches under various propagation conditions. The simulation results show that the Wiener filter performs close to GRU in terms of MSE and throughput with lower computational complexity, provided that the second-order statistics of the channel are available. However, the GRU model exhibits enhanced generalization across different channel scenarios. These findings suggest that while learningbased solutions are well-suited for TDD systems where the base station (BS) handles the computation, the lower complexity of classical methods makes them a preferable choice for FDD setups, where prediction occurs at the power-constrained user equipment (UE)."}

A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction.

However, real-time adaptability in dynamic environments remains a critical challenge for autonomous navigation, particularly when robots must generate collision-free, smooth, and efficient trajectories under complex constraints. By analyzing the difficulties in dynamic path planning, the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) algorithm emerges as a promising framework owing to its physically interpretable search dynamics. Motivated by these observations, this work revisits the WDO principle and proposes a variant formulation, Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization(MAWDO), that improves adaptability and robustness in time-varying environments. To mitigate instability and premature convergence, a hierarchical-guidance mechanism divides the population into multiple groups guided by individual, regional, and global leaders to balance exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations on sixteen benchmark functions show that MAWDO achieves superior optimization accuracy, convergence stability, and adaptability over state-of-the art metaheuristics. In dynamic path planning, MAWDO shortens the path length to 469.28 pixels, improving over Multi-strategy ensemble wind driven optimization(MEWDO), Adaptive wind driven optimization(AWDO) and WDO by 3.51\\%, 11.63\\% and 14.93\\%, and achieves the smallest optimality gap (1.01) with smoothness 0.71 versus 13.50 and 15.67 for AWDO and WDO, leading to smoother, shorter, and collision-free trajectories that confirm its effectiveness for real-time path planning in complex environments."}

This paper tackles this problem and allows to extend existing rigid-body pose estimation methods to non-rigid systems. Our approach hinges on two core assumptions: first, the elastic properties are captured by an injective deformation-force model, efficiently learned via a Multi-Layer Perceptron; second, we solve the platform's inherently smooth motion using continuous-time B-spline kinematic models. By continuously applying Newton's Second Law, our method establishes a physical link between visually-derived trajectory acceleration and predicted deformation-induced acceleration. We demonstrate that our approach not only enables robust and accurate pose estimation on non-rigid platforms, but that the properly modeled platform physics instigate inertial sensing properties. We demonstrate this feasibility on a simple spring-camera system, and show how it robustly resolves the typically ill-posed problem of metric scale and gravity recovery in monocular visual odometry."}

We address both data efficiency and optimization stability in VLA post-training via a learned world model and an RL procedure tailored to flow-based action heads. Specifically, we introduce Prophet, a unified action-to-video robot actuation pretrained across large-scale, heterogeneous robot data to learn reusable action-outcome dynamics. It is able to few-shot adapt to new robots, objects, and environments, yielding a rollout-ready simulator. Upon Prophet, we reinforce action policies with Flow-action-GRPO (FA-GRPO), which adapts Flow-GRPO to operate on VLA actions, and with FlowScale, a stepwise reweighting that rescales per-step gradients in the flow head. Together, Prophet, FA-GRPO, and FlowScale constitute ProphRL, a practical, data- and compute-efficient path to VLA post-training.

We then express the dual function in terms of the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation parameterized by the dual variable. Under a certain assumption on the system dynamics and cost function, it is shown that a strong duality holds between the primal chance-constrained problem and its dual.

The resulting continuous-time dynamics achieve an $O(1/t)$ convergence rate to first-order stationary points under standard constraint qualification conditions.

We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely.

We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path.

We introduce \\emph{CostNav}, a \\textbf{Micro-Navigation Economic Testbed} that evaluates embodied agents through comprehensive cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. \\textbf{To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability}, revealing that optimizing for task success fundamentally differs from optimizing for economic deployment. Our cost model uses parameters derived from industry data sources (energy rates, delivery service pricing), and we project from a reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries. Under this projection, the baseline achieves 43.0\\% SLA compliance but is \\emph{not} commercially viable: yielding a loss of \\$30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, because operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance, which accounts for 99.7\\% of per-run costs and highlights collision avoidance as a key optimization target. We demonstrate a learning-based on-device navigation baseline and establish a foundation for evaluating rule-based navigation, imitation learning, and cost-aware RL training. CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms."}

Submitted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2026 for possible publication", "summary": "3D reconstruction for Digital Twins often relies on LiDAR-based methods, which provide accurate geometry but lack the semantics and textures naturally captured by cameras. Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion approaches require complex calibration and still struggle with certain materials like glass, which are visible in images but poorly represented in point clouds. We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements. We validate our camera-only method using an internal dataset from an instrumented test vehicle, leveraging LiDAR as ground truth for reflectivity validation alongside image similarity metrics."}

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced."}

While diffusion models can generate diverse and expressive motions conditioned on text and scene context, they often produce physically implausible outputs, leading to execution drift during simulation. To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner. We validate the effectiveness of BRIC on a variety of long-term tasks, including motion composition, obstacle avoidance, and human-scene interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all tasks."}

Here we present MIMIC-MJX, a framework for learning biologically-plausible neural control policies from kinematics. MIMIC-MJX models the generative process of motor control by training neural controllers that learn to actuate biomechanically-realistic body models in physics simulation to reproduce real kinematic trajectories. We demonstrate that our implementation is accurate, fast, data-efficient, and generalizable to diverse animal body models. Policies trained with MIMIC-MJX can be utilized to both analyze neural control strategies and simulate behavioral experiments, illustrating its potential as an integrative modeling framework for neuroscience."}

A promising path forward is high-fidelity simulation that combines photorealistic sensor rendering with geometrically grounded interaction in complex, open-world urban environments. Although recent video-3DGS methods ease open-world scene capturing, they are still unsuitable for benchmarking due to large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Wanderland, a real-to-sim framework that features multi-sensor capture, reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Using this pipeline, we curate a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes and systematically demonstrate how image-only pipelines scale poorly, how geometry quality impacts novel view synthesis, and how all of these adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability. Beyond serving as a trusted testbed for embodied navigation, Wanderland's rich raw sensor data further allows benchmarking of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models. Our work establishes a new foundation for reproducible research in open-world embodied AI. Project website is at https://ai4ce.github.io/wanderland/."}
