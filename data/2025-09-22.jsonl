However,\nthe accuracy and resolution of the Bartlett beamformer are fundamentally\nlimited by the array aperture. In this paper, we propose a deep learning\ntechnique, comprising a novel architecture and training strategy, for\ngenerating a high-resolution spatial spectrum from a single snapshot.\nSpecifically, we train a deep neural network that takes the measurements and a\nhypothesis angle as input and learns to output a score consistent with the\ncapabilities of a much wider array.

Motion retargeting is a crucial step in enabling\nrobots to acquire reference trajectories when exploring locomotion skills.\nHowever, current methods focus on motion retargeting frame by frame, which\nlacks scalability. Could we directly convert large-scale human motion into\nrobot-executable motion through a more efficient approach? To address this\nissue, we propose Implicit Kinodynamic Motion Retargeting (IKMR), a novel\nefficient and scalable retargeting framework that considers both kinematics and\ndynamics. In kinematics, IKMR pretrains motion topology feature representation\nand a dual encoder-decoder architecture to learn a motion domain mapping. In\ndynamics, IKMR integrates imitation learning with the motion retargeting\nnetwork to refine motion into physically feasible trajectories. After\nfine-tuning using the tracking results, IKMR can achieve large-scale physically\nfeasible motion retargeting in real time, and a whole-body controller could be\ndirectly trained and deployed for tracking its retargeted trajectories. We\nconduct our experiments both in the simulator and the real robot on a full-size\nhumanoid robot. Extensive experiments and evaluation results verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed framework."}

Our approach leverages Koopman\noperator theory, which enables a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics by\nlifting trajectories into a higher-dimensional space. The framework follows a\ntwo-stage design: first, a probabilistic neural goal estimator predicts\nplausible long-term targets, specifying where to go; second, a Koopman\noperator-based refinement module incorporates intention and history into a\nnonlinear feature space, enabling linear prediction that dictates how to go.\nThis dual structure not only ensures strong predictive accuracy but also\ninherits the favorable properties of linear operators while faithfully\ncapturing nonlinear dynamics. As a result, our model offers three key\nadvantages: (i) competitive accuracy, (ii) interpretability grounded in Koopman\nspectral theory, and (iii) low-latency deployment. We validate these benefits\non ETH/UCY, the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, and nuScenes, which feature rich\nmulti-agent interactions and map-constrained nonlinear motion. Across\nbenchmarks, KoopCast consistently delivers high predictive accuracy together\nwith mode-level interpretability and practical efficiency."}

However,\nexisting autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent\npredictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and\ninadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \\textbf{S}cale-wise\n\\textbf{A}utoregression with \\textbf{M}otion \\textbf{P}r\\textbf{O}mpt\n(\\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive\nmodeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame\ngeneration. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with\nbidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports\nparallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both\ntemporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene\nunderstanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves\nspatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations\nfor future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.\nAdditionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects\nspatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on\ndynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.\nExtensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in\naction-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving\ngeneration quality with 4.4$\\times$ faster inference.

An\nEMLA model is formulated to capture motor electromechanics and\ndirection-dependent transmission efficiencies, while a mathematical model of\nthe HDRM, incorporating both kinematics and dynamics, is established to\ngenerate joint-space motion profiles for prescribed TCP trajectories. A\nsafety-ensured trajectory generator, tailored to this model, maps Cartesian\ngoals to joint space while enforcing joint-limit and velocity margins. Based on\nthe resulting force and velocity demands, a multi-objective Non-dominated\nSorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to select the optimal EMLA\nconfiguration. To accelerate this optimization, a deep neural network, trained\nwith EMLA parameters, is embedded in the optimization process to predict\nsteady-state actuator efficiency from trajectory profiles. For the chosen EMLA\ndesign, a physics-informed Kriging surrogate, anchored to the analytic model\nand refined with experimental data, learns residuals of EMLA outputs to support\nforce and velocity sensorless control.

For this purpose, the open source\nsimulation tool CARLA is used; according to our knowledge this is a novel\napproach in the context of logistics simulation. First, CARLA is used to\ngenerate and visualize a realistic 3D outdoor warehouse scenario, incorporating\na number of randomly moving forklifts. In a next step, intralogistics transport\ntasks, such as pick-and-place, are simulated for the forklift fleet, including\nshortest-path finding. Furthermore, the capability to play back localization\ndata, previously recorded from a ''real'' forklift fleet, is demonstrated.This\nplay back is done in the original recreated environment, thereby enabling the\nvisualization of the forklifts movements. Finally, the energy consumption of\nthe forklift trucks is simulated by integrating a physical battery model that\ngenerates the state of charge (SOC) of each truck as a function of load and\nactivity. To demonstrate the wide range of possible applications for the CARLA\nsimulation platform, we describe two use cases.

SPReD uses ensemble methods to\nexplicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy\nactions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary\nuncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood\nof demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation\nby statistical significance.
