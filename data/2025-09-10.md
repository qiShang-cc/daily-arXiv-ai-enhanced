### [1] [Cross-device Zero-shot Label Transfer via Alignment of Time Series Foundation Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06966)
*Neal G. Ravindra,Arijit Sehanobish*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）将源域和目标域投影到共享潜在嵌入空间，并用对抗性对齐方法实现跨设备标签转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决消费级可穿戴设备数据缺乏高质量医学标签的问题，避免昂贵且不可扩展的手动标注。

Method: 使用TSFMs将源域和目标域投射到共享潜在空间，并通过对抗性对齐技术对齐两者的分布。

Result: 成功实现了跨设备（如从临床动态记录仪到Apple Watch）的标签转移。

Conclusion: 该方法为消费级可穿戴设备提供了高效且经济的标签解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality, medically validated labels exist for clinical actigraphy data
but not for ubiquitous consumer wearables like the Apple Watch. Manually
labeling wearables data is expensive and doesn't scale. This paper offers a
novel framework that transfers valuable labels from a source domain (e.g.,
actigraphy) to a target domain (e.g., Apple Watch) without requiring paired
data. Instead of working with raw time-series signals, we project both domains
into a shared latent embedding space using time-series foundation models
(TSFMs) and develop a new framework to align the cross-device representations.
Our method, Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings forces the distributions
of source and target embeddings to align within this space, facilitating label
transfer across device type.

### [2] [Cross-field SNR Analysis and Tensor Channel Estimation for Multi-UAV Near-field Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06967)
*Tianyu Huo,Jian Xiong,Yiyan Wu,Songjie Yang,Bo Liu,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了分布式近场多无人机通信系统中的信道估计问题，提出了一种混合球面-平面波模型（HSPWM），并基于此开发了两种信道估计算法：球面域正交匹配追踪（SD-OMP）和张量-OMP。结果表明，张量-OMP在性能上与SD-OMP相当，但计算复杂度更低且可扩展性更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超大规模天线阵列（ELAA）在6G网络中至关重要，但由于其分布式多无人机系统常工作在近场区域，传统的远场平面波假设失效，因此需要新的信道估计方法。

Method: 论文推导了平面波模型（PWM）、球面波模型（SWM）和混合球面-平面波模型（HSPWM）的信噪比表达式，并提出SD-OMP和张量-OMP两种算法进行信道估计。

Result: 仿真结果显示，张量-OMP的归一化均方误差（NMSE）性能与SD-OMP相当，但计算复杂度更低，可扩展性更强。

Conclusion: HSPWM在建模精度和分析易处理性之间取得了良好平衡，张量-OMP为该问题提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is key to enhancing spectral efficiency
in 6G networks. Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often
operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the
conventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates
channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems.
We first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the
plane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid
spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model,
within a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario. The analysis shows
that HSPWM achieves a good balance between modeling accuracy and analytical
tractability. Based on this, we propose two channel estimation algorithms: the
spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and the tensor-OMP. The
SD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and
range. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor,
enabling the use of tensor-OMP. Simulation results demonstrate that tensor-OMP
achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP,
while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC通过结合感知与通信功能，被视为6G网络的关键技术，能够降低硬件复杂度、缓解频谱拥堵并提高能效。

Result: 研究表明，基于深度学习的技术能够高效地为复杂ISAC任务提供近最优解，适用于实时系统。

Conclusion: 文章总结并分类了前沿的基于深度学习的ISAC技术，指出了其优势、挑战及未来研究方向。

Abstract: This article comprehensively reviews recent developments and research on deep
learning-based (DL-based) techniques for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) systems. ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities,
is regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging
applications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate
both sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified
platform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate
frequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,
integrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly
optimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant
computational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or
optimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,
DL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced
computational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating
under limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time
systems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal
solutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including
waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data
demodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these
advantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC
system design. After briefly introducing DL architectures and ISAC
fundamentals, this survey presents a comprehensive and categorized review of
state-of-the-art DL-based techniques for ISAC, highlights their key advantages
and major challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.

Motivation: 研究动机是表征月球南极卫星间链路在不同倾角下的多普勒频移分布，以提供独立于载波频率的分析方法。

Method: 方法包括使用高斯混合模型（GMM）拟合多普勒频移数据，并通过KL散度和加权平均相对差异（WMRD）评估拟合优度。

Result: 结果表明，当轨道倾角偏离参考轨道80°时，多普勒频移可达±1.89 ppm；GMM拟合的WMRD和KL散度最大分别为0.6575和2.2963。

Conclusion: 结论显示GMM是拟合ISL多普勒频移分布的有效模型，但误差指标较高，表明仍需优化模型或方法。

Abstract: This study investigates the RF-based Doppler shift distribution
characterization of the Lunar South Pole (LSP) based inter-satellite link (ISL)
in varying inclination. Doppler shift in parts per million (ppm) is determined
and analyzed, as it provides an independence from the carrier frequency. Due to
unknown relative velocity states duration, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is
found to be the best fitting distribution for ISLs with $1^\circ$ inclination
interval Doppler shift with respect to a predetermined satellite.
Goodness-of-fit is investigated and quantified with Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and weighted mean relative difference (WMRD) error metrics.
Simulation results show that ISL Doppler shifts reach up to $\pm1.89$ ppm as
the inclination of the other orbit deviates higher from the reference orbit,
inclining $80^\circ$. Regarding the error measurements of GMM fitting, the WMRD
and KL divergence metrics for ISL take values up to 0.6575 and 2.2963,
respectively.

### [5] [Impact of Fading Correlation on the High-SNR Regime of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07172)
*Paula Isabel Tilleria Lucero,Bryan Fernando Sarango Rodríguez,Fernando Darío Almeida García,José Cândido Silveira Santos Filho*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文分析了RIS辅助无线系统在高SNR区的性能，克服了固定分集增益、受限空间相关性和无效近似方法的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前研究中固定分集增益、空间相关性受限及高SNR区行为未能准确捕捉的问题。

Method: 采用精确渐近分析法，研究SNR分布左尾行为，并考虑具有可变分集和编码增益的Nakagami-m衰落信道。

Result: 结果表明衰落相关性导致PDF和CDF曲线的水平位移，线性系数量化位移角度系数不变。

Conclusion: 高SNR区性能分析的关键在于相关性对所有渐近项的累积贡献，准确反映了信道特性。

Abstract: This paper addresses three critical limitations in previous analyses of
RIS-aided wireless systems: propagation environments with fixed diversity gain,
restricted spatial correlation profiles, and approximation methods that fail to
capture the system behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. To
overcome these challenges, we conduct an exact asymptotic analysis focused on
the left tail of the SNR distribution, which plays a critical role in high-SNR
system performance. Additionally, to account for general correlation profiles
and fading environments with variable diversity and coding gains, we consider
arbitrarily correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. The analytical results show
that fading correlation induces a horizontal shift in the asymptotic behavior
-- represented as a straight line in the log-dB scale -- of the PDF and CDF,
displacing these curves to the left. The asymptotic linear coefficient
quantifies this shift, while the angular coefficient remains unaffected.
Moreover, the results reveal that the high sensitivity of the linear
coefficient to correlation arises from the aggregated contribution of all
marginal asymptotic terms, effectively capturing each channel's correlation
characteristics.

### [6] [Joint Spatial and Spectral Hybrid Precoding for Multi-User MIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07229)

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于硬件限制，毫米波MIMO系统无法仅依赖数字预编码。混合预编码成为平衡性能和成本的潜在方案，但面临OFDM的高PAPR和OOB排放问题，以及相位误差。

Method: 提出了一种基于WMMSE-BCD的方法，迭代优化发射端的数字-RF预编码器和用户端的数字-RF合并器，解决了非凸优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法在效率和性能上优于已知基准。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了混合MIMO-OFDM系统中的预编码优化问题，为实际应用提供了低成本、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems cannot rely solely on digital precoding due to hardware
constraints. Instead, hybrid precoding, which combines digital and radio
frequency (RF) techniques, has emerged as a potential alternative. This
approach strikes a balance between performance and cost, addressing the
limitations of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters in mmWave
systems. mmWave systems are designed to function in wideband channels with
frequency selectivity, necessitating the use of orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) to mitigate dispersive channels. However, OFDM faces
several challenges. First, it suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) due to the linear combination of subcarriers. Second, it suffers from
out-of-band (OOB) emissions due to the sharp spectral transitions of OFDM
subcarriers and windowing-induced spectral leakage. Furthermore, phase shifter
(PS) impairments at the RF transmitter precoder and the user combiner represent
a limitation in practical mmWave systems, leading to phase errors. This work
addresses these challenges.
  We study the problem of robust digital-RF precoding optimization for the
downlink sum-rate maximization in hybrid multi-user (MU) MIMO-OFDM systems
under maximum transmit power, PAPR, and OOB emission constraints. The
formulated maximization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We
propose a weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) based block coordinate
descent (BCD) method to iteratively optimize digital-RF precoders at the
transmitter and digital-RF combiners at the users. Low-cost and scalable
optimization approaches are proposed to efficiently solve the BCD subproblems.
Extensive simulation results are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed approaches and exhibit their superiority relative to well-known
benchmarks.

Conclusion: Wave-Controlled RIS展示了通过单一驻波频率实现反射控制的潜力，简化了RIS设计。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), an emerging technology proposed
for inclusion in next generation wireless communication systems, are
programmable surfaces that can adaptively reflect incident electromagnetic
radiation in different desired directions. To reduce the complexity and
physical profile of conventional RIS designs, a novel concept known as
Wave-Controlled RIS has been proposed, in which standing waves along a
transmission line are used to generate the required dc bias for reflective
control. This paper shows the design of such a Wave-Controlled RIS and its
biasing transmission line. The effectiveness of this approach in generating the
correct dc bias from a single standing wave frequency is analyzed through both
theoretical modeling and experimental validation, which uncovered a dependence
on impedance matching not accounted for by the theory. Additionally, the
potential for reflective control using only a single standing wave frequency on
the biasing transmission line is explored, demonstrating the ability of
single-beam steering toward angles near broadside.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于眼动特征的去漂移（FGD）方法，有效减少EOG信号中的基线漂移，显著提高了注视跟踪的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EOG信号在HRC中被广泛用于注视跟踪，但低频噪声引起的基线漂移严重影响了信号准确性，亟需解决方案。

Method: FGD方法通过主动识别眼动特征重建EOG基线，自适应校正漂移，同时保持波形形态完整。

Result: 在仿真和实际数据中，FGD方法的平均误差分别降低了36.29%和26.53%。

Conclusion: FGD方法在实用场景中优于传统技术，增强了人机协作中的性能表现。

Abstract: Electrooculography (EOG) is widely used for gaze tracking in Human-Robot
Collaboration (HRC). However, baseline drift caused by low-frequency noise
significantly impacts the accuracy of EOG signals, creating challenges for
further sensor fusion. This paper presents an Eye Movement Feature-Guided
De-drift (FGD) method for mitigating drift artifacts in EOG signals. The
proposed approach leverages active eye-movement feature recognition to
reconstruct the feature-extracted EOG baseline and adaptively correct signal
drift while preserving the morphological integrity of the EOG waveform. The FGD
is evaluated using both simulation data and real-world data, achieving a
significant reduction in mean error. The average error is reduced to
0.896{\deg} in simulation, representing a 36.29% decrease, and to 1.033{\deg}
in real-world data, corresponding to a 26.53% reduction. Despite additional and
unpredictable noise in real-world data, the proposed method consistently
outperforms conventional de-drifting techniques, demonstrating its
effectiveness in practical applications such as enhancing human performance
augmentation.

Result: 提出了MMICM框架的架构、特点及关键技术，并展望了其系统应用和潜在研究方向。

Conclusion: MMICM框架为6G网络智能系统提供了创新的信道建模方法。

Abstract: The design and technology development of 6G-enabled networked intelligent
systems needs an accurate real-time channel model as the cornerstone. However,
with the new requirements of 6G-enabled networked intelligent systems, the
conventional channel modeling methods face many limitations. Fortunately, the
multi-modal sensors equipped on the intelligent agents bring timely
opportunities, i.e., the intelligent integration and mutually beneficial
mechanism between communications and multi-modal sensing could be investigated
based on the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. In this case, the
mapping relationship between physical environment and electromagnetic channel
could be explored via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). This article presents a
novel multi-modal intelligent channel modeling (MMICM) framework for 6G-enabled
networked intelligent systems, which establishes a nonlinear model between
multi-modal sensing and channel characteristics, including large-scale and
small-scale channel characteristics. The architecture and features of proposed
intelligent modeling framework are expounded and the key technologies involved
are also analyzed. Finally, the system-engaged applications and potential
research directions of MMICM framework are outlined.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合去噪和生理相关特征的机器学习流程，用于早产预测，CatBoost分类器在TPEHGT数据集上达到了97.28%的准确率和0.9988的AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早产是新生儿死亡和长期健康问题的主要原因，早期检测对及时医疗干预至关重要。

Method: 采用Mel频率倒谱系数、小波系数统计描述和归一化功率谱峰值提取特征，并通过基于特征值的KL变换去噪。评估了多种分类器。

Result: CatBoost分类器结合KL去噪在TPEHGT数据集上表现最佳，EHG信号单独使用已足够预测早产。

Conclusion: 结合去噪和生理相关特征可构建高准确性和临床可解释的模型，支持低成本早产预测工具的研发。

Abstract: Preterm birth (PTB), defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is a
leading cause of neonatal mortality and long term health complications. Early
detection is essential for enabling timely medical interventions.
Electrohysterography (EHG) and tocography (TOCO) are promising non invasive
tools for PTB prediction, but prior studies often suffer from class imbalance,
improper oversampling, and reliance on features with limited physiological
relevance. This work presents a machine learning pipeline incorporating robust
preprocessing, physiologically grounded feature extraction, and rigorous
evaluation. Features were extracted from EHG (and TOCO) signals using Mel
frequency cepstral coefficients, statistical descriptors of wavelet
coefficients, and peaks of the normalized power spectrum. Signal quality was
enhanced via Karhunen Lo\`eve Transform (KLT) denoising through eigenvalue
based subspace decomposition. Multiple classifiers, including Logistic
Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting,
Multilayer Perceptron, and CatBoost, were evaluated on the TPEHGT dataset. The
CatBoost classifier with KLT denoising achieved the highest performance on
fixed interval segments of the TPEHGT dataset, reaching 97.28% accuracy and an
AUC of 0.9988. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of both KLT
denoising and physiologically informed features. Comparative analysis showed
that including TOCO signals did not substantially improve prediction over EHG
alone, highlighting the sufficiency of EHG for PTB detection. These results
demonstrate that combining denoising with domain relevant features can yield
highly accurate, robust, and clinically interpretable models, supporting the
development of cost effective and accessible PTB prediction tools, particularly
in low resource healthcare settings.

Conclusion: SA-OOSC通过场景感知动态分配编码资源，显著提升语义通信效率，为相关研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces SA-OOSC, a multimodal large language models
(MLLM)-distilled semantic communication framework that achieves efficient
semantic coding with scenario-aware importance allocations. This approach
addresses a critical limitation of existing object-oriented semantic
communication (OOSC) systems - assigning static importance values to specific
classes of objects regardless of their contextual relevance. Our framework
utilizes MLLMs to identify the scenario-augmented (SA) semantic importance for
objects within the image. Through knowledge distillation with the
MLLM-annotated data, our vectorization/de-vectorization networks and JSCC
encoder/decoder learn to dynamically allocate coding resources based on
contextual significance, i.e., distinguishing between high-importance objects
and low-importance according to the SA scenario information of the task. The
framework features three core innovations: a MLLM-guided knowledge distillation
pipeline, an importance-weighted variable-length JSCC framework, and novel loss
function designs that facilitate the knowledge distillation within the JSCC
framework. Experimental validation demonstrates our framework's superior coding
efficiency over conventional semantic communication systems, with open-sourced
MLLM-annotated and human-verified datasets established as new benchmarks for
future research in semantic communications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for accurately estimating the relative position
between two nodes with unknown locations in a diffusion-based molecular
communication environment. A specialized node structure is designed, combining
a central absorbing receiver with multiple transmitters placed at predefined
spherical coordinates. Pilot molecules are released, and their absorption time
and concentration are measured. By partitioning the spherical coordinate space,
these spatially distinct measurements serve as input to a multilayer perceptron
(MLP)-based model. The proposed method significantly improves the precision of
distance and direction estimation. Simulation results demonstrate localization
accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of the neural network model in capturing
the underlying physical characteristics.

### [13] [A Systematic Framework to Test the Resilience of Three-Fold Redundant Sparse Arrays Against Two Sensor Failures and Some Never-Before Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07442)
*Ashish Patwari,Andrés Alayón Glazunov*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个系统性框架来评估三重冗余稀疏线性阵列（TRSLAs）的鲁棒性，针对所有可能的双传感器故障进行了分析，发现现有设计存在隐藏漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着稀疏阵列领域的发展，最大化经济稀疏阵列（MESA）对单个传感器故障极为敏感，无法承受任何传感器故障。多重冗余稀疏阵列（MFRSA）通过确保每个空间滞后多次生成来提高鲁棒性，但仍存在隐藏依赖性问题。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一个系统性框架，用于评估TRSLAs在所有可能的双传感器故障情况下的鲁棒性，并通过MATLAB程序和数值模拟进行验证。

Result: 分析发现，现有TRSLAs在某些特定传感器对故障时存在隐藏脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该框架具有长期价值，可用于客观评估现有或未来TRSLAs的鲁棒性。

Abstract: As the field of sparse arrays progressed, numerous array designs have been
introduced with a focus on larger apertures and higher degrees of freedom
(DOFs), resulting in maximally economic sparse arrays (MESAs) that operate with
the least number of sensors required to provide a given aperture while ensuring
a hole-free difference coarray (DCA). Consequently, MESAs are least robust to
sensor failures and cannot afford the failure of even a single sensor.
Multifold redundant sparse arrays (MFRSAs) provide a practical solution to the
problem of sensor failures in sparse arrays by making sure that the array
contains enough sensor pairs necessary to produce each spatial lag multiple
times. Owing to this property, a \b{eta}-fold redundant array can withstand
simultaneous failure of at least \b{eta}-1 sensors without losing the hole-free
DCA property. Nevertheless, MFRSAs are also prone to hidden dependencies that
prevent them from being fully robust. In this work, we present a systematic
framework to evaluate the robustness of triple redundant sparse linear arrays
(TRSLAs) against all possible two-sensor failures. After detailing the proposed
approach, we present the failure analysis of representative TRSLAs available in
existing literature. It is found that existing TRSLAs have some hidden
vulnerabilities against the failure of some peculiar sensor pairs.
Corresponding MATLAB programs and numerical simulations are provided for
evaluation and use by the array processing community. The proposed approach has
a great archival value as it can evaluate the robustness of any present or
future TRSLAs through objective means.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for integrated communication and computing (ICC)
transceiver design in time-varying millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels. In
particular, in order to cope with the dynamics of time-varying mmWave channels,
the detection of communication symbols and the execution of an over-the-air
computing (AirComp) operation are performed in parallel with channel tracking,
as opposed to existing state-of-the-art (SotA) on ICC where perfect knowledge
of the channel at all time instances is typically assumed. For clarity of
exposition, we consider a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) uplink scenario
where multiple single-antenna user equipment (UE) transmit to a base station
(BS) equipped with multiple antennas, such that each UE, or edge device (ED),
precodes its own transmit signal, while the BS, or access points (APs), also
performs receive beamforming. The proposed transceiver framework then estimates
channel state information (CSI) and data symbols in parallel, using a bilinear
Gaussian belief propagation (BiGaBP) algorithm for joint channel and data
detection (JCDE), aided by a channel prediction (CP) algorithm executed before
each estimation window at the BS. The AirComp operation is then executed by
means of an optimal combination of the residual signal. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in performing ICC in
challenging time-varying mmWave channels, with minimal degradation to both
communication and computing performance.

Abstract: In wireless sensor networks for reusable launchers, the electromagnetic
characterization and electromagnetic compatibility analyses are relevant due to
the reference operational scenario, which implies a complex, and sometimes
dynamic, electromagnetic environment. This work proposes a methodological
framework for the design of the network and for the analysis of the related
electromagnetic environment within the stages of a given launcher. Based on the
preliminary positioning of the network nodes, the framework prescribes a
workflow and the related toolset for determining the optimal network topology
focusing on the weights, the operation of the transceivers, and the overall
radiated power. The optimal network configuration is simulated by using
computational electromagnetics strategies in order to assess the
electromagnetic environment induced by the sensor network itself. The paper
provides some results concerning a case study for a specific launcher.

Conclusion: 可移动天线阵列为未来超密集卫星网络提供了一种高效的干扰缓解方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new architecture for the low-earth orbit (LEO)
satellite ground station aided by movable antenna (MA) array. Unlike
conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the MA array can flexibly adjust
antenna positions to reconfigure array geometry, for more effectively
mitigating interference and improving communication performance in ultra-dense
LEO satellite networks. To reduce movement overhead, we configure antenna
positions at the antenna initialization stage, which remain unchanged during
the whole communication period of the ground station. To this end, an
optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average achievable rate of
the ground station by jointly optimizing its antenna position vector (APV) and
time-varying beamforming weights, i.e., antenna weight vectors (AWVs). To solve
the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we adopt the Lagrangian dual
transformation and quadratic transformation to reformulate the objective
function into a more tractable form. Then, we develop an efficient block
coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes the APV
and AWVs until convergence is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that our
proposed MA scheme significantly outperforms traditional FPA by increasing the
achievable rate at ground stations under various system setups, thus providing
an efficient solution for interference mitigation in future ultra-dense LEO
satellite communication networks.

Abstract: In this work, we propose the design of modulation schemes that improve the

is solved using the epsilon-constraint method and optimized constellations are
designed for various energy harvesting thresholds. We then evaluate the
performance of the optimized constellations under three different fluid antenna

Random Port. Our simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains
of optimized constellations over conventional constellations in both
information rate and energy harvesting.

Abstract: This paper proposes and experimentally evaluates a joint clock recovery (CR)
and equalization architecture tailored for high-speed sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
wireless communication links. Specifically, a Baud-spaced digital receiver
architecture is investigated that combines a constant modulus algorithm (CMA)
equalizer with a blind timing error detector (TED), enabling robust symbol
timing synchronization without decision-directed (DD) feedback or pilot
symbols. The proposed TED leverages the CMA filter coefficients to estimate
timing errors, which are then used to drive a Farrow interpolator operating at
twice the symbol rate. The system is validated experimentally using a 140~GHz
wireless testbed with 16-QAM modulation over a 10~GHz bandwidth. Results show
that the proposed TED schemes outperform conventional blind TEDs, such as
Gardner and blind implementations of Mueller \& M\"uller, in terms of bit error
rate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM), and intersymbol interference (ISI)
suppression. These capabilities are especially relevant to next-generation
spaceborne communication systems, where wideband sub-THz links are expected to
play a key role in enabling ultra-high-data-rate inter-satellite and deep-space
communications under challenging synchronization constraints.

as demonstrated on a synthetic channel dataset representing an urban macrocell

Abstract: Autonomous multi-finger grasping is a fundamental capability in robotic
manipulation. Optimization-based approaches show strong performance, but tend
to be sensitive to initialization and are potentially time-consuming. As an
alternative, the generator-evaluator-planner framework has been proposed. A
generator generates grasp candidates, an evaluator ranks the proposed grasps,
and a motion planner plans a trajectory to the highest-ranked grasp. If the
planner doesn't find a trajectory, a new trajectory optimization is started
with the next-best grasp as the target and so on. However, executing
lower-ranked grasps means a lower chance of grasp success, and multiple
trajectory optimizations are time-consuming. Alternatively, relaxing the
threshold for motion planning accuracy allows for easier computation of a
successful trajectory but implies lower accuracy in estimating grasp success
likelihood. It's a lose-lose proposition: either spend more time finding a
successful trajectory or have a worse estimate of grasp success. We propose a
framework that plans trajectories to a set of generated grasp targets in
parallel, the evaluator estimates the grasp success likelihood of the resulting
trajectories, and the robot executes the trajectory most likely to succeed. To
plan trajectories to different targets efficiently, we propose the use of a
vectorized motion planner. Our experiments show our approach improves over the
traditional generator-evaluator-planner framework across different objects,
generators, and motion planners, and successfully generalizes to novel
environments in the real world, including different shelves and table heights.

Conclusion: 该工作为机器人运动学优化建立了量子原生框架，有效连接了量子计算与机器人学问题。

Abstract: Optimizing high-degree of freedom robotic manipulators requires searching
complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces, a task that is computationally
challenging for classical methods. This paper introduces a quantum native
framework that integrates quantum machine learning with Grover's algorithm to
solve kinematic optimization problems efficiently. A parameterized quantum
circuit is trained to approximate the forward kinematics model, which then
constructs an oracle to identify optimal configurations. Grover's algorithm
leverages this oracle to provide a quadratic reduction in search complexity.
Demonstrated on 1-DoF, 2-DoF, and dual-arm manipulator tasks, the method
achieves significant speedups-up to 93x over classical optimizers like Nelder
Mead as problem dimensionality increases. This work establishes a foundational,
quantum-native framework for robot kinematic optimization, effectively bridging
quantum computing and robotics problems.

Motivation: 现有的动态环境局部规划器大多依赖经验性鲁棒性而非对动态障碍物的正式分析，因此需要一种更可靠的方法来处理动态障碍物。

Conclusion: dynamic gap通过正式分析动态障碍物并结合间隙传播算法，显著提升了动态环境导航的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: This chapter extends the family of perception-informed gap-based local
planners to dynamic environments. Existing perception-informed local planners
that operate in dynamic environments often rely on emergent or empirical
robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of
dynamic obstacles. This proposed planner, dynamic gap, explicitly addresses
dynamic obstacles through several steps in the planning pipeline. First, polar
regions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are
estimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time.
Then, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap
propagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage.
Lastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories
that are provably collision-free under ideal conditions. Additionally,
obstacle-centric ungap processing is performed in situations where no gaps
exist to robustify the overall planning framework. A set of gap-based planners
are benchmarked against a series of classical and learned motion planners in
dynamic environments, and dynamic gap is shown to outperform all other
baselines in all environments. Furthermore, dynamic gap is deployed on a
TurtleBot2 platform in several real-world experiments to validate collision
avoidance behaviors.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of a point-cloud-based navigation

by analyzing the results of 30,000 planning and navigation trials in simulation
and validated through field testing. Our simulation campaign considers three
kinematically challenging terrain maps and twenty combinations of seven
path-planning parameters. In simulation, our MUONS-equipped AGV achieved a 0.98
success rate and experienced no failures in the field. By statistical and
correlation analysis we determined that the Bi-RRT expansion radius used in the
initial planning stages is most correlated with performance in terms of
planning time and traversed path length. Finally, we observed that the
proportional variation due to changes in the tuning parameters is remarkably
well correlated to performance in field testing. This finding supports the use
of Monte-Carlo simulation campaigns for performance assessment and parameter
tuning.

Abstract: Accurate visual localization in dense urban environments poses a fundamental
task in photogrammetry, geospatial information science, and robotics. While
imagery is a low-cost and widely accessible sensing modality, its effectiveness
on visual odometry is often limited by textureless surfaces, severe viewpoint
changes, and long-term drift. The growing public availability of airborne laser
scanning (ALS) data opens new avenues for scalable and precise visual
localization by leveraging ALS as a prior map. However, the potential of
ALS-based localization remains underexplored due to three key limitations: (1)
the lack of platform-diverse datasets, (2) the absence of reliable ground-truth
generation methods applicable to large-scale urban environments, and (3)
limited validation of existing Image-to-Point Cloud (I2P) algorithms under
aerial-ground cross-platform settings. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce a new large-scale dataset that integrates ground-level imagery from
mobile mapping systems with ALS point clouds collected in Wuhan, Hong Kong, and
San Francisco.

Abstract: Traditional online Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods often suffer from
excessive computational complexity, limiting their practical deployment.
Explicit MPC mitigates online computational load by pre-computing control
policies offline; however, existing explicit MPC methods typically rely on
simplified system dynamics and cost functions, restricting their accuracy for
complex systems. This paper proposes TransMPC, a novel Transformer-based
explicit MPC algorithm capable of generating highly accurate control sequences
in real-time for complex dynamic systems. Specifically, we formulate the MPC
policy as an encoder-only Transformer leveraging bidirectional self-attention,
enabling simultaneous inference of entire control sequences in a single forward
pass. This design inherently accommodates variable prediction horizons while
ensuring low inference latency. Furthermore, we introduce a direct policy
optimization framework that alternates between sampling and learning phases.
Unlike imitation-based approaches dependent on precomputed optimal
trajectories, TransMPC directly optimizes the true finite-horizon cost via
automatic differentiation. Random horizon sampling combined with a replay
buffer provides independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training
samples, ensuring robust generalization across varying states and horizon
lengths. Extensive simulations and real-world vehicle control experiments
validate the effectiveness of TransMPC in terms of solution accuracy,
adaptability to varying horizons, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has attracted great interest due to its potential
capability in full-unsupervised driving. Model-based and learning-based methods
are widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined
models of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal
policy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the
above limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However,
existing PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training
efficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are
equivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper
develops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a
risk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a
safety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting
areas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO.
The balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding
vehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during
training. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold
channel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images.
Moreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions
with risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation
results on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
outperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak
reward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky
areas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios.

Abstract: Service robots have demonstrated significant potential for autonomous trolley
collection and redistribution in public spaces like airports or warehouses to
improve efficiency and reduce cost. Usually, a fully autonomous system for the
collection and transportation of multiple trolleys is based on a
Leader-Follower formation of mobile manipulators, where reliable docking
maneuvers of the mobile base are essential to align trolleys into organized
queues. However, developing a vision-based robotic docking system faces
significant challenges: high precision requirements, environmental
disturbances, and inherent robot constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose an optimization-based Visual Servoing scheme that incorporates active
infrared markers for robust feature extraction across diverse lighting
conditions. This framework explicitly models nonholonomic kinematics and
visibility constraints within the Hybrid Visual Servoing problem, augmented
with an observer for disturbance rejection to ensure precise and stable
docking. Experimental results across diverse environments demonstrate the
robustness of this system, with quantitative evaluations confirming high
docking accuracy.

Abstract: In time-critical settings such as assistive driving, assistants often rely on
alerts or haptic signals to prompt rapid human attention, but these cues
usually leave humans to interpret situations and decide responses
independently, introducing potential delays or ambiguity in meaning.
Language-based assistive systems can instead provide instructions backed by
context, offering more informative guidance. However, current approaches (e.g.,
social assistive robots) largely prioritize content generation while
overlooking critical timing factors such as verbal conveyance duration, human
comprehension delays, and subsequent follow-through duration. These timing
considerations are crucial in time-critical settings, where even minor delays
can substantially affect outcomes. We aim to study this inherent trade-off
between timeliness and informativeness by framing the challenge as a sequential
decision-making problem using an augmented-state Markov Decision Process. We
design a framework combining reinforcement learning and a generated offline
taxonomy dataset, where we balance the trade-off while enabling a scalable
taxonomy dataset generation pipeline. Empirical evaluation with synthetic
humans shows our framework improves success rates by over 40% compared to
methods that ignore time delays, while effectively balancing timeliness and
informativeness. It also exposes an often-overlooked trade-off between these
two factors, opening new directions for optimizing communication in
time-critical human-AI assistance.

Motivation: 现有研究中缺乏对触觉感知的关注，而触觉对人类灵活性至关重要。本文旨在利用LLM设计奖励函数，结合触觉感知，提升机器人操作的灵活性和效率。

Method: 提出Text2Touch方法，通过提示工程扩展到70多个环境变量，并利用仿真到现实的蒸馏技术，将策略迁移到具有触觉功能的机器人手上。

Result: Text2Touch在旋转速度和稳定性上显著优于人工设计的基线，同时奖励函数更简洁。

Conclusion: LLM设计的奖励函数可以显著缩短从概念到可部署技能的开发时间，支持更快、可扩展的多模态机器人学习。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to automate reward design for
dexterous manipulation. However, no prior work has considered tactile sensing,
which is known to be critical for human-like dexterity. We present Text2Touch,
bringing LLM-crafted rewards to the challenging task of multi-axis in-hand
object rotation with real-world vision based tactile sensing in palm-up and
palm-down configurations. Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70
environment variables, and sim-to-real distillation enables successful policy
transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot
hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully tuned human-engineered
baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability while relying on
reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler. These
results illustrate how LLM-designed rewards can significantly reduce the time
from concept to deployable dexterous tactile skills, supporting more rapid and
scalable multimodal robot learning. Project website:

Conclusion: LiDAR引导的RGB合成有助于增强机器人在真实环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在不依赖准确轨迹预测的情况下，成功平衡了安全性与驾驶效率。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must navigate dynamically uncertain environments while
balancing the safety and driving efficiency. This challenge is exacerbated by
the unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and
perception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving
uncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners
degrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter
serious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected
maneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency
trajectory optimization framework in this paper. By employing event-triggered
online learning of HV control-intent sets, our method dynamically quantifies
multi-modal HV uncertainties and refines the forward reachable set (FRS)
incrementally. Crucially, we enforce invariant safety through FRS-based barrier
constraints that ensure safety without reliance on accurate trajectory
prediction of HVs. These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory
optimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction
method of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the
uncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without
resorting to excessive conservatism. High-fidelity simulations on highway and
urban scenarios, as well as a series of real-world experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in driving efficiency and passenger comfort while
maintaining safety under uncertainty. The project page is available at

Abstract: Birds in nature perform perching not only for rest but also for interaction
with human such as the relationship with falconers. Recently, researchers
achieve perching-capable aerial robots as a way to save energy, and deformable
structure demonstrate significant advantages in efficiency of perching and
compactness of configuration. However, ensuring flight stability remains
challenging for deformable aerial robots due to the difficulty of controlling
flexible arms. Furthermore, perching for human interaction requires high
compliance along with safety. Thus, this study aims to develop a deformable
aerial robot capable of perching on humans with high flexibility and grasping
ability. To overcome the challenges of stability of both flight and perching,
we propose a hybrid morphing structure that combines a unilateral flexible arm
and a pneumatic inflatable actuators. This design allows the robot's arms to
remain rigid during flight and soft while perching for more effective grasping.
We also develop a pneumatic control system that optimizes pressure regulation
while integrating shock absorption and adjustable grasping forces, enhancing
interaction capabilities and energy efficiency. Besides, we focus on the
structural characteristics of the unilateral flexible arm and identify
sufficient conditions under which standard quadrotor modeling and control
remain effective in terms of flight stability. Finally, the developed prototype
demonstrates the feasibility of compliant perching maneuvers on humans, as well
as the robust recovery even after arm deformation caused by thrust reductions
during flight. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to achieve
an aerial robot capable of perching on humans for interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在光学、几何和语义捕捉上存在不足，如模糊、不规则和歧义，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 采用3DGS-Voxel混合表示，结合自适应相机建模、混合增量表示和概率融合等技术。

Result: 实验显示，OmniMap在渲染保真度、几何精度和零样本语义分割上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OmniMap的多样性支持多种下游应用，展现了综合感知框架的潜力。

Abstract: Robotic systems demand accurate and comprehensive 3D environment perception,
requiring simultaneous capture of photo-realistic appearance (optical), precise
layout shape (geometric), and open-vocabulary scene understanding (semantic).
Existing methods typically achieve only partial fulfillment of these
requirements while exhibiting optical blurring, geometric irregularities, and
semantic ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMap. Overall,
OmniMap represents the first online mapping framework that simultaneously
captures optical, geometric, and semantic scene attributes while maintaining
real-time performance and model compactness. At the architectural level,
OmniMap employs a tightly coupled 3DGS-Voxel hybrid representation that
combines fine-grained modeling with structural stability. At the implementation
level, OmniMap identifies key challenges across different modalities and
introduces several innovations: adaptive camera modeling for motion blur and
exposure compensation, hybrid incremental representation with normal
constraints, and probabilistic fusion for robust instance-level understanding.
Extensive experiments show OmniMap's superior performance in rendering
fidelity, geometric accuracy, and zero-shot semantic segmentation compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes. The framework's versatility is
further evidenced through a variety of downstream applications, including
multi-domain scene Q&A, interactive editing, perception-guided manipulation,
and map-assisted navigation.

Conclusion: 基于机器学习的自碰撞检测方法在速度和精度上优于传统方法，位置编码的引入进一步优化了模型性能。

Abstract: This manuscript investigates the integration of positional encoding -- a
technique widely used in computer graphics -- into the input vector of a binary
classification model for self-collision detection. The results demonstrate the
benefits of incorporating positional encoding, which enhances classification
accuracy by enabling the model to better capture high-frequency variations,
leading to a more detailed and precise representation of complex collision
patterns. The manuscript shows that machine learning-based techniques, such as
lightweight multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) operating in a low-dimensional
feature space, offer a faster alternative for collision checking than
traditional methods that rely on geometric approaches, such as
triangle-to-triangle intersection tests and Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH)
for mesh-based models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于SSD-Mamba2的跨模态强化学习框架，用于高效的运动控制，通过选择性状态空间技术实现低延迟和长距离依赖，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的运动控制器多为盲控或计算-内存效率低的融合框架，递归控制器因长时程信用分配困难表现不佳，而Transformer的成本随token长度呈二次增长。因此需要一种更高效的融合框架。

Method: 采用SSD-Mamba2作为主干网络，结合选择性状态空间技术，将本体感知和外感知观察编码为紧凑token，通过堆叠SSD-Mamba2层进行融合。通过随机化和渐进增加的课程学习训练端到端策略。

Result: 在多运动控制场景中，该方法在回报、安全性（碰撞和摔倒）和样本效率上均优于基线，且在相同计算预算下收敛更快。

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2是一种高效、前瞻性强且可扩展的端到端运动控制融合框架。

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

Abstract: In robots task and motion planning (TAMP), it is crucial to sample within the
robot's configuration space to meet task-level global constraints and enhance
the efficiency of subsequent motion planning. Due to the complexity of joint
configuration sampling under multi-level constraints, traditional methods often
lack efficiency. This paper introduces the principle of RobKiNet, a
kinematics-informed neural network, for end-to-end sampling within the
Continuous Feasible Set (CFS) under multiple constraints in configuration
space, establishing its Optimization Expectation Model. Comparisons with
traditional sampling and learning-based approaches reveal that RobKiNet's
kinematic knowledge infusion enhances training efficiency by ensuring stable
and accurate gradient optimization.Visualizations and quantitative analyses in
a 2-DOF space validate its theoretical efficiency, while its application on a
9-DOF autonomous mobile manipulator robot(AMMR) demonstrates superior
whole-body and decoupled control, excelling in battery disassembly tasks.
RobKiNet outperforms deep reinforcement learning with a training speed 74.29
times faster and a sampling accuracy of up to 99.25%, achieving a 97.33% task
completion rate in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient exploration of unknown environments is crucial for autonomous
robots, especially in confined and large-scale scenarios with limited
communication. To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative
exploration framework for a marsupial ground-aerial robot team that leverages
the complementary capabilities of both platforms. The framework employs a
graph-based path planning algorithm to guide exploration and deploy the aerial
robot in areas where its expected gain significantly exceeds that of the ground
robot, such as large open spaces or regions inaccessible to the ground
platform, thereby maximizing coverage and efficiency. To facilitate large-scale
spatial information sharing, we introduce a bandwidth-efficient, task-driven
map compression strategy. This method enables each robot to reconstruct
resolution-specific volumetric maps while preserving exploration-critical
details, even at high compression rates. By selectively compressing and sharing
key data, communication overhead is minimized, ensuring effective map
integration for collaborative path planning. Simulation and real-world
experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in
improving exploration efficiency while significantly reducing data
transmission.

Abstract: Explainability is a critical tool in helping stakeholders understand robots.
In particular, the ability for robots to explain why they have made a
particular decision or behaved in a certain way is useful in this regard.
Behaviour trees are a popular framework for controlling the decision-making of
robots and other software systems, and thus a natural question to ask is
whether or not a system driven by a behaviour tree is capable of answering
"why" questions. While explainability for behaviour trees has seen some prior
attention, no existing methods are capable of generating causal, counterfactual
explanations which detail the reasons for robot decisions and behaviour.
Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel approach which automatically
generates counterfactual explanations in response to contrastive "why"
questions. Our method achieves this by first automatically building a causal
model from the structure of the behaviour tree as well as domain knowledge
about the state and individual behaviour tree nodes. The resultant causal model
is then queried and searched to find a set of diverse counterfactual
explanations. We demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly explain the
behaviour of a wide range of behaviour tree structures and states. By being
able to answer a wide range of causal queries, our approach represents a step
towards more transparent, understandable and ultimately trustworthy robotic
systems.

Abstract: This study presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based control
framework aimed at enhancing the safety and robustness of the quadcopter, with
a specific focus on resilience to in-flight one propeller failure. Addressing
the critical need of a robust control strategy for maintaining a desired
altitude for the quadcopter to safe the hardware and the payload in physical
applications. The proposed framework investigates two RL methodologies Dynamic
Programming (DP) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to overcome the
challenges posed by the rotor failure mechanism of the quadcopter. DP, a
model-based approach, is leveraged for its convergence guarantees, despite high
computational demands, whereas DDPG, a model-free technique, facilitates rapid
computation but with constraints on solution duration. The research challenge
arises from training RL algorithms on large dimensions and action domains. With
modifications to the existing DP and DDPG algorithms, the controllers were
trained not only to cater for large continuous state and action domain and also
achieve a desired state after an inflight propeller failure. To verify the
robustness of the proposed control framework, extensive simulations were
conducted in a MATLAB environment across various initial conditions and
underscoring its viability for mission-critical quadcopter applications. A
comparative analysis was performed between both RL algorithms and their
potential for applications in faulty aerial systems.

Conclusion: SPERO通过技术创新解决了旋停飞行器的长期挑战，为相关领域提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Stop-rotor aircraft have long been proposed as the ideal vertical takeoff and
landing (VTOL) aircraft for missions with equal time spent in both flight
regimes, such as agricultural monitoring, search and rescue, and last-mile
delivery. Featuring a central lifting surface that rotates in VTOL to generate
vertical thrust and locks in forward flight to generate passive lift, the
stop-rotor offers the potential for high efficiency across both modes. However,
practical implementation has remained infeasible due to aerodynamic and
stability conflicts between flight modes. In this work, we present SPERO
(Stopped-Penta Rotor), a stop-rotor uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a
flipping and latching wing, an active center of pressure mechanism, thrust
vectored counterbalances, a five-rotor architecture, and an eleven-state
machine flight controller coordinating geometric and controller
reconfiguration. Furthermore, SPERO establishes a generalizable design and
control framework for stopped-rotor UAVs. Together, these innovations overcome
longstanding challenges in stop-rotor flight and enable the first stable,
bidirectional transition between VTOL and forward flight.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating in unstructured environments require the ability to
switch between compliant and rigid states to perform diverse tasks such as
adaptive grasping, high-force manipulation, shape holding, and navigation in
constrained spaces, among others. However, many existing variable stiffness
solutions rely on complex actuation schemes, continuous input power, or
monolithic designs, limiting their modularity and scalability. This paper
presents the Programmable Locking Cell (PLC)-a modular, tendon-driven unit that
achieves discrete stiffness modulation through mechanically interlocked joints
actuated by cable tension. Each unit transitions between compliant and firm
states via structural engagement, and the assembled system exhibits high
stiffness variation-up to 950% per unit-without susceptibility to damage under
high payload in the firm state. Multiple PLC units can be assembled into
reconfigurable robotic structures with spatially programmable stiffness. We
validate the design through two functional prototypes: (1) a variable-stiffness
gripper capable of adaptive grasping, firm holding, and in-hand manipulation;
and (2) a pipe-traversing robot composed of serial PLC units that achieves
shape adaptability and stiffness control in confined environments. These
results demonstrate the PLC as a scalable, structure-centric mechanism for
programmable stiffness and motion, enabling robotic systems with reconfigurable
morphology and task-adaptive interaction.

Abstract: Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on
large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich,
deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,
even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency
of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.
To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on
human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we
fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate
recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human
operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot
back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective
segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition
expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,
which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on
long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt
hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated
assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less
data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time
scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the
number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are
available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低层级轨迹复制方法在泛化性上表现不佳，GF-VLA旨在通过任务级推理直接处理人类演示。

Method: 采用信息论提取关键交互，构建时态场景图，结合语言条件变换器生成行为树和运动基元。

Conclusion: GF-VLA能有效泛化并提升双臂机器人的任务执行能力，适用于多样化的空间和语义变化。

Abstract: Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a
significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level
trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects,
spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we
introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that
enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution
directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an
information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively
highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues
are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently
integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance
efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy
that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit
geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly
benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial
generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation
achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the
language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When
deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89%
placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking,
letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong
generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型无法处理物理力反馈信号（如扭矩），限制了其在机器人操控任务中的表现。

Method: 研究了扭矩信号的融入策略，包括在解码器中引入扭矩适配器，并提出通过辅助输出来预测扭矩的方法。

Result: 实验表明解码器引入扭矩适配器优于编码器，且预测扭矩的辅助输出进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 扭矩感知模型显著提升了物理交互任务的表现，为机器人操控提供了更精确的力反馈集成方法。

Abstract: Many robotic manipulation tasks require sensing and responding to force
signals such as torque to assess whether the task has been successfully
completed and to enable closed-loop control. However, current
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle
physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to
bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating
torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate
several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque
adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the
encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in
autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which
further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a
physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation
benchmarks validate our findings.

Abstract: We present a learning-based outlier-robust filter for a general setup where
the measurement noise can be correlated. Since it is an enhanced version of
EM-based outlier robust filter (EMORF), we call it as EMORF-II. As it is
equipped with an additional powerful feature to learn the outlier
characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has
improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm
performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy with an increased computational overhead. However, thankfully the
computational complexity order remains at par with other practical methods
making it a useful choice for diverse applications.

TL;DR: TCGRE将多智能体路径规划中的主动协作问题转化为3D匹配问题，提出分解方法（JSG、CES、RHOCA*）和动态图构建（Dynamic-HJSG），在保证最优性的同时降低计算复杂度。


<details>

Motivation: 传统MAPF仅关注避碰，但实际应用中需要智能体主动协作以提升团队性能。

Method: 1. 将TCGRE建模为3D匹配问题；2. 提出JSG、CES、RHOCA*三种分解方法；3. 扩展版引入动态图构建（Dynamic-HJSG）。

Result: Dynamic-HJSG在关键情况下将复杂度从指数降至多项式，实证显示其在大规模团队和图中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TCGRE为协作路径规划提供了理论框架，其思想可扩展至其他协作优化问题。

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) traditionally focuses on collision avoidance,
but many real-world applications require active coordination between agents to
improve team performance. This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs
with Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on
high-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D
matching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and
rigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To
address this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient
decomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems:
Joint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path
problem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments
via exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*):
Balances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in
this extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method
(Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and
reduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph
dynamically. Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while
lowering complexity from exponential to polynomial in key cases. Empirical
results validate scalability for large teams and graphs, with HJSG
outperforming baselines greatly in runtime in different sizes and types of
graphs. This work bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning,
offering a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable
guarantees, and the key idea of the solution can be widely extended to many
other collaborative optimization problems, such as MAPF.

Result: 仿真结果表明，CEGT在碰撞率、安全距离、速度和整体性能上优于EGT及其他基准博弈方法。

Conclusion: EGT框架结合CEGT模块有效解决了AV交互中的挑战，提升了安全性和效率。

Abstract: Modern transportation systems face significant challenges in ensuring road
safety, given serious injuries caused by road accidents. The rapid growth of
autonomous vehicles (AVs) has prompted new traffic designs that aim to optimize
interactions among AVs. However, effective interactions between AVs remains
challenging due to the absence of centralized control. Besides, there is a need
for balancing multiple factors, including passenger demands and overall traffic
efficiency. Traditional rule-based, optimization-based, and game-theoretic
approaches each have limitations in addressing these challenges. Rule-based
methods struggle with adaptability and generalization in complex scenarios,
while optimization-based methods often require high computational resources.
Game-theoretic approaches, such as Stackelberg and Nash games, suffer from
limited adaptability and potential inefficiencies in cooperative settings. This
paper proposes an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)-based framework for AV
interactions that overcomes these limitations by utilizing a decentralized and
adaptive strategy evolution mechanism. A causal evaluation module (CEGT) is
introduced to optimize the evolutionary rate, balancing mutation and evolution
by learning from historical interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the
proposed CEGT outperforms EGT and popular benchmark games in terms of lower
collision rates, improved safety distances, higher speeds, and overall better
performance compared to Nash and Stackelberg games across diverse scenarios and
parameter settings.

Result: 交叉抑制机制在偏见条件下表现更优，决策更快、更准确、更具鲁棒性和扩展性。

Conclusion: 交叉抑制机制为微型机器人群体提供了更优的协调方法，适用于广泛的分散决策系统。

Abstract: Minimalistic robot swarms offer a scalable, robust, and cost-effective
approach to performing complex tasks with the potential to transform
applications in healthcare, disaster response, and environmental monitoring.
However, coordinating such decentralised systems remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly when robots are constrained in communication,
computation, and memory. In our study, individual robots frequently make errors
when sensing the environment, yet the swarm can rapidly and reliably reach
consensus on the best among $n$ discrete options. We compare two canonical
mechanisms of opinion dynamics -- direct-switch and cross-inhibition -- which
are simple yet effective rules for collective information processing observed
in biological systems across scales, from neural populations to insect
colonies. We generalise the existing mean-field models by considering asocial
biases influencing the opinion dynamics. While swarms using direct-switch
reliably select the best option in absence of asocial dynamics, their
performance deteriorates once such biases are introduced, often resulting in
decision deadlocks. In contrast, bio-inspired cross-inhibition enables faster,
more cohesive, accurate, robust, and scalable decisions across a wide range of
biased conditions. Our findings provide theoretical and practical insights into
the coordination of minimal swarms and offer insights that extend to a broad
class of decentralised decision-making systems in biology and engineering.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决多频段量子接收器中不同用户信号的光学中频干扰问题，提升通信效率。

Method: 提出了RAQ-MIMO架构，利用量子跨导模型和qWMMSE算法联合优化量子本振配置和经典预编码/合并矩阵。

Conclusion: RAQ-MIMO系统通过消除经典天线间的互耦效应，为多频段量子通信提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) are capable of receiving multi-band
radio-frequency (RF) signals simultaneously, which are expected to break Chu's
limit for classical electronic antennas. However, signals from different users
will interfere with each other in the optical intermediate frequency (IF)
domain of the multi-band quantum receiver, which is termed the IF interference
(IFI) problem. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQ-MIMO)
by exploiting the additional spatial diversity of MIMO receivers. Specifically,
by applying the dynamic signal model of RAQRs, we clarify the physical
relationship between the quantum local oscillator (LO) configurations and the
multi-band gains with the concept of quantum transconductance. Then, with the
quantum transconductance-based signal model, we formulate the spectral
efficiency (SE) maximization problem and further propose the quantum weighted
minimum mean square error (qWMMSE) algorithm, which jointly optimizes the
quantum LO configurations and the classical precoder/combiner matrices.
Furthermore, we test the qWMMSE algorithm within the standard space division
multiple access (SDMA) scheme and the frequency division multiple access (FDMA)
scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the qWMMSE optimization framework
can significantly improve the SE of RAQ-MIMO systems for both multiple access
schemes, and that RAQ-MIMO systems can outperform classical electronic
receiver-based multi-user MIMO systems by eliminating the mutual coupling
effect between classical antennas.

Conclusion: HR-XPD提供了一种无需造影剂的高效、高分辨率微血管成像方法，适用于临床和临床前研究。

Abstract: Microvascular imaging has advanced significantly with ultrafast data
acquisition and improved clutter filtering, enhancing the sensitivity of power
Doppler imaging to small vessels. However, the image quality remains limited by
spatial resolution and elevated background noise, both of which impede
visualization and accurate quantification. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a high-resolution cross-correlation Power Doppler (HR-XPD)
method that integrates spatial radiality weighting with Doppler signal
coherence analysis, thereby enhancing spatial resolution while suppressing
artifacts and background noise. Quantitative evaluations in simulation and in
vivo experiments on healthy human liver, transplanted human kidney, and pig
kidney demonstrated that HR-XPD significantly improves microvascular
resolvability and contrast compared to conventional PD. In vivo results showed
up to a 2 to 3-fold enhancement in spatial resolution and an increase in
contrast by up to 20 dB. High-resolution vascular details were clearly depicted
within a short acquisition time of only 0.3 s-1.2 s without the use of contrast
agents. These findings indicate that HR-XPD provides an effective,
contrast-free, and high-resolution microvascular imaging approach with broad
applicability in both preclinical and clinical research.

Conclusion: 公共蜂窝网络可有效替代传统铁路通信网络，芬兰案例验证了其可行性。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using public cellular networks for specialized
communication applications, replacing standalone sector-specific networks. One
such application is transitioning from the aging GSM-R railway network to
public 4G and 5G networks. Finland is modernizing its railway communication
system through the Digirail project, leveraging public cellular networks. To
evaluate network performance, a nationwide measurement campaign was conducted
in two modes: Best Quality and Packet Replication. However, Best Quality mode
introduces artificial delays, making it unsuitable for real-world assessments.
In this paper, railway network delays are modeled using machine learning based
on measurements from the Packet Replication mode. The best-performing model is
then employed to generate a dataset estimating network delays across Finland's
railway network. This dataset provides a more accurate representation of
network performance. Machine learning based network performance prediction is
shown to be feasible, and the results indicate that Finland's public cellular
network can meet the stringent performance requirements of railway network
control.

Conclusion: 传感器管理在多阶段随机控制问题中具有重要作用，动态规划方法虽计算成本高，但仍能通过小规模示例揭示其潜力。

Abstract: Technological advancements in miniaturization and wireless communications are
yielding more affordable and versatile sensors and, in turn, more applications
in which a network of sensors can be actively managed to best support overall
decision-making objectives. We propose modeling the opportunity for sensor
management within multi-stage stochastic control problems with imperfect state
information. Such formulations inherently assume the state of the modeled
environment cannot be accessed directly but instead the controller can observe
only noisy measurements of the state and, therefore, at each decision stage
some form of state estimation is required before a control is actuated. The
notion of sensor management arises when the modeled controls not only affect
the subsequent evolution of the state but can also affect the nature of future
measurements and, hence, the quality of state estimates that drive future
control decisions. In principle, the optimal strategy for any appropriately
modeled multi-stage stochastic control problem with imperfect state information
(with or without opportunity for sensor management) is the solution to a
dynamic program; in practice, the computational requirements are typically
prohibitive yet dynamic programming methods are still useful to guide the
development of effective suboptimal strategies. In this spirit, we model the
opportunity for sensor management within small-scale examples of two
well-studied dynamic programming formulations, namely (1) the
finite-state/finite-action Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process
(PO-MDP) and (2) the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian Regulator (LQGR). These examples
admit solvable dynamic programs and confirm how the interplay between sensing
and acting is a natural by-product of a dynamic programming solution.

Motivation: 随着社交机器人更深入地融入日常生活，人们期望它们能够进行有意义的对话并表现出社会情感智能的倾听行为，以增强人机互动效果。

Method: 开发了一种能够根据上下文情感进行积极倾听和反馈行为的LLM社交机器人，并与仅反馈行为的机器人和无倾听行为的机器人进行对比实验。

Conclusion: 在社交机器人中实现积极倾听行为有助于改善人机交流，并进一步促进更深层次的人机关系和情感连接。

Abstract: As social robots get more deeply integrated intoour everyday lives, they will
be expected to engage in meaningful conversations and exhibit socio-emotionally
intelligent listening behaviors when interacting with people. Active listening
and backchanneling could be one way to enhance robots' communicative
capabilities and enhance their effectiveness in eliciting deeper
self-disclosure, providing a sense of empathy,and forming positive rapport and
relationships with people.Thus, we developed an LLM-powered social robot that
can exhibit contextually appropriate sentiment-based backchannelingand active
listening behaviors (active listening+backchanneling) and compared its efficacy
in eliciting people's self-disclosurein comparison to robots that do not
exhibit any of these listening behaviors (control) and a robot that only
exhibitsbackchanneling behavior (backchanneling-only). Through ourexperimental
study with sixty-five participants, we found theparticipants who conversed with
the active listening robot per-ceived the interactions more positively, in
which they exhibited the highest self-disclosures, and reported the strongest
senseof being listened to. The results of our study suggest that the
implementation of active listening behaviors in social robotshas the potential
to improve human-robot communication andcould further contribute to the
building of deeper human-robot relationships and rapport.

Result: 提出机器人开发者应遵循的设计目标，以实现更道德和知情的人类-机器人互动。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考并设计社交机器人，以确保用户在互动中的知情同意和伦理合规性。

Abstract: Contemporary robots are increasingly mimicking human social behaviours to
facilitate interaction, such as smiling to signal approachability, or
hesitating before taking an action to allow people time to react. Such
techniques can activate a person's entrenched social instincts, triggering
emotional responses as though they are interacting with a fellow human, and can
prompt them to treat a robot as if it truly possesses the underlying life-like
processes it outwardly presents, raising significant ethical questions. We
engage these issues through the lens of informed consent: drawing upon
prevailing legal principles and ethics, we examine how social robots can
influence user behaviour in novel ways, and whether under those circumstances
users can be appropriately informed to consent to these heightened
interactions. We explore the complex circumstances of human-robot interaction
and highlight how it differs from more familiar interaction contexts, and we
apply legal principles relating to informed consent to social robots in order
to reconceptualize the current ethical debates surrounding the field. From this
investigation, we synthesize design goals for robot developers to achieve more
ethical and informed human-robot interaction.
