As a promising solution, physical layer security (PLS) technology leverages the inherent characteristics of wireless channels to provide security assurance. Particularly, stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) directly manipulates electromagnetic waves through their multilayer structures, offering significant potential for enhancing PLS performance in an energy efficient manner. Thus, in this work, we investigate an SIM-assisted secure communication system for MUs under the threat of an eavesdropper, addressing practical challenges such as channel uncertainty in mobile environments, multiple MU interference, and residual hardware impairments. Consequently, we formulate a joint power and phase shift optimization problem (JPPSOP), aiming at maximizing the achievable secrecy rate (ASR) of all MUs. Given the non-convexity and dynamic nature of this optimization problem, we propose an enhanced proximal policy optimization algorithm with a bidirectional long short-term memory mechanism, an off-policy data utilization mechanism, and a policy feedback mechanism (PPO-BOP). Through these mechanisms, the proposed algorithm can effectively capture short-term channel fading and long-term MU mobility, improve sample utilization efficiency, and enhance exploration capabilities. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that PPO-BOP significantly outperforms benchmark strategies and other deep reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of ASR.10.1109/TWC.2026.3658332"}

Most existing methods operate at the window level, facing a trade-off between temporal resolution and decoding accuracy. Recent work has shown that hidden Markov model (HMM)-based post-processing can smooth window-level decoder outputs to improve this trade-off. Instead of using a separate smoothing step, we propose to integrate the decoding and smoothing components into a single probabilistic framework using a Markov switching model (MSM). It directly models the relationship between the EEG and speech envelopes under each attention state while incorporating the temporal dynamics of attention. This formulation enables sample-level attention decoding, with model parameters and attention states jointly estimated via the expectation-maximization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated MSM formulation achieves comparable decoding accuracy to HMM post-processing while providing faster attention switch detection.

This interface has been challenging to sensorize due to manufacturing complexity and non-linear sensor responses. Here, we measure human limb-device interaction via fluidic innervation, creating a 3D-printed silicone pad with embedded air channels to measure forces. As forces are applied to the pad, the air channels compress, resulting in a pressure change measurable by off-the-shelf pressure transducers. We demonstrate in benchtop testing that pad pressure is highly linearly related to applied force ($R^2 = 0.998$). This is confirmed with clinical dynamometer correlations with isometric knee torque, where above-knee pressure was highly correlated with flexion torque ($R^2 = 0.95$), while below-knee pressure was highly correlated with extension torque ($R^2 = 0.75$). We build on these idealized settings to test pad performance in more unconstrained settings. We place the pad over \\textit{biceps brachii} during cyclic curls and stepwise isometric holds, observing a correlation between pressure and elbow angle. Finally, we integrated the sensor into the strap of a lower-extremity robotic exoskeleton and recorded pad pressure during repeated squats with the device unpowered.

Overall, our preliminary results suggest fluidic innervation is a readily customizable sensing modality with high signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for capturing human-machine mechanical interaction.

We propose DopplerGLRTNet, an amortized off-grid GLRT: a lightweight regressor predicts the continuous Doppler within a resolution cell from the whitened observation, and the detector outputs a single GLRT/NMF-like score given by the normalized matched-filter energy at the predicted Doppler.

We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction.

To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation.

Each sacrificial agent follows a straight-line trajectory toward an adversary and reports whether it was intercepted or survived. These binary outcomes are related to the pursuer's parameters through a geometric reachable-region (RR) model. Two formulations are introduced: a boundary-interception case, where capture occurs at the RR boundary, and an interior-interception case, which allows capture anywhere within it. The pursuer's parameters are inferred using a gradient-based multi-start optimization with custom loss functions tailored to each case.\n  Two trajectory-selection strategies are proposed for the sacrificial agents: a geometric heuristic that maximizes the spread of expected interception points, and a Bayesian experimental-design method that maximizes the D-score of the expected Gauss-Newton information matrix, thereby selecting trajectories that yield maximal information gain. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate accurate parameter recovery with five to twelve sacrificial agents. The learned engagement models are then used to generate safe, time-optimal paths for high-value agents that avoid all feasible pursuer engagement regions."}

However, the large XL-IRS aperture induces spherical wavefront propagation due to near-field (NF) effects, complicating cascaded channel estimation. Conventional dictionary-based methods suffer from cumulative quantization errors and high complexity, especially in uniform planar array (UPA) systems. To address these issues, we first propose a tensor modelization method for NF cascaded channels by exploiting the tensor product among the horizontal and vertical response vectors of the UPA-structured base station (BS) and the incident-reflective array response vector of the IRS. This structure leverages spatial characteristics, enabling independent estimation of factor matrices to improve efficiency. Meanwhile, to avoid quantization errors, we propose an off-grid cascaded channel estimation framework based on sparse Tucker decomposition. Specifically, we model the received signal as a Tucker tensor, where the sparse core tensor captures path gain-delay terms and three factor matrices are spanned by BS and NF IRS array responses. We then formulate a sparse core tensor minimization problem with tri-modal log-sum sparsity constraints to tackle the NP-hard challenge. Finally, the method is accelerated via higher-order singular value decomposition preprocessing, combined with majorization-minimization and a tailored tensor over-relaxation fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding technique. We derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound and conduct convergence analysis.

This paper revisits its sensing potential and presents WiRSSI, a bistatic WiFi sensing framework for passive human tracking using only RSSI measurements. WiRSSI adopts a 1Tx-3Rx configuration and is readily extensible to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) deployments. We first reveal how CSI power implicitly encodes phase-related information and how this relationship carries over to RSSI, showing that RSSI preserves exploitable Doppler, Angle-of-Arrival (AoA), and delay cues associated with human motion. WiRSSI then extracts Doppler-AoA features via a 2D Fast Fourier Transform and infers delay from amplitude-only information in the absence of subcarrier-level phase. The estimated AoA and delay are then mapped to Cartesian coordinates and denoised to recover motion trajectories. Experiments in practical environments show that WiRSSI achieves median XY localization errors of 0.905 m, 0.784 m, and 0.785 m for elliptical, linear, and rectangular trajectories, respectively. In comparison, a representative CSI-based method attains median errors of 0.574 m, 0.599 m, and 0.514 m, corresponding to an average accuracy gap of 0.26 m.

We propose an extended universal JSCC (euJSCC) framework that achieves SNR- and modulation-adaptive transmission within a single model. euJSCC employs a hypernetwork-based normalization layer for fine-grained feature vector normalization and a dynamic codebook generation (DCG) network that refines modulation-specific base codebooks according to block-wise SNR. To handle block fading channels, which consist of multiple coherence blocks, an inner-outer encoder-decoder architecture is adopted, where the outer encoder and decoder capture long-term channel statistics, and the inner encoder and decoder refine feature vectors to align with block-wise codebooks.

This curvature breaks the Fourier/Vandermonde structure behind classical subspace methods, and it is especially limiting with hybrid front-ends that provide only a small number of pilot measurements. Consequently, practical systems need continuous angle resolution and joint angle-range inference where many near-field approaches still rely on costly 2D gridding. We show that convexity can meet curvature via a lifted, gridless superresolution framework for near-field measurements. The key is a Bessel-Vandermonde factorization of the Fresnel-phase manifold that exposes a hidden Vandermonde structure in angle while isolating the range dependence into a compact coefficient map. Building on this, we introduce a lifting that maps each range bin and continuous angle to a structured rank-one atom, converting the nonlinear near-field model into a linear inverse problem over a row-sparse matrix. Recovery is posed as atomic-norm minimization and an explicit dual characterization via bounded trigonometric polynomials yields certificate-based localization that super-resolves off-grid angles and identifies active range bins. Simulations with strongly undersampled hybrid observations validate reliable joint angle-range recovery for next-generation wireless and ISAC systems."}

Acoustic cues, by contrast, naturally encode rich interaction dynamics during contact, yet remain underexploited in current multimodal fusion literature. Most multimodal fusion approaches implicitly assume homogeneous roles across modalities, and thus design flat and symmetric fusion structures. However, this assumption is ill-suited for acoustic signals, which are inherently sparse and contact-driven. To achieve precise robotic manipulation through acoustic-informed perception, we propose a hierarchical representation fusion framework that progressively integrates audio, vision, and proprioception. Our approach first conditions visual and proprioceptive representations on acoustic cues, and then explicitly models higher-order cross-modal interactions to capture complementary dependencies among modalities. The fused representation is leveraged by a diffusion-based policy to directly generate continuous robot actions from multimodal observations. The combination of end-to-end learning and hierarchical fusion structure enables the policy to exploit task-relevant acoustic information while mitigating interference from less informative modalities. The proposed method has been evaluated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, including liquid pouring and cabinet opening. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks, particularly in scenarios where acoustic cues provide task-relevant information not readily available from visual observations alone. Furthermore, a mutual information analysis is conducted to interpret the effect of audio cues in robotic manipulation via multimodal fusion."}

To address these challenges, we propose SPLIT, a sparse incremental learning framework for control-oriented vehicle dynamics modeling. SPLIT integrates three key innovations: (i) Model Decomposition. We decompose the vehicle model into invariant elements calibrated by experiments, and variant elements compensated by the residual model to reduce feature dimensionality. (ii) Local Incremental Learning. We define the valid region in the feature space and partition it into subregions, enabling efficient online learning from streaming data. (iii) GP Sparsification. We use bayesian committee machine to ensure scalable online evaluation. Integrated into model-based controllers, SPLIT is evaluated in aggressive simulations and real-vehicle experiments.

The relevance of this question spans from hybrid-MIMO analog combiners via computational meta-imagers to programmable wave-domain signal processing. Yet, no electromagnetically consistent bounds have been derived for the fidelity with which a desired operator can be realized in a real-world reconfigurable wave system. Here, we derive such bounds based on an electromagnetically consistent multiport-network model (capturing mutual coupling between tunable elements) and accounting for real-world hardware constraints (lossy, 1-bit-programmable elements). Specifically, we formulate the operator-synthesis task as a quadratically constrained fractional-quadratic problem and compute rigorous fidelity upper bounds based on semidefinite relaxation. We apply our technique to three distinct experimental setups. The first two setups are, respectively, a free-space and a rich-scattering $4\\times 4$ MIMO channel at 2.45 GHz parameterized by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) comprising 100 1-bit-programmable elements. The third setup is a $4\\times 4$ MIMO channel at 19 GHz from four feeds of a dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) to four users. We systematically study how the achievable fidelity scales with the number of tunable elements, and we probe the tightness of our bounds by trying to find optimized configurations approaching the bounds with standard discrete-optimization techniques. We observe a strong influence of the coupling strength between tunable elements on our fidelity bound. For the two RIS-based setups, our bound attests to insufficient wave-domain flexibility for the considered operator synthesis."}

Martial arts represent an extreme case of highly dynamic human motion, characterized by rapid center-of-mass shifts, complex coordination, and abrupt posture transitions. However, datasets tailored to such high-intensity scenarios remain scarce. To address this gap, we construct KungFuAthlete, a high-dynamic martial arts motion dataset derived from professional athletes' daily training videos. The dataset includes ground and jump subsets covering representative complex motion patterns. The jump subset exhibits substantially higher joint, linear, and angular velocities compared to commonly used datasets such as LAFAN1, PHUMA, and AMASS, indicating significantly increased motion intensity and complexity. Importantly, even professional athletes may fail during highly dynamic movements. Similarly, humanoid robots are prone to instability and falls under external disturbances or execution errors. Most prior work assumes motion execution remains within safe states and lacks a unified strategy for modeling unsafe states and enabling reliable autonomous recovery. We propose a novel training paradigm that enables a single policy to jointly learn high-dynamic motion tracking and fall recovery, unifying agile execution and stabilization within one framework. This framework expands robotic capability from pure motion tracking to recovery-enabled execution, promoting more robust and autonomous humanoid performance in real-world high-dynamic scenarios."}

Experiments on the TacSL benchmark show that CMT with symmetry regularization achieves a 96.59% insertion success rate, surpassing naïve and gated fusion baselines and closely matching the privileged \"wrist + contact force\" configuration (96.09%).

A UAV-mounted RIS provides blockage mitigation and passive beamforming, while the base station employs zero-forcing precoding for multiuser interference suppression. Due to limited feedback from UEHRs, their channel state information (CSI) is imperfect, leading to a worst-case secrecy energy efficiency (WCSEE) maximization problem. We jointly optimize the UAV horizontal position, RIS phase shifts, and transmit power allocation under both perfect and imperfect CSI, considering discrete RIS phases, UAV mobility, and energy-harvesting constraints. The resulting problem is highly nonconvex due to coupled channel geometry, robustness requirements, and discrete variables. To address this challenge, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning framework that learns WCSEE-maximizing policies through interaction with the wireless environment. As a structured benchmark, a successive convex approximation (SCA) approach is developed for the perfect CSI case with continuous RIS phases. Simulation results show that the proposed SAC method achieves up to 28% and 16% secrecy energy efficiency gains over SCA and deep deterministic policy gradient baselines, respectively, while demonstrating superior robustness to CSI uncertainty and stable performance across varying transmit power levels and RIS sizes."}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cost-effective PLS design for IRS-assisted mMIMO systems by employing one-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The focus is on jointly optimizing one-bit quantized precoding at the transmitter and constant-modulus phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate. This leads to a highly non-convex fractional secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem. To efficiently solve this problem, two algorithms are proposed: (1) the WMMSE-PDD algorithm, which reformulates the SRM problem into a sequence of non-fractional programs with auxiliary variables using the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) method and solves them via the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) approach, achieving superior secrecy performance; and (2) the exact penalty product Riemannian gradient descent (EPPRGD) algorithm, which transforms the SRM problem into an unconstrained optimization over a product Riemannian manifold, eliminating auxiliary variables and enabling faster convergence with a slight trade-off in secrecy performance. Both algorithms provide analytical solutions at each iteration and are proven to converge to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points.

We address this by formulating active GDM as a next-best-trajectory informative path planning (IPP) problem and propose XIT (Exploration-Exploitation Informed Trees), a sampling-based planner that balances exploration and exploitation by generating concurrent trajectories toward exploration-rich goals while collecting informative gas measurements en route. XIT draws batches of samples from an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) information field derived from the current gas posterior and expands trees using a cost that trades off travel effort against gas concentration and uncertainty.

The problem of identifying impact-robust postures is posed as a min-max optimization of the aforementioned metric. To overcome the real-time intractability of the problem, we reformulate it as a gradient-based motion task that iteratively guides the robot towards configurations that minimize the proposed metric. This task is embedded within a task-space inverse dynamics (TSID) whole-body controller, enabling seamless integration with other control objectives. The method is applied to a kinematically redundant aerial manipulator performing repeated point contact tasks. We test our method inside a realistic physics simulator and compare it with the nominal TSID. Our method leads to a reduction (up to 51% w.r.t. standard TSID) of post-impact spikes in the robot's configuration and successfully avoids actuator saturation. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of kinematic redundancy for impact robustness using additional numerical simulations on a quadruped and a humanoid robot, resulting in up to 45% reduction of post-impact spikes in the robot's state w.r.t. nominal TSID."}

This may be interpreted as finding an autoregressive representative for sets of second-order stationary Gaussian processes. While Wasserstein, or optimal transport, barycenters have been successfully used earlier in problems of spectral estimation and clustering, the resulting barycenters are non-parametric and the complexity of representing and storing them depends on, e.g., the choice of discretization grid. In contrast, the herein proposed method yields compact, low-dimensional, and interpretable spectral centroids that can be used in downstream tasks. Computing the all-pole centroids corresponds to solving a non-convex optimization problem in the model parameters, and we present a gradient descent scheme for addressing this. Although convergence to a globally optimal point cannot be guaranteed, the sub-optimality of the obtained centroids can be quantified. The proposed method is illustrated on a problem of phoneme classification."}

To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments.

This paper presents a hybrid framework that blends ontology-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) to produce semantically grounded and natural robot explanations. Ontologies ensure logical consistency and domain grounding, while LLMs provide fluent, context-aware and adaptive language generation. The proposed method grounds data from human-robot experiences, enabling robots to reason about whether events are typical or atypical based on their properties. We integrate a state-of-the-art algorithm for retrieving and constructing static contrastive ontology-based narratives with an LLM agent that uses them to produce concise, clear, interactive explanations. The approach is validated through a laboratory study replicating an industrial collaborative task. Empirical results show significant improvements in the clarity and brevity of ontology-based narratives while preserving their semantic accuracy. Initial evaluations further demonstrate the system's ability to adapt explanations to user feedback. Overall, this work highlights the potential of ontology-LLM integration to advance explainable agency, and promote more transparent human-robot collaboration."}

Modern generalist robot policies, such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, often lack the high-fidelity physical grounding required for contact-rich tool manipulation. Conversely, existing contact-aware policies that leverage tactile or haptic sensing are typically instance-specific and fail to generalize across diverse tool geometries. Bridging this gap requires learning unified contact representations from diverse data, yet a fundamental barrier remains: diverse real-world tactile data are prohibitive at scale, while direct zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to the complex dynamics of nonlinear deformation of soft sensors.\n  To address this, we propose Semantic-Contact Fields (SCFields), a unified 3D representation fusing visual semantics with dense contact estimates. We enable this via a two-stage Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline: first, we pre-train on a large simulation data set to learn general contact physics; second, we fine-tune on a small set of real data, pseudo-labeled via geometric heuristics and force optimization, to align sensor characteristics. This allows physical generalization to unseen tools. We leverage SCFields as the dense observation input for a diffusion policy to enable robust execution of contact-rich tool manipulation tasks. Experiments on scraping, crayon drawing, and peeling demonstrate robust category-level generalization, significantly outperforming vision-only and raw-tactile baselines."}

However, radio-frequency (RF) signals, which underpin wireless systems, are still not natively supported by these models. Existing LLM-based approaches for telecom focus mainly on text and structured data, while conventional RF deep-learning models are built separately for specific signal-processing tasks, highlighting a clear gap between RF perception and high-level reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce RF-GPT, a radio-frequency language model (RFLM) that utilizes the visual encoders of multimodal LLMs to process and understand RF spectrograms. In this framework, complex in-phase/quadrature (IQ) waveforms are mapped to time-frequency spectrograms and then passed to pretrained visual encoders. The resulting representations are injected as RF tokens into a decoder-only LLM, which generates RF-grounded answers, explanations, and structured outputs. To train RF-GPT, we perform supervised instruction fine-tuning of a pretrained multimodal LLM using a fully synthetic RF corpus. Standards-compliant waveform generators produce wideband scenes for six wireless technologies, from which we derive time-frequency spectrograms, exact configuration metadata, and dense captions. A text-only LLM then converts these captions into RF-grounded instruction-answer pairs, yielding roughly 12,000 RF scenes and 0.625 million instruction examples without any manual labeling. Across benchmarks for wideband modulation classification, overlap analysis, wireless-technology recognition, WLAN user counting, and 5G NR information extraction, RF-GPT achieves strong multi-task performance, whereas general-purpose VLMs with no RF grounding largely fail."}

Empirical results show push-placement reduces the manipulator travel cost by up to 11.12% versus a baseline MCTS planner and 8.56% versus dynamic stacking.

Enabling real-time localization in large-scale multi-static deployments with thousands of devices require highly efficient algorithms for estimating key parameters such as range and angle of arrival (AoA), and for fusing these parameters into location estimates. We propose two low-complexity algorithms, Joint Range-Angle Clustering (JRAC) and Stage-wise Range-Angle Estimation (SRAE). Both deliver range and angle estimation accuracy comparable to FFT- and subspace-based baselines while significantly reducing the computation. We then introduce two real-time localization algorithms that fuse the estimated ranges and AoAs: a maximum-likelihood (ML) method solved via gradient search and an iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) method. Both achieve localization accuracy comparable to ML-based brute force search albeit with far lower complexity. Experiments on a real-world large-scale multi-static testbed with 4 illuminators, 1 multi-antenna receiver, and 100 tags show that JRAC and SRAE reduce runtime by up to 40X and IRLS achieves up to 500X reduction over ML-based brute force search without degrading localization accuracy. The proposed methods achieve 3 m median localization error across all 100 tags in a sub-6GHz band with 40 MHz bandwidth.

In this work, we focus on UAV state estimation anomalies and provide a large-scale real-world UAV dataset to facilitate research aimed at improving the development of anomaly detection. Unlike existing datasets that primarily rely on injected faults into simulated data, this dataset comprises 1396 real flight logs totaling over 52 hours of flight time, collected across diverse indoor and outdoor environments using a collection of PX4-based UAVs equipped with a variety of sensor configurations. The dataset comprises both normal and anomalous flights without synthetic manipulation, making it uniquely suitable for realistic anomaly detection tasks. A structured classification is proposed that categorizes UAV state estimation anomalies into four classes: mechanical and electrical, external position, global position, and altitude anomalies. These classifications reflect collective, contextual, and outlier anomalies observed in multivariate sensor data streams, including IMU, GPS, barometer, magnetometer, distance sensors, visual odometry, and optical flow, that can be found in the PX4 logging mechanism.

Dimension reduction is a fundamental technique for reducing unnecessary model parameters, mitigating overfitting, and accelerating training and inference. A standard approach is principal component analysis (PCA), but PCA relies on matrix multiplications; on resource-constrained systems, the multiplication count itself can become a bottleneck. Element selection eliminates this cost because the reduction consists only of selecting elements, and thus the key challenge is to determine which elements should be retained. We evaluate a candidate subset through the minimum mean-squared error of linear regression that predicts a target vector from the selected elements, where the target may be, for example, a one-hot label vector in classification. When an explicit target is unavailable, the input itself can be used as the target, yielding a reconstruction-based criterion. The resulting optimization is combinatorial, and exhaustive search is impractical. To address this, we derive an efficient formula for the objective change caused by swapping a selected and an unselected element, using the matrix inversion lemma, and we perform a swap-based local search that repeatedly applies objective-decreasing swaps until no further improvement is possible.

Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points).

This paper introduces optimized certainty equivalent RCPS (OCE-RCPS), a novel framework that provides high-probability guarantees on general optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) risk measures, including conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and entropic risk. OCE-RCPS leverages upper confidence bounds to identify prediction set parameters that satisfy user-specified risk tolerance levels with provable reliability. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that OCE-RCPS satisfies the desired probabilistic constraint for loss functions such as miscoverage and false negative rate.

In this work, we propose RoboAug, a novel generative data augmentation framework that significantly minimizes the reliance on large-scale pretraining and the perfect visual recognition assumption by requiring only the bounding box annotation of a single image during training. Leveraging this minimal information, RoboAug employs pre-trained generative models for precise semantic data augmentation and integrates a plug-and-play region-contrastive loss to help models focus on task-relevant regions, thereby improving generalization and boosting task success rates. We conduct extensive real-world experiments on three robots, namely UR-5e, AgileX, and Tien Kung 2.0, spanning over 35k rollouts. Empirical results demonstrate that RoboAug significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation baselines.

However, these energy-intensive operations often rapidly deplete limited device batteries, reducing their operational lifetime and degrading the learning performance. To address this limitation, we apply energy harvesting technique to DFL systems, allowing edge devices to extract ambient energy and operate sustainably. We first derive the convergence bound for wireless DFL with energy harvesting, showing that the convergence is influenced by partial device participation and transmission packet drops, both of which further depend on the available energy supply. To accelerate convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP). Traditional MDP algorithms (e.g., value or policy iteration) require a centralized coordinator with access to all device states and exhibit exponential complexity in the number of devices, making them impractical for large-scale decentralized networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a fully decentralized policy iteration algorithm that leverages only local state information from two-hop neighboring devices, thereby substantially reducing both communication overhead and computational complexity. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed decentralized algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}

Furthermore, calibrated torque sensors are lacking in most commercial dexterous hands, adding to the difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-layer framework for multi-finger coordination, enabling high-precision manipulation of force-sensitive objects through joint control without tactile feedback. This approach solves coordinated contact force planning by incorporating graph rigidity and force closure constraints. By employing a force-to-position mapping, the planned force trajectory is converted to a joint trajectory.

While existing methods often rely on costly real-world data or utilize blind compliance through fixed controllers, we propose a framework that leverages expert-designed controller logic for transfer. Inspired by the success of privileged supervision in kinematic tasks, we employ a human-designed finite state machine based position/force controller in simulation to provide privileged guidance. The resulting policy is trained to predict the end-effector pose, contact state, and crucially the desired contact force direction. Unlike force magnitudes, which are highly sensitive to simulation inaccuracies, force directions encode high-level task geometry and remain robust across the sim-to-real gap. At deployment, these predictions configure a force-aware admittance controller. By combining the policy's directional intent with a constant, low-cost manually tuned force magnitude, the system generates adaptive, task-aligned compliance. This tuning is lightweight, typically requiring only a single scalar per contact state. We provide theoretical analysis for stability and robustness to disturbances. Experiments on four real-world tasks, i.e., microwave opening, peg-in-hole, whiteboard wiping, and door opening, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines in both success rate and robustness.

However, the number of Gaussian primitives often grows substantially during training as finer scene details are reconstructed, leading to increased memory and storage costs. Recent coarse-to-fine strategies regulate Gaussian growth by modulating the frequency content of the ground-truth images. In particular, AutoOpti3DGS employs the learnable Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enable data-adaptive frequency modulation. Nevertheless, its modulation depth is limited by the 1-level DWT, and jointly optimizing wavelet regularization with 3D reconstruction introduces gradient competition that promotes excessive Gaussian densification. In this paper, we propose a multi-level DWT-based frequency modulation framework for 3DGS. By recursively decomposing the low-frequency subband, we construct a deeper curriculum that provides progressively coarser supervision during early training, consistently reducing Gaussian counts. Furthermore, we show that the modulation can be performed using only a single scaling parameter, rather than learning the full 2-tap high-pass filter. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method further reduces Gaussian counts while maintaining competitive rendering quality."}

A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF), a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point features reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP), an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation tasks, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation.

We show that the limited torque of the motors and the nonlinear aerodynamic map from rotor speed to thrust naturally give rise to the novel concept of promptness-a metric akin to dynamic aerodynamic manipulability. By treating energy consumption as a competing objective and introducing a geometric fiber-bundle formulation, we turn redundancy resolution into a principled multi-objective program on affine fibers. The use of the diffeomorphic transformation linearizing the signed-quadratic propulsion model allows us to lay the foundations for a rigorous study of the interplay between these costs. Through an illustrative case study on 4-DoF allocation on the hexarotor, we reveal that this interplay is fiber-dependent and physically shaped by hardware inequalities. For unidirectional thrusters, the feasible fibers are compact, yielding interior allocations and a short Pareto arc, while torque demands break symmetry and separate the optima. Conversely, with reversible propellers, the null space enables antagonistic rotor co-contraction that drives promptness to hardware limits, making optimal endurance and agility fundamentally incompatible in those regimes. Ultimately, rather than relying on heuristic tuning or black box algorithms to empirically improve task execution, this framework provides a foundational understanding of why and how to achieve agility through geometry-aware control allocation, offering possible guidance for vehicle design, certification metrics, and threat-aware flight operation."}

It can benefit online decentralised decision-making and group resilience, particularly when prior knowledge is inaccurate or incomplete. These requirements can be accounted for in the offline mission planning stages to incentivise cooperative behaviours and improve mission efficiency during the NART deployment. This paper proposes a novel path planning tool for a Sparse, Aware, and Cooperative Networked Aerial Robot Team (SpArC-NART) in exploration missions. It simultaneously considers different levels of prior information regarding the environment, limited agent energy, sensing, and communication, as well as distinct NART constitutions. The communication model takes into account the limitations of user-defined radio technology and physical phenomena. The proposed tool aims to maximise the mission goals (e.g., finding one or multiple targets, covering the full area of the environment, etc.), while cooperating with other agents to reduce agent reporting times, increase their global situational awareness (e.g., their knowledge of the environment), and facilitate mission replanning, if required.

While learning-based visuomotor policies offer a promising alternative to open-loop control, their deployment on industrial platforms is challenged by a large observation-execution gap caused by sensing, inference, and control latency. This gap is significantly greater than on low-latency research robots due to high-level interfaces and slower closed-loop dynamics, making execution timing a critical system-level issue. This paper presents a latency-aware framework for deploying and evaluating visuomotor policies on industrial robotic arms under realistic timing constraints. The framework integrates calibrated multimodal sensing, temporally consistent synchronization, a unified communication pipeline, and a teleoperation interface for demonstration collection. Within this framework, we introduce a latency-aware execution strategy that schedules finite-horizon, policy-predicted action sequences based on temporal feasibility, enabling asynchronous inference and execution without modifying policy architectures or training. We evaluate the framework on a contact-rich industrial assembly task while systematically varying inference latency. Using identical policies and sensing pipelines, we compare latency-aware execution with blocking and naive asynchronous baselines. Results show that latency-aware execution maintains smooth motion, compliant contact behavior, and consistent task progression across a wide range of latencies while reducing idle time and avoiding instability observed in baseline methods. These findings highlight the importance of explicitly handling latency for reliable closed-loop deployment of visuomotor policies on industrial robots."}

By using consensus based parameter updates, and a local Hessian based descent direction at the individual nodes with gradient tracking, we first explicitly characterize a global linear convergence rate for Network-GIANT, which can be computed as the spectral radius of a $3 \\times 3$ matrix dependent on the Lipschitz continuity ($L$) and strong convexity ($μ$) parameters of the objective functions, and the spectral norm ($σ$) of the underlying undirected graph represented by a doubly stochastic consensus matrix. We provide an explicit bound on the step size parameter $η$, below which this spectral radius is guaranteed to be less than $1$. Furthermore, we derive a mixed linear-quadratic inequality based upper bound for the optimality gap norm, which allows us to conclude that, under small step size values, asymptotically, as the algorithm approaches the global optimum, it achieves a locally linear convergence rate of $1-η(1 -\\fracγμ)$ for Network-GIANT, provided the Hessian approximation error $γ$ (between the harmonic mean of the local Hessians and the global hessian (the arithmetic mean of the local Hessians) is smaller than $μ$. This asymptotically linear convergence rate of $\\approx 1-η$ explains the faster convergence rate of Network-GIANT for the first time. Numerical experiments are carried out with a reduced CovType dataset for binary logistic regression over a variety of graphs to illustrate the above theoretical results."}

The proposed algorithm combines the computational efficiency of indirect methods with the robustness of direct image-based techniques to enhance solution integrity. The pipeline starts by processing ground images (e.g., acquired by a taxiing aircraft) and relates them via a feature-based structure-from-motion (SfM) solution. A ground plane mosaic is then constructed via homography transforms and matched to satellite imagery using a sum of squares differences (SSD) of intensities. Experimental results reveal that drift within the SfM solution, similar to that observed in dead-reckoning systems, challenges the expected accuracy benefits of map-matching with a wide-baseline ground-plane mosaic. However, the proposed algorithm demonstrates key integrity features, such as the ability to identify registration anomalies and ambiguous matches. These characteristics of the pipeline can mitigate outlier behaviors and contribute toward a robust, certifiable solution for autonomous surface movement of aircraft."}

This study introduces CLAW (Compliant Leaf-spring Anisotropic soft Wrist), a novel soft wrist mechanism that addresses these limitations through a simple yet effective design using two orthogonal leaf springs and rotary joints with a locking mechanism. CLAW provides large 6-degree-of-freedom deformation (40mm lateral, 20mm vertical), anisotropic stiffness that is tunable across three distinct modes, while maintaining lightweight construction (330g) at low cost ($550). Experimental evaluations using imitation learning demonstrate that CLAW achieves 76% success rate in benchmark peg-insertion tasks, outperforming both the Fin Ray gripper (43%) and rigid gripper alternatives (36%). CLAW successfully handles diverse contact-rich scenarios, including precision assembly with tight tolerances and delicate object manipulation, demonstrating its potential to enable robust robot learning in contact-rich domains.

Common approaches rely on prediction-based planning or risk-aware control, but these are typically treated in isolation, limiting their ability to capture the coupled nature of action and inference in interactive settings. This gap becomes especially critical in uncertain scenarios, where simply reacting to predictions can lead to unsafe maneuvers or overly conservative behavior. Our central insight is that safe interaction requires not only estimating human behavior but also shaping it when ambiguity poses risks. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical belief model that structures human behavior across coarse discrete intents and fine motion modes, updated via Bayesian inference for interpretable multi-resolution reasoning. On top of this, we develop an active probing strategy that identifies when multimodal ambiguity in human predictions may compromise safety and plans disambiguating actions that both reveal intent and gently steer human decisions toward safer outcomes. Finally, a runtime risk-evaluation layer based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ensures that all probing actions remain within human risk tolerance during influence. Our simulations in lane-merging and unsignaled intersection scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves higher success rates and shorter completion times compared to existing methods. These results highlight the benefit of coupling belief inference, probing, and risk monitoring, yielding a principled and interpretable framework for planning under uncertainty."}

However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility."}

In this work, we propose \\emph{Semantic Anchored Functional Maps} (SemFM), a framework for transferring affordances across objects from a single visual demonstration. Starting from a coarse mesh reconstructed from an image, our method identifies semantically corresponding functional regions between objects, selects mutually exclusive semantic anchors, and propagates these constraints over the surface using a functional map to obtain a dense, semantically consistent correspondence. This enables demonstrated interaction regions to be transferred across geometrically diverse objects in a lightweight and interpretable manner.

While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations.

To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30."}

For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations."}

In this paper, we propose MAILS, a novel map-free LiDAR relocalization framework for UAVs. A Locality-Preserving Sliding Window Attention module is first introduced to extract locally discriminative geometric features from sparse point clouds. To handle substantial yaw rotations and altitude variations encountered during UAV flight, we then design a coordinate-independent feature initialization module and a locally invariant positional encoding mechanism, which together significantly enhance the robustness of feature extraction. Furthermore, existing LiDAR-based relocalization datasets fail to capture real-world UAV flight characteristics, such as irregular trajectories and varying altitudes. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale LiDAR localization dataset for UAVs, which comprises four scenes and various flight trajectories, designed to evaluate UAV relocalization performance under realistic conditions.

However, most existing mmWave sensing solutions are designed for snapshot-based parameter estimation and rely on hardware-intensive architectures, making scalable and persistent world modeling difficult to achieve. This article rethinks mmWave sensing from a system-level perspective and introduces a generative-space framework, in which sensing is realized through controlled traversal of a low-dimensional excitation space spanning frequency, waveform, and physical embodiment. This perspective decouples spatial observability from rigid antenna arrays and transmit-time multiplexing, enabling flexible and scalable sensing-by-design radios. To illustrate the practicality of this framework, we present a representative realization called Multi-RF Chain Frequency-as-Aperture Clip-on Aperture Fabric (MRC-FaA-CAF), where multiple FMCW sources coordinate frequency-selective modules distributed along guided-wave backbones. This architecture enables interference-free excitation, preserves beat-frequency separability, and maintains low calibration overhead. Case studies show that generative-space-driven sensing can achieve update rates comparable to phased arrays while avoiding dense RF replication and the latency penalties of TDM-MIMO systems. Overall, this work positions generative-space-driven sensing as a practical architectural foundation for mmWave systems that move beyond snapshot sensing toward persistent EM world modeling."}

Within this formulation, we propose Gaussian sequences with multi-scale dynamics, a novel representation for dynamic 3D Gaussians derived through compositions of multi-level motion. This layered structure substantially alleviates ambiguity of reconstruction and promotes physically plausible dynamics.

However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks."}

In this paper, we show how a recently proposed gray-box system identification tool enables the estimation of a soft robot's current pose while at the same time learning a bending stiffness model. For estimation and learning, we rely solely on a nominal constant-curvature robot model and measurements of the robot's base reactions (e.g., base forces). The estimation scheme -- relying on a marginalized particle filter -- allows us to conveniently interface nominal constant-curvature equations with a Gaussian Process (GP) bending stiffness model to be learned. This, in contrast to estimation via a random walk over stiffness values, enables prediction of bending stiffness and improves overall model quality. We demonstrate, using real-world soft-robot data, that the method learns a bending stiffness model online while accurately estimating the robot's pose. Notably, reduced multi-step forward-prediction errors indicate that the learned bending-stiffness GP improves overall model quality."}

Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time."}
