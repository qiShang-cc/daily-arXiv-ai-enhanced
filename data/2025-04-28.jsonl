To improve the ranging performance while\nmaximizing the resource utilization efficiency, future 6G ISAC networks have to\nreuse data payload signals for both communication and sensing, whose inherent\nrandomness may deteriorate the ranging performance. To address this issue, this\npaper investigates the power allocation (PA) design for an OFDM-based ISAC\nsystem under random signaling, aiming to reduce the ranging sidelobe level of\nboth periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF) of the\nISAC signal.

We then rigorously prove that the uniform PA scheme\nachieves the global minimum of the EISL for both P-ACF and A-ACF. As a step\nfurther, we show that this scheme also minimizes the P-ACF sidelobe level at\nevery lag. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the P-ACF case with\nfrequency-domain zero-padding, which is a typical approach to improve the\nranging resolution.
