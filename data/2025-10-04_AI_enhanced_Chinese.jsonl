However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems\noften fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency,\nand energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering\nultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we\npresent JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware\naccelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse,\nhigh-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural\nnetwork architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the\ntraditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving\ncomputational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our\nproposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+\ndataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To\nfurther enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of\nactivation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization.\nThrough software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at\n400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames\nPer Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\\mu$J/frame.

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics", "summary": "State estimation techniques for continuum robots (CRs) typically involve\nusing computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations,\nor are limited to quasi-static methods. These limitations can be sensitive to\nunmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph\noptimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state\nestimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on\ncontinuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process\n(GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show\nadaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout.

Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)\noffer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult\nto steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining\nobjectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing\nthis, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes\ninternet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of\ndirectly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a\nvisual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware\nnavigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these\nvisual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows\nnatural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors.

In extensive real-world\nevaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on\nobject reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving\nsuccess rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen\nscenarios.

To closely match the\nstatistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise\nvia the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC\nmodem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches\nbased on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the\nlength of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate\ncyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss\nfunction to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training\ndataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various\napplications.

Ultrasound and\nelectromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and\nposition. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool\ncollides with the tumor boundary.

The existing approaches, such as traditional\nsampling-based methods, struggle with resolution control and scalability, while\nimitation learning-based methods require a large amount of demonstration data.\nActive Neural Time Fields (ANTFields) have recently emerged as a promising\nsolution by using local observations to learn cost-to-go functions without\nrelying on demonstrations. Despite their potential, these methods are hampered\nby challenges such as spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting, which diminish\ntheir effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these issues, our approach\ndecomposes the planning problem into a hierarchical structure.

Sensing parameters are embedded within the\ntarget-reflected signal leaked to unauthorized passive radar sensing\neavesdroppers (Eve), implying that they can silently extract sensory\ninformation without prior knowledge of the information data. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a sensing-secure ISAC framework that ensures secure\ntarget detection and estimation for the legitimate system, while obfuscating\nunauthorized sensing without requiring any prior knowledge of Eve. By\nintroducing artificial imperfections into the ambiguity function (AF) of ISAC\nsignals, we introduce artificial targets into Eve's range profile which\nincrease its range estimation ambiguity. In contrast, the legitimate sensing\nreceiver (Alice) can suppress these AF artifacts using mismatched filtering,\nalbeit at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. Employing an OFDM\nsignal, a structured subcarrier power allocation scheme is designed to shape\nthe secure autocorrelation function (ACF), inserting periodic peaks to mislead\nEve's range estimation and degrade target detection performance. To quantify\nthe sensing security, we introduce peak sidelobe level (PSL) and integrated\nsidelobe level (ISL) as key performance metrics. Then, we analyze the three-way\ntrade-offs between communication, legitimate sensing, and sensing security,\nhighlighting the impact of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling on system\nperformance.

In this environment,\nwe address the fundamental challenge of balancing exploration -- gathering\ninformation about the environment -- and exploitation -- selecting to the\naction with the highest predicted reward. We propose two algorithms, Kalman\nfilter Upper Confidence Bound (Kalman-UCB) and Information filter Directed\nExploration Action-selection (IDEA). Kalman-UCB uses the principle of optimism\nin the face of uncertainty. IDEA selects actions that maximize the combination\nof the predicted reward and a term that quantifies how much an action minimizes\nthe error of the Kalman filter state prediction, which depends on the LGDS\nproperty called observability. IDEA is motivated by applications such as\nhyperparameter optimization in machine learning.

In RoboCasa simulation,\nSymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate.

To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive\nbias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,\nencouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond\nany single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training\nplatform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch\nparallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single\ntraining run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization.\nTheoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator\ninductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim\nsubstantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for\nexample, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim\nbaseline.

We\npropose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the\nvariational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice\nand Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their\nobservations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high\nagreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is\nrealized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial\ntraining. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction\nreconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is\nguaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study\nphysical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely\non the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus\nsuffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility\nscenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated\nsensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps\nmeasured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified\nthrough both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR)\nmeasurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's\nposition.

For the SCER adversary, I\npredict the adversary's needed receiving radio equipment to break\nauthentication security.

Current approaches\naddress this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and\nthen training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference\ntrajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot\nsliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in\nthe reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has\ndemonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward\nengineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when\nexcessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with\nexisting retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General\nMotion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source\nretargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source\ndataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate\nretargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset\nof the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts\nin retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for\ndynamic or long sequences.

When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans\nseek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future\ndecision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents\nhave addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies\nbetween their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce\nInformation Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making\nframework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to\nalign internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both\nagent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to\nactively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,\ndetect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising\ntask-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark\nsuite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations\nand uncertain dynamics.

Although most interactive imitation\nlearning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,\nthey do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more\nhazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from\nHuman Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals\ncontained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The\nkey idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time\nsteps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent\nfollows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the\npreference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,\nexpert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the\nagent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and\nreducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments\non both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate\nits efficiency and generality.

However, current\nVLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final\nactions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.\nTheir post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying\nprimarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these\nchallenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates\nReinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and\nexecution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with\nverifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output\nformatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.\nMoreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides\nchain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory\nannotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,\nsimulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior\ngeneralization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods.

We introduce a novel\nmethod, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing\nisometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise\nreconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based\nframework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as\nlocally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the\nconformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately\ncomputes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples\nconstraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other\napproaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity\nof the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative\noptimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,\nutilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D\npoint clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both\nsynthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing\napproaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness.

We present a cooperative guidance framework for the evader-defender\nteam that guarantees interception of the pursuer before it can capture the\nevader, even under highly dynamic and uncertain engagement conditions. Unlike\ntraditional heuristic, optimal control, or differential game-based methods, we\napproach the problem within a time-constrained guidance framework, leveraging\ntrue proportional navigation based approach that ensures robust and guaranteed\nsolutions to the aerial defense problem. The proposed strategy is\ncomputationally lightweight, scalable to a large number of agent\nconfigurations, and does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy or\ncontrol laws. From arbitrary initial geometries, our method guarantees that key\nengagement errors are driven to zero within a fixed time, leading to a\nsuccessful mission.
