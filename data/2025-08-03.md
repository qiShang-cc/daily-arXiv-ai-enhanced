Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段感知框架，用于异构混合模数H2AD MIMO结构中智能感知多发射源的数量和方向，并设计了三种目标数量感知方法和一种高效的DOA估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构混合模数H2AD MIMO结构中多发射源数量和方向感知的难题，替代大规模全数字MIMO的高能耗、高成本和高复杂度问题。

Method: 提出两阶段感知框架，包括三种目标数量感知方法（改进的EDC、增强DNN和1D-CNN）和一种高效DOA估计方法（OMC-DOA）。

Result: 仿真显示，三种方法在中高信噪比下能100%感知目标数量，1D-CNN在极低信噪比下表现最佳；OMC-DOA在多源环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了H2AD MIMO结构中的多源感知问题，为未来无线网络提供了高效、低复杂度的解决方案。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

### [3] [Neural Energy Landscapes Predict Working Memory Decline After Brain Tumor Resection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23057)
*Triet M. Tran,Sina Khanmohammadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究通过分析脑肿瘤患者术前fMRI数据，发现高阶脑能量特征与术后工作记忆下降相关，预测准确率达90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨脑肿瘤手术认知功能障碍风险，为个性化手术规划和干预提供依据。

Result: 术前能量特征可预测术后记忆下降（准确率90%），记忆较差者能量转换更极端。

Conclusion: 术前神经动态变化可预测认知风险，支持个性化手术方案以减少术后认知损伤。

Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成扩散模型的环境感知跨基站CKM推理方法BS-1-to-N，通过BSLE和注意力机制实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在分布式节点架构中CKM构建成本高，需高效解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过挖掘无线环境中的隐含相关性，实现了高效的跨基站CKM推理，具有实际部署优化价值。

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) inference across base stations (BSs) is the key
to achieving efficient environmentaware communications. This paper proposes an
environmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the
generative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location
embedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS
location information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the
cross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to
respectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as
that among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target
BSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM
inference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.
Specifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free
networks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM
construction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N
model is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any
potential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by
exploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same
wireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to
multi-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same
wireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit
correlation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the
proposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs. We
provide extensive comparisons of CKM inference between the proposed BS-1-to-N
generative model versus benchmarking schemes, and provide one use case study to
demonstrate its practical application for the optimization of BS deployment.

### [6] [A Secure Full-Duplex Wireless Circulator enabled by Non-Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal RIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23381)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NR-BD-RIS在全双工无线循环器中的应用，以增强通信安全性和系统性能。

Method: 提出一种基于BCD和PDD的迭代优化算法，解决多用户总速率最大化问题。

Result: 数值评估显示NR-BD-RIS在支持多方向波束时优于R-BD-RIS和传统D-RIS。

Conclusion: NR-BD-RIS在安全传输和多方向支持方面表现优异，验证了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a
promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling
flexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the
interconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave
reconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at
one port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local
control of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further
enhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,
channel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among
non-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of
NR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices
communicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure
transmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses
signal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a
physics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural
scattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,
the advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate
an all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization
algorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual
decomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS
consistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal
(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two
impinging and reflection directions need to be supported. By analyzing the
power of signals from all other users and the beampatterns, we show that secure
transmission can be achieved.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于FPGA的硬件加速EVM（EVMx），显著提升了智能合约执行速度，比CPU方案快61%至99%，区块执行速度提升6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出FPGA硬件加速的EVMx架构，利用硬件并行性和高速处理能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，常见操作码执行时间减少61%至99%，区块执行速度提高了6倍。

Conclusion: 硬件加速EVMx能显著提升智能合约执行效率，适用于EVM兼容区块链。

Abstract: Ethereum blockchain uses smart contracts (SCs) to implement decentralized
applications (dApps). SCs are executed by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)
running within an Ethereum client. Moreover, the EVM has been widely adopted by
other blockchain platforms, including Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and
more. However, the EVM performance is limited by the constraints of the
general-purpose computer it operates on. This work proposes offloading SC
execution onto a dedicated hardware-based EVM. Specifically, EVMx is an
FPGA-based SC execution engine that benefits from the inherent parallelism and
high-speed processing capabilities of a hardware architecture. Synthesis
results demonstrate a reduction in execution time of 61% to 99% for commonly
used operation codes compared to CPU-based SC execution environments. Moreover,
the execution time of Ethereum blocks on EVMx is up to 6x faster compared to
analogous works in the literature. These results highlight the potential of the
proposed architecture to accelerate SC execution and enhance the performance of
EVM-compatible blockchains.

### [8] [Channel Estimation for 6G Near-Field Wireless Communications: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23526)

Conclusion: 该综述为6G近场信道估计提供了重要的理论基础和技术参考，同时指出了未来的研究挑战和方向。

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are expected to adopt extremely
large aperture arrays (ELAAs), novel antenna architectures, and operate in
extremely high-frequency bands to meet growing data demands. ELAAs
significantly increase the number of antennas, enabling finer spatial
resolution and improved beamforming. At high frequencies, ELAAs shift
communication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where
spherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle
and distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel
estimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field
scenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel
estimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an
electromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences,
alongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream
near-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major
estimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations
(single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and
RIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among
estimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide
insights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel
estimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research
directions.

Result: 在多种图信号处理任务中表现出优异的适应性及性能。

Conclusion: MPGFRFT框架在信号压缩、去噪及图像加密等领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) applies a single global
fractional order to all graph frequencies, which restricts its adaptability to
diverse signal characteristics across the spectral domain. To address this
limitation, in this paper, we propose two types of multiple-parameter GFRFTs
(MPGFRFTs) and establish their corresponding theoretical frameworks. We design
a spectral compression strategy tailored for ultra-low compression ratios,
effectively preserving essential information even under extreme dimensionality
reduction. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a learnable order vector scheme
that enables adaptive compression and denoising, demonstrating strong
performance on both graph signals and images. We explore the application of
MPGFRFTs to image encryption and decryption. Experimental results validate the
versatility and superior performance of the proposed MPGFRFT framework across
various graph signal processing tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为无线网络优化提供了理论支持和实用工具，特别是在凸性条件和速率最大化问题的求解方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless
networks, with a focus on the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) and
achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into
interference patterns of modern network architectures, such as cell-less and
extremely large MIMO networks, and it generalizes existing characterizations of
the weak Pareto boundary. A central contribution is the derivation of
sufficient conditions that guarantee convexity of the utility regions.
Convexity is an important property because it ensures that time sharing (or
user grouping) cannot simultaneously increase the utility of all users when the
network operates on the weak Pareto boundary. These sufficient conditions also
have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate
maximization problems that are inherently convex without any variable
transformations, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably
optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide a rigorous justification
for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable
rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an
alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO
literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the
beamforming strategy.

Abstract: Real-time transmission of high-resolution video signals in an uncompressed
and unencrypted format requires an ultra-reliable and low-latency
communications (URLLC) medium with high bandwidth to maintain the quality of
experience (QoE) for users. We put forward the design and experimental
demonstration of a high-performance laser-based optical wireless communication
(OWC) system that enables high-definition (HD) video transmission with
submillisecond latencies. The serial digital interface (SDI) output of a camera
is used to transmit the live video stream over an optical wireless link by
directly modulating the SDI signal on the intensity of a 940 nm vertical cavity
surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The proposed SDI over light fidelity (LiFi)
system corroborates error-free transmission of full HD (FHD) and 4K
ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions at data rates of 2.97 Gb/s and 5.94
Gb/s, respectively, with a measured end-to-end latency of under 35 ns. Since
SDI standards support various video formats and VCSELs are high-bandwidth and
low-power devices, this presents a scalable and inexpensive solution for
wireless connectivity between professional broadcast equipment using
off-the-shelf SDI components.

Result: 实验表明，TTR-matching框架在识别可信合作者和最大化任务价值方面优于其他算法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了任务与资源匹配问题，支持价值驱动的物理计算系统实现。

Abstract: Due to the diverse physical attributes of computing resources and tasks,
developing effective mechanisms to facilitate task and resource matching in
complex connected systems for value-oriented task completion has become
increasingly challenging. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a
networked physical computing system that integrates the physical attributes of
computing resources and tasks as well as task-specific trust relationships
among devices to enable value-driven task completion. Specifically, we propose
a state-of-the-art hypergraph-aided trusted task-resource matching
(TTR-matching) framework to achieve the envisioned physical computing. First, a
task-specific trusted physical resource hypergraph is defined, which integrates
task-specific trust, the physical attributes of resources, and task types. This
enables accurate modeling of device collaboration dependencies under specific
task types. Next, a task hypergraph is generated to associate the task
initiator with the physical attributes of the corresponding tasks. Based on
these two hypergraphs, a hypergraph matching algorithm is designed to
facilitate task-specific trusted collaborator selection and accurate
task-resource matching for value-maximizing task completion. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TTR-matching framework
outperforms comparison algorithms in identifying task-specific trustworthy
collaborators and maximizing the average value of task completion.

Abstract: Having established that Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences are inherently linear
micro-frequency hopping (lmFH) symbols, this paper first presents an intuitive

using the lmFH pattern. This yields interesting results. Subsequently, an
alternative form for computing the cumulative sum of ZC sequences using the
Generalized Quadratic Gauss Sum is introduced. Furthermore, building on the
micro-frequency hopping (mFH) concept, this paper shows that the DFT of ZC
sequences can be transformed into an lmFH symbol with frequency shift and phase
offset. Therefore, the DFT of ZC sequences can be computed via cumulative
frequency points, similar to the computation of normal mFH symbols.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the stochastic security performance of a multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a
downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to
simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target's angular location, and
counteract eavesdropping threats. The attack model considers a passive
single-antenna communication eavesdropper intercepting communication data, as
well as a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target's
location. We also consider a malicious target scenario where the target plays
the role of the communication eavesdropper. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers
channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target's azimuth angle is uniformly
distributed. To evaluate the performance in this random network, we derive the
ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), for
target localization, at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves
computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. We
characterize the boundary of the CRB-secrecy rate region, and interpret the
performance tradeoffs between communication and sensing while guaranteeing a
level of security and privacy in the random ISAC networks.

sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Firstly, focusing on a single-user
scenario, we reveal the function of movable elements by performance analysis,
and then design a joint beamforming and element position optimization scheme.
Further, we extend it to a general multi-user scenario, and also propose an

Motivation: 卫星通信在未来无线网络中日益重要，但链路预算有限；语义通信虽能解决这一问题，却增加了计算资源消耗的挑战。

Abstract: As satellite communications play an increasingly important role in future
wireless networks, the issue of limited link budget in satellite systems has
attracted significant attention in current research. Although semantic
communications emerge as a promising solution to address these constraints, it
introduces the challenge of increased computational resource consumption in
wireless communications. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-layer
hybrid bit and generative semantic communication framework which can adapt to
the dynamic satellite communication networks. Furthermore, to balance the
semantic communication efficiency and performance in satellite-to-ground
transmissions, we introduce a novel semantic communication efficiency metric
(SEM) that evaluates the trade-offs among latency, computational consumption,
and semantic reconstruction quality in the proposed framework. Moreover, we
utilize a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to optimize the resource allocation in the proposed
network. Simulation results demonstrate the flexibility of our proposed
transmission framework and the effectiveness of the proposed metric SEM,
illustrate the relationships among various semantic communication metrics.

Conclusion: BDRIS架构在CFmMIMO系统中能有效提升SWIPT性能，为未来通信系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (BDRISs) into cell free massive multiple input multiple output
(CFmMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users energy
receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time
frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving
ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A
protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs
to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently,
closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average
sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive
optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power
control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term
statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then
effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems,
efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the
scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep
reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power
control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully
connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the
conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in
the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix
design is employed.

TL;DR: WiRM通过两阶段方法改进呼吸监测，第一阶段提升呼吸频率估计精度，第二阶段提高呼吸波形相关性，并在噪声环境下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有呼吸监测方法多关注呼吸频率或胸部运动波形，但缺乏高精度和鲁棒性。WiRM旨在改进这两点。

Method: WiRM采用共轭乘法进行相位净化和自适应多迹追踪（AMTC）优化呼吸频率估计，并以此为基准分解和选择呼吸波形。

Result: 呼吸频率估计RMSE降低38%，波形相关性提升178.3%，且在噪声环境下表现优越。

Conclusion: WiRM在精度和鲁棒性上显著优于现有方法，并通过仿真工具验证了其噪声适应性。

Abstract: Monitoring respiratory health with the use of channel state information (CSI)
has shown promising results. Many existing methods focus on monitoring only the
respiratory rate, while others focus on monitoring the motion of the chest as a
patient breathes, which is referred to as the respiratory waveform. This paper
presents WiRM, a two-staged approach to contactless respiration monitoring. In
the first stage, WiRM improves upon existing respiratory rate estimation
techniques by using conjugate multiplication for phase sanitisation and
adaptive multi-trace carving (AMTC) for tracing how the respiratory rate
changes over time. When compared against three state-of-the-art methods, WiRM
has achieved an average reduction of $38\%$ in respiratory rate root mean
squared error (RMSE). In the second stage, WiRM uses this improved respiratory
rate estimate to inform the decomposition and selection of the respiratory
waveform from the CSI data. Remarkably, WiRM delivers a $178.3\%$ improvement
in average absolute correlation with the ground truth respiratory waveform.
Within the literature, it is difficult to compare the robustness of existing
algorithms in noisy environments. In this paper, we develop a purpose-built
simulation toolkit to evaluate the robustness of respiration monitoring
solutions under various noise conditions, including thermal, multiplicative,
and phase noise. Our results show that WiRM demonstrates improved or comparable
resilience to these common noise sources.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索如何更好地表征语音信号的动态特性，以减少自动语音识别中的词错误率并提高性别独立性。

Method: 方法包括使用SSCF的极坐标参数表征声学转换，结合MFCC捕捉更详细的频谱信息，并用SSCF0作为伪特征描述基频信息。

Result: 结果显示，提出的参数显著降低了词错误率，并在性别独立性上优于基准MFCC。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合动态参数的SSCF和MFCC能有效提升ASR性能，特别是在越南语等语言环境中。

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed
parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender
independence than the baseline MFCCs.

TL;DR: EMORe是一种自适应重建方法，通过整合自适应双箱校正和显式离群值拒绝，提升5D心脏MRI的运动鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统5D MRI方法中的运动分箱技术存在残留运动伪影，影响临床应用。

Method: 在EM框架中交替执行E步和M步，优化数据分箱和图像估计。

Result: 在仿真和人体实验中，EMORe显著提升了图像质量并减少运动伪影。

Conclusion: EMORe增强了5D心脏MRI的临床适用性和诊断信心。

Abstract: We propose EMORe, an adaptive reconstruction method designed to enhance
motion robustness in free-running, free-breathing self-gated 5D cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Traditional self-gating-based motion binning
for 5D MRI often results in residual motion artifacts due to inaccuracies in
cardiac and respiratory signal extraction and sporadic bulk motion,
compromising clinical utility. EMORe addresses these issues by integrating
adaptive inter-bin correction and explicit outlier rejection within an
expectation-maximization (EM) framework, whereby the E-step and M-step are
executed alternately until convergence. In the E-step, probabilistic (soft) bin
assignments are refined by correcting misassignment of valid data and rejecting
motion-corrupted data to a dedicated outlier bin. In the M-step, the image
estimate is improved using the refined soft bin assignments. Validation in a
simulated 5D MRXCAT phantom demonstrated EMORe's superior performance compared
to standard compressed sensing reconstruction, showing significant improvements
in peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, edge sharpness, and
bin assignment accuracy across varying levels of simulated bulk motion. In vivo
validation in 13 volunteers further confirmed EMORe's robustness, significantly
enhancing blood-myocardium edge sharpness and reducing motion artifacts
compared to compressed sensing, particularly in scenarios with controlled
coughing-induced motion. Although EMORe incurs a modest increase in
computational complexity, its adaptability and robust handling of bulk motion
artifacts significantly enhance the clinical applicability and diagnostic
confidence of 5D cardiac MRI.

TL;DR: 研究分析了锚点位置对步态、肌肉活动和能量消耗的影响，发现后膝与前髋锚点组合效果最佳，但需个性化设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锚点位置影响外骨骼与人体相互作用，但其对外骨骼效力与效率的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 11名受试者穿戴XoSoft外骨骼，测试5种锚点配置对步态、肌肉活动及代谢的影响。

Result: 后膝与前髋锚点组合降低髋屈肌活动10.21%和代谢消耗18.45%，但效果因人而异。

Conclusion: 锚点位置显著影响外骨骼效果，需个性化设计，未来需验证个性化模型在临床中的应用。

Abstract: Anchor point placement is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of exosuit
design since it determines how forces interact with the human body. This work
analyzes the impact of different anchor point positions on gait kinematics,
muscular activation and energetic consumption. A total of six experiments were
conducted with 11 subjects wearing the XoSoft exosuit, which assists hip
flexion in five configurations. Subjects were instrumented with an IMU-based
motion tracking system, EMG sensors, and a mask to measure metabolic
consumption. The results show that positioning the knee anchor point on the
posterior side while keeping the hip anchor on the anterior part can reduce
muscle activation in the hip flexors by up to 10.21\% and metabolic expenditure
by up to 18.45\%. Even if the only assisted joint was the hip, all the
configurations introduced changes also in the knee and ankle kinematics.
Overall, no single configuration was optimal across all subjects, suggesting
that a personalized approach is necessary to transmit the assistance forces
optimally. These findings emphasize that anchor point position does indeed have
a significant impact on exoskeleton effectiveness and efficiency. However,
these optimal positions are subject-specific to the exosuit design, and there
is a strong need for future work to tailor musculoskeletal models to individual
characteristics and validate these results in clinical populations.
