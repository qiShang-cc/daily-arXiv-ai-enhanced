However, we're planning to work more on the topic", "summary": "This paper presents a proposed AI Deep Learning model that addresses common\nchallenges encountered in Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems. In this\nwork, we run a Python simulation that models a basic VLC system primarily\naffected by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). A Deep Neural Network (DNN)\nis then trained to equalize the noisy signal received and improve signal\nintegrity. The system evaluates and compares the Bit Error Rate (BER) before\nand after equalization to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.\nThis paper starts by introducing the concept of visible light communication,\nthen it dives deep into some details about the process of VLC and the\nchallenges it faces, shortly after we propose our project which helps overcome\nthese challenges. We finally conclude with a lead for future work, highlighting\nthe areas that are most suitable for future improvements."}

Under revision in an IEEE Journal", "summary": "Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising chirp-based\nwaveform with high flexibility and resilience, making it well-suited for\nnext-generation wireless networks, particularly in high-mobility scenarios. In\nthis paper, we investigate the ambiguity functions (AFs) of AFDM signals, which\nfundamentally characterize their range and velocity estimation capabilities in\nboth monostatic and bistatic settings. Specifically, we first derive the\nauto-ambiguity function (AAF) of an AFDM chirp subcarrier, revealing its\n\"spike-like\" local property and \"periodic-like\" global property along the\nrotated delay and Doppler dimensions. This structure naturally forms a\nparallelogram for each localized pulse of the AAF of the AFDM chirp subcarrier,\nenabling unambiguous target sensing. Then, we study the cross-ambiguity\nfunction (CAF) between two different AFDM chirp subcarriers, which exhibits the\nsame local and global properties as the AAF but with an additional shift along\nthe Doppler dimension. We then extend our analysis to the AF of various typical\nAFDM frames, considering both deterministic pilot and random data symbols. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that inserting guard symbols in AFDM facilitates\ninterference-free sensing. Simulation results validate our theoretical\nfindings, highlighting AFDM's strong potential for ISAC applications."}

Diagnosis of sleep apnea\nusually requires an overnight polysomnography at the sleep laboratory. In this\npaper, we used a wearable device which measures reflectance\nphotoplethysmography (PPG) at the wrist and upper arm to estimate continuous\nSpO2 levels during sleep and subsequently derive an oxygen desaturation index\n(ODI) for each patient. On a cohort of 170 patients undergoing sleep apnea\nscreening, we evaluated whether this ODI value could represent a surrogate\nmarker for the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) for the diagnosis and severity\nassessment of sleep apnea. As the ODI was simultaneously obtained at the\nfingertip, upper arm and wrist, we compared ODI diagnostic performance\ndepending on the measurement location. We then further evaluated the accuracy\nof ODI as a direct predictor for moderate and severe sleep apnea as defined by\nestablished AHI thresholds. We found that ODI values obtained at the upper arm\nwere good predictors for moderate or severe sleep apnea, with 86% accuracy, 96%\nsensitivity and 70% specificity, whereas ODI values obtained at the wrist were\nless reliable as a diagnostic tool."}

In such a context, the proposed approach\nalternates between environmental perception, recognizing possible emitters in\nits frequency range, and an action stage, synthesizing and transmitting a\ntailored radar waveform to achieve the desired imaging task while guaranteeing\nspectral coexistence with overlaid emitters. The perception is carried out by a\nspectrum sensing module providing the true relevant spectral parameters of the\nsources in the environment. The action stage employs a tailored signal design\nprocess, synthesizing a radar waveform with bespoke spectral notches, enabling\nISAR imaging over a wide spectral bandwidth without interfering with the other\nradio frequency (RF) sources. A key enabling requirement for the proposed\napplication is the capability to successfully recover possible missing data in\nthe frequency domain (induced by spectral notches) and in the slow-time\ndimension (enabling concurrent RF activities still in a cognitive fashion).\nThis process is carried out by resorting to advanced methods based on either\nthe compressed-sensing framework or a rank-minimization recovery strategy. The\ncapabilities of the proposed system are assessed exploiting a dataset of drone\nmeasurements in the frequency band between 13 GHz and 15 GHz. Results highlight\nthe effectiveness of the devised architecture to enable spectral compatibility\nwhile delivering high-quality ISAR images as well as additional RF activities."}

This paper\npresents a novel optimization theory-based safe deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) framework for ultra-reliable WNCSs, ensuring constraint satisfaction\nwhile optimizing performance, for the first time in the literature. The\napproach minimizes power consumption under key constraints, including Peak Age\nof Information (PAoI) violation probability, transmit power, and schedulability\nin the finite blocklength regime. PAoI violation probability is uniquely\nderived by combining stochastic maximum allowable transfer interval (MATI) and\nmaximum allowable packet delay (MAD) constraints in a multi-sensor network. The\nframework consists of two stages: optimization theory and safe DRL. The first\nstage derives optimality conditions to establish mathematical relationships\namong variables, simplifying and decomposing the problem. The second stage\nemploys a safe DRL model where a teacher-student framework guides the DRL agent\n(student). The control mechanism (teacher) evaluates compliance with system\nconstraints and suggests the nearest feasible action when needed. Extensive\nsimulations show that the proposed framework outperforms rule-based and other\noptimization theory based DRL benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher\nrewards, and greater stability."}

Building upon ChannelComp, a general framework for\ndesigning modulation schemes to support arbitrary function computation over a\nmultiple access channel (MAC), SeMAC maps each input value to a sequence of\nmodulated symbols using distinct constellation diagrams across multiple time\nslots. This extension generalizes ChannelComp by enabling flexible modulation\ndesign across multiple transmissions, thereby enhancing reliability against\nchannel noise. We formulate the modulation design as a non-convex optimization\nproblem, apply matrix lifting to relax it into a semidefinite programming\n(SDP), and recover a feasible modulation solution by solving a low rank\napproximation. For scenarios where the modulation formats cannot be changed, we\nfurther develop a power adaptation scheme that adjusts amplitude and phase of\nthe modulated symbols while preserving the modulation structure. Numerical\nresults show that SeMAC can achieve a reliable computation by reducing the\ncomputation error up to 18 dB compared to other existing methods, particularly\nfor the product function."}

This paper proposes a novel approach integrating both aspects\nthrough a theoretically grounded model. The RIR is decomposed into\ninterpretable parameters: white Gaussian noise filtered by a\nfrequency-dependent exponential decay (e.g. modeling wall absorption) and an\nautoregressive filter (e.g. modeling microphone response).
