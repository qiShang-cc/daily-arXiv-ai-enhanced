### [1] [Underwater Multi-Wavelength Optical Links With Blue Targets and Constraints: Opportunities and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15430)
*Alain R. Ndjiongue,Octavia A. Dobre,Hyundong Shin,Harald Haas*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 水下光无线技术相比声学技术具有优势，但光信号受吸收和散射影响。论文提出一种多波长光源设计框架，重新定义蓝色光的CSK约束区域，以优化传输距离和速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 声学信号易受海洋噪声干扰，而光信号虽不受噪声影响，但存在吸收和散射导致的衰减问题，需设计更高传输速率和更低衰减的光学系统。

Method: 采用多波长光源设计框架，重新定义针对蓝光的颜色键移（CSK）约束区域，并以4点水下CSK为例进行分析。

Result: 分析结果表明，所提方案在符号错误概率、可达速率和传输范围之间存在权衡关系。

Conclusion: 通过优化CSK设计，可在水下环境中实现更高效的光信号传输。

Abstract: Underwater optical wireless technologies offer multiple advantages over the
acoustic technology. Acoustic signals, for instance, are susceptible to noise
from marine sources due to marine life and human activities. This is not the
case with optical signals. However, absorption and scattering significantly
attenuate optical signals. This limits the communication range and requires
higher transmission power or more sensitive receivers to detect transmitted
light. Therefore, it is necessary to design underwater optical systems with a
higher transmission rate and reduced attenuation. To this end, we introduce a
framework for designing optical signaling constellations employing
multi-wavelength light sources to account for the transmission distance and
achievable rate. In particular, we redefine the color-shift keying (CSK)
constraint region to target blue light and adapt to marine environments. We
discuss an example of 4-point underwater CSK. The corresponding analytical
results demonstrate the trade-offs between the symbol error probability,
achievable rate, and transmission range of the proposed scheme.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个通用的机器学习（ML）框架，用于双向反馈信道编码，并对比了单向方案，展示了在特定信噪比（SNR）下的性能优势以及计算复杂度的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于单向反馈信道编码，而双向设置（两个用户通过共享信道相互编码和反馈）的研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种通用的ML架构，将几种流行的单向方案通过该框架转化为双向设置，并评估了三种前沿神经网络编码模型的计算开销和错误性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，ML双向编码在特定SNR范围内能显著降低错误率。

Conclusion: 双向反馈编码在ML框架下具有潜力，但需权衡计算开销与性能优化。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based feedback channel coding has garnered significant
research interest in the past few years. However, there has been limited
research exploring ML approaches in the so-called "two-way" setting where two
users jointly encode messages and feedback for each other over a shared
channel. In this work, we present a general architecture for ML-based two-way
feedback coding, and show how several popular one-way schemes can be converted
to the two-way setting through our framework. We compare such schemes against
their one-way counterparts, revealing error-rate benefits of ML-based two-way
coding in certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. We then analyze the
tradeoffs between error performance and computational overhead for three
state-of-the-art neural network coding models instantiated in the two-way
paradigm.

### [3] [Element-Grouping Strategy for Intelligent Reflecting Surface: Performance Analysis and Algorithm Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15520)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种智能元素分组的智能反射表面（IEG-IRS）方法，通过统计信道状态信息预先分组元素，并在实时优化中利用瞬时信道状态信息，解决了传统大规模IRS系统的高复杂性和高开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IRS方案需要大量反射元素来克服级联信道中的‘乘法衰落’，导致实时波束成形复杂性和信道估计开销过高。为克服这些瓶颈，论文提出了可持续的智能元素分组IRS。

Method: 基于统计CSI的智能分组策略将IRS元素划分为多个组，每组共享反射系数并利用瞬时CSI实时优化。同时分析XL-IRS在SU-SISO系统中的渐近性能，设计了MU-MISO系统下的两阶段优化算法。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，IEG-IRS能够显著提升信道容量，并在存在LoS时形成‘确定性虚拟LoS’通道，实现可持续的平方阵列增益。

Conclusion: IEG-IRS是一种高效且可持续的解决方案，显著降低了复杂性和开销，同时在大规模无线通信系统中提供了可观的性能增益。

Abstract: As a revolutionary paradigm for intelligently controlling wireless channels,
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technology for
future sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications. While IRS-aided
communication systems can achieve attractive high channel gains, existing
schemes require plenty of IRS elements to mitigate the ``multiplicative
fading'' effect in cascaded channels, leading to high complexity for real-time
beamforming and high signaling overhead for channel estimation. In this paper,
the concept of sustainable intelligent element-grouping IRS (IEG-IRS) is
proposed to overcome those fundamental bottlenecks. Specifically, based on the
statistical channel state information (S-CSI), the proposed grouping strategy
intelligently pre-divide the IEG-IRS elements into multiple groups based on the
beam-domain grouping method, with each group sharing the common reflection
coefficient and being optimized in real time using the instantaneous channel
state information (I-CSI). Then, we further analyze the asymptotic performance
of the IEG-IRS to reveal the substantial capacity gain in an extremely
large-scale IRS (XL-IRS) aided single-user single-input single-output (SU-SISO)
system. In particular, when a line-of-sight (LoS) component exists, it
demonstrates that the combined cascaded link can be considered as a
``deterministic virtual LoS'' channel, resulting in a sustainable squared array
gain achieved by the IEG-IRS. Finally, we formulate a weighted-sum-rate (WSR)
maximization problem for an IEG-IRS-aided multiuser multiple-input
single-output (MU-MISO) system and a two-stage algorithm for optimizing the
beam-domain grouping strategy and the multi-user active-passive beamforming is
proposed.

### [4] [Joint Security-Latency Design for Short Packet-Based Low-Altitude Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15628)
*Zeyin Wang,Di Zhang,Shaobo Jia,Lulu Song,Yanqun Tang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为“安全延迟”的新指标，分析了短包通信中SNR和数据块长度对延迟的影响，并提供了优化传输设计以减少平均SL的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对低空短包通信中窃听者靠近接收器的情况，研究SNR和数据块长度对通信延迟的影响，以提升通信的安全性和效率。

Method: 提出SL指标，推导ESP和平均SL的表达式，分析不同传输设计并优化SNR和数据块长度。

Result: 数值验证显示SNR和数据块长度是影响SL的主要因素，减少SNR可提升SL性能。

Conclusion: 通过优化SNR和数据块长度，可在保证安全性的同时有效降低通信延迟。

Abstract: In this article, a joint security and latency analysis of short packet-based
low-altitude communications when the eavesdropper is close to the receiver is
addressed. To reveal the impacts of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
block-length on latency in communications, we propose a new metric named secure
latency (SL) and derive the expressions for the effective secure probability
(ESP) and the average SL. To minimize the average SL, different transmission
designs are analyzed, in which the optimal solutions of SNR and block-length
are provided. Numerical results validate our analysis and reveal the trade-off
between reliability and security and the impacts of the block-length, SNR, and
packet-generating rate on average SL, of which SNR and the block-length account
for main factors. In addition, we find that the performance of SL can be
enhanced by allocating less SNR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G无线系统的发展，子太赫兹频段因其大带宽潜力受到关注，但其信道条件恶劣和硬件非线性问题需要高效的通信技术。OTFS技术因其在恶劣条件下的表现成为研究热点。

Method: 研究采用了Zak-OTFS技术，设计了扩散导频波形，实现了通信与感知的资源共存。研究还定义了系统模型和信号设计，并集成到了先进的子太赫兹无线测试平台上。

Conclusion: Zak-OTFS技术在子太赫兹频段展现出巨大潜力，扩散导频设计为6G通信系统提供了高效和低PAPR的解决方案，同时支持通信与感知的集成应用。

Abstract: Looking towards 6G wireless systems, frequency bands like the sub-terahertz
(sub-THz) band (100 GHz - 300 GHz) are gaining traction for their promises of
large available swaths of bandwidth to support the ever-growing data demands.
However, challenges with harsh channel conditions and hardware nonlinearities
in the sub-THz band require robust communication techniques with favorable
properties, such as good spectral efficiency and low peak-to-average power
ratio (PAPR). Recently, OTFS and its variants have garnered significant
attention for their performance in severe conditions (like high delay and
Doppler), making it a promising candidate for future communications. In this
work, we implement Zak-OTFS for the over-the-air experiments with traditional
point pilots and the new spread pilots. Notably, we design our spread-pilot
waveforms with communications and sensing coexisting in the same radio
resources. We define the system model and the signal design for integration
onto our state-of-the-art sub-THz wireless testbed. We show successful data
transmission over-the-air at 140 GHz and 240 GHz in a variety of
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In addition, we demonstrate integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) capabilities and show PAPR improvement of
over 5 dB with spread pilots compared to point pilots.

### [6] [DERD-Net: Learning Depth from Event-based Ray Densities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15863)
*Diego de Oliveira Hitzges,Suman Ghosh,Guillermo Gallego*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于事件相机的深度估计框架，通过处理异步事件数据并结合3D卷积与循环结构，显著提升了单目和立体视觉的深度估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习框架难以处理事件相机的异步数据流，需要一种更适合这种数据的深度估计方法。

Method: 使用DSI（Disparity Space Image）编码场景结构，通过3D卷积和循环神经网络处理局部子区域，实现高效并行计算。

Result: 在单目数据上表现媲美立体方法；在立体数据上误差降低至少42%；深度完整度提升3倍以上，中值误差降低至少30%。

Conclusion: 该框架具有成为事件相机深度估计和SLAM标准方法的潜力，性能和效率均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Event cameras offer a promising avenue for multi-view stereo depth estimation
and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) due to their ability to detect
blur-free 3D edges at high-speed and over broad illumination conditions.
However, traditional deep learning frameworks designed for conventional cameras
struggle with the asynchronous, stream-like nature of event data, as their
architectures are optimized for discrete, image-like inputs. We propose a
scalable, flexible and adaptable framework for pixel-wise depth estimation with
event cameras in both monocular and stereo setups. The 3D scene structure is
encoded into disparity space images (DSIs), representing spatial densities of
rays obtained by back-projecting events into space via known camera poses. Our
neural network processes local subregions of the DSIs combining 3D convolutions
and a recurrent structure to recognize valuable patterns for depth prediction.
Local processing enables fast inference with full parallelization and ensures
constant ultra-low model complexity and memory costs, regardless of camera
resolution. Experiments on standard benchmarks (MVSEC and DSEC datasets)
demonstrate unprecedented effectiveness: (i) using purely monocular data, our
method achieves comparable results to existing stereo methods; (ii) when
applied to stereo data, it strongly outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches, reducing the mean absolute error by at least 42%; (iii) our method
also allows for increases in depth completeness by more than 3-fold while still
yielding a reduction in median absolute error of at least 30%. Given its
remarkable performance and effective processing of event-data, our framework
holds strong potential to become a standard approach for using deep learning
for event-based depth estimation and SLAM. Project page:

Abstract: Key performance indicators (KPIs), which can be extracted from the
standardized interfaces of network equipment defined by current standards,
constitute a primary data source that can be leveraged in the development of
non-standardized new equipment, architectures, and computational tools. In
next-generation technologies, the demand for data has evolved beyond the
conventional log generation or export capabilities provided by existing

the development of real-time KPI extraction methods and enabling their exchange
between both standardized/commercialized and non-standardized components or
tools has become increasingly critical. This study presents a comprehensive
evaluation of three distinct KPI extraction methodologies applied to two
commercially available devices. The analysis aims to uncover the strengths,
weaknesses, and overall efficacy of these approaches under varying conditions,
and highlights the critical insights into the practical capabilities and
limitations. The findings serve as a foundational guide for the seamless
integration and robust testing of novel technologies and approaches within
commercial telecommunication networks. This work aspires to bridge the gap
between technological innovation and real-world applicability, fostering
enhanced decision-making in network deployment and optimization.

Abstract: With the continued growth of its core technologies, including the Internet of
Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data and data analytics, and
edge computing, digital twin (DT) technology has witnessed a significant
increase in industrial applications, helping the industry become more
sustainable, smart, and adaptable. Hence, DT technology has emerged as a
promising link between the physical and virtual worlds, enabling simulation,
prediction, and real-time performance optimization. This work aims to explore
the development of a high-fidelity digital twin framework, focusing on
synchronization and accuracy between physical and digital systems to enhance
data-driven decision making. To achieve this, we deploy several stationary UAVs
in optimized locations to collect data from industrial IoT devices, which were
used to monitor multiple physical entities and perform computations to evaluate
their status. We consider a practical setup in which multiple IoT devices may
monitor a single physical entity, and as a result, the measurements are
combined and processed together to determine the status of the physical entity.
The resulting status updates are subsequently uploaded from the UAVs to the
base station, where the DT resides. In this work, we consider a novel metric
based on the Age of Information (AoI), coined as the Age of Digital Twin
(AoDT), to reflect the status freshness of the digital twin. Factoring AoDT in
the problem formulation ensures that the DT reliably mirrors the physical
system with high accuracy and synchronization. We formulate a mixed-integer
non-convex program to maximize the total amount of data collected from all IoT
devices while ensuring a constrained AoDT. Using successive convex
approximations, we solve the problem, conduct extensive simulations and compare
the results with baseline approaches to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed solution.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了堆叠智能超表面（SIM）在多天线基站中的应用，提出了一个混合预编码框架以最大化能效（EE），并通过算法优化验证了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SIM在未来无线通信系统中的潜力，特别是在多用户下行链路中的应用，并解决其能效优化问题。

Method: 采用二次变换方法重新表述优化问题，提出基于交替优化（AO）的联合预编码框架，结合SCA算法设计基站预编码，使用SDP和PGA算法优化SIM波束成形。

Result: 2至5层SIM设计在能效和频谱效率之间取得平衡，算法显著提升了性能表现。

Conclusion: 提出的混合预编码框架有效提升了SIM辅助系统的性能，为未来通信系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), comprising multiple layers of
reconfigurable transmissive metasurfaces, is becoming an increasingly viable
solution for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we explore
the integration of SIM in a multi-antenna base station for application to
downlink multi-user communications, and a realistic power consumption model for
SIM-assisted systems is presented. Specifically, we focus on maximizing the
energy efficiency (EE) for hybrid precoding design, i.e., the base station
digital precoding and SIM wave-based beamforming. Due to the non-convexity and
high complexity of the formulated problem, we employ the quadratic
transformation method to reformulate the optimization problem and propose an
alternating optimization (AO)-based joint precoding framework. Specifically, a
successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is adopted for the base station
precoding design. For the SIM wave-based beamforming, two algorithms are
employed: the high-performance semidefinite programming (SDP) method and the
low-complexity projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm. In particular, the
results indicate that while the optimal number of SIM layers for maximizing the
EE and spectral efficiency differs, a design of 2 to 5 layers can achieve
satisfactory performance for both. Finally, numerical results are illustrated
to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid precoding framework and to
showcase the performance enhancement achieved by the algorithm in comparison to
benchmark schemes.

Conclusion: 本文提出的EM-compliant模型及优化方案有效解决了主动RIS的电磁特性与系统性能的冲突，为6G通信中的RIS技术提供了更现实的建模框架。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent a transformative
technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications, but it suffers
from a significant limitation, namely the double-fading attenuation. Active RIS
has emerged as a promising solution, effectively mitigating the attenuation
issues associated with conventional RIS-assisted systems. However, the current
academic work on active RIS focuses on the system-level optimization of active
RIS, often overlooking the development of models that are compatible with its
electromagnetic (EM) and physical properties. The challenge of constructing
realistic, EM-compliant models for active RIS-assisted communication, as well
as understanding their implications on system-level optimization, remains an
open research area. To tackle these problems, in this paper we develop a novel
EM-compliant model with mutual coupling (MC) for active RIS-assisted wireless
systems by integrating the developed scattering-parameter ($S$-parameter) based
active RIS framework with multiport network theory, which facilitates
system-level analysis and optimization. To evaluate the performance of the
EM-compliant active RIS model, we design the joint optimization scheme based on
the transmit beamforming at the transmitter and the reflection coefficient at
the active RIS to maximize the achievable rate of EM-compliant active
RIS-assisted MIMO system. To tackle the inherent non-convexity of this problem,
we employ the Sherman-Morrison inversion and Neumann series (SMaN)-based
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Simulation results verified that EM
property (i.e., MC effect) is an indispensable factor in the optimization
process of MIMO systems. Neglecting this effect introduces a substantial
performance gap, highlighting its significance in the more pronounced the MC
effect is, the greater the gap in achievable rates.

### [12] [A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Efficient Finite-Length LDPC Code Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16071)
*Ata Tanrıkulu,Mete Yıldırım,Ahmed Hareedy*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）方法，用于优化低密度奇偶校验（LDPC）码的有限长度设计，特别是针对短循环的消除。通过理论分析和仿真验证，证明该方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LDPC码在现代存储和通信系统中表现优异，但现有的有限长度优化方法效率较低，尤其在处理短循环时。因此，需要一种更高效的方法来优化代码设计。

Method: 提出了一种基于MCMC的优化方法，通过采样逐渐减少短循环的分布来优化分区和提升安排。理论证明了马尔可夫链的不变性，并通过仿真拟合高斯分布进一步验证。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法生成的SC码短循环数量显著减少，且所需时间比现有方法少几个数量级。

Conclusion: 所提出的MCMC方法在LDPC码设计中高效且性能优越，尤其适用于有限长度优化问题。

Abstract: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent
error-correction schemes. They find application to fortify various modern
storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes
offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and
decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD)
circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient
finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the
available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD
relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC
or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of
short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution
where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous
iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the
invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible
partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the
distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a
Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to
the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of
iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the
size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code
design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our
MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles
compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number
of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared
with the available literature methods.

Three-dimensional (3D) panoramic imaging of the vasculature is generally not
practical in conventional ultrasonography with limited field-of-view (FOV)
probes, and PAT does not provide sufficient scattering-based soft tissue
morphological contrast. Complementing each other, fast panoramic rotational
ultrasound tomography (RUST) and PAT are integrated for hybrid rotational
ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography (RUS-PAT), which obtains 3D ultrasound
structural and PAT angiographic images of the human body quasi-simultaneously.
The RUST functionality is achieved in a cost-effective manner using a
single-element ultrasonic transducer for ultrasound transmission and rotating
arc-shaped arrays for 3D panoramic detection. RUST is superior to conventional
ultrasonography, which either has a limited FOV with a linear array or is
high-cost with a hemispherical array that requires both transmission and
receiving. By switching the acoustic source to a light source, the system is
conveniently converted to PAT mode to acquire angiographic images in the same
region. Using RUS-PAT, we have successfully imaged the human head, breast,
hand, and foot with a 10 cm diameter FOV, submillimeter isotropic resolution,
and 10 s imaging time for each modality. The 3D RUS-PAT is a powerful tool for
high-speed, 3D, dual-contrast imaging of the human body with potential for
rapid clinical translation.
