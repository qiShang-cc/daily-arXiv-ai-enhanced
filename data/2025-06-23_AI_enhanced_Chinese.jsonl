At each time t, normal processes are in state zero (normal\nstate), while the abnormal process may be in either state zero (normal state)\nor state one (abnormal state), with the states being hidden. The transition\nbetween states for the abnormal process is governed by a Markov chain over\ntime. At each time step, observations can be drawn from a selected subset of\nprocesses. Each probed process generates an observation depending on its hidden\nstate, either a typical distribution under state zero or an abnormal\ndistribution under state one. The objective is to design a sequential search\nstrategy that minimizes the expected detection time, subject to an error\nprobability constraint. In contrast to prior works that assume i.i.d.\nobservations, we address a new setting where anomalies evolve according to a\nhidden Markov model. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm, dubbed Anomaly\nDetection under Hidden Markov model (ADHM), which dynamically adapts the\nprobing strategy based on accumulated statistical evidence and predictive\nbelief updates over hidden states. ADHM effectively leverages temporal\ncorrelations to focus sensing resources on the most informative processes.

To satisfy low-latency and high-computation demands, the\nintegration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)\nsystems plays a vital role, which offloads computing tasks from terminal\ndevices to nearby UAVs, enabling flexible and resilient service provisions for\nground users. To promote the development of LAENets, it is significant to\nachieve low-carbon multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks.

To this\nend, this paper proposes a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based\nLarge Language Model (LLM) agent framework for model formulation. Specifically,\nwe develop HybridRAG by combining KeywordRAG, VectorRAG, and GraphRAG,\nempowering LLM agents to efficiently retrieve structural information from\nexpert databases and generate more accurate optimization problems compared with\ntraditional RAG-based LLM agents. After customizing carbon emission\noptimization problems for multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks, we propose a Double\nRegularization Diffusion-enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (R\\textsuperscript{2}DSAC)\nalgorithm to solve the formulated multi-objective optimization problem.

However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and\nprone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for\nautomated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations\nin ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable models. ECG signals\ncan vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow\ndifferent labeling standards and may be biased, all of which greatly hinder\nsupervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component\nanalysis, prioritize large (and often obvious) variances in the data and\ntypically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. If labels are\nmissing and/or variations are significant but small, both approaches fail.\nHere, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) can accommodate\nthese issues and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals, with no\nneed for training or prior information. Using the MLII and V1 leads of the\nMIT-BIH dataset, we demonstrate that t-distributed stochastic neighbor\nembedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection can discriminate\nindividual recordings in mixed populations with >= 90% accuracy and distinguish\ndifferent arrhythmias in individual patients with a median accuracy of 98.96%\nand a median F1-score of 91.02%.
