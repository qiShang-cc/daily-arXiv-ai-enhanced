The\ninability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their\nover-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards\ngeneral-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models\n(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the\nreal-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research\nprogress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of\nfirst-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,\nthis study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their\nmethodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that\nmost EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on\ntransformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for\nself-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely\nlimited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.\nIn addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work\nshould demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and\ntrustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We\nbelieve that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies,\nand applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the\ntranslational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs."}

The path loss analysis across different Rx\nshows that the close-in model outperforms conventional 3GPP models and\nheight-corrected variants, with path loss exponents close to free space values\nindicating line-of-sight dominance. The power angular spectrum measurements\nshow that propagation behavior varies significantly with environmental\nconditions.

The\ndesign is separated into two problems: beamforming-aware UAV placement\noptimization and transceiver design for minimum SINR maximization. A\nsignificant challenge in beamforming-aware UAV placement optimization is the\nlack of instantaneous channel state information (CSI) prior to deploying UAV\nrelays, making it difficult to derive the beamforming SINR in non-orthogonal\nmulti-user transmission. To address this issue, an approximation of the\nexpected beamforming SINR is derived using the narrow beam property of a\nmassive MIMO base station.

This paper introduces time-frequency mode decomposition\n(TFMD), a novel framework for the fast, robust, and adaptive decomposition of\nsuch signals. TFMD operates on the principle that modes form contiguous\nhigh-energy regions in the time-frequency domain. Its non-iterative pipeline\nreframes signal decomposition as an image segmentation task: a signal is\ntransformed into a spectrogram, which is then smoothed to enhance the\ncontinuity of these high-energy regions. A sequence of adaptive thresholding\nand connected-component labeling with size-based filtering is then employed to\nautomatically segment the spectrogram and generate a mask for each mode. The\nmodes are finally reconstructed via the inverse short-time Fourier transform.\nValidation on diverse synthetic signals demonstrates that TFMD accurately\ndetermines the number of modes and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Its\nperformance is particularly strong in high-noise conditions. A comparative\nanalysis confirms that TFMD provides robust, competitive performance across a\nwider variety of signal types, while a theoretical complexity analysis reveals\nits superior computational efficiency stemming from its non-iterative design.\nThe method's practical utility is further demonstrated by successfully\nextracting modal responses from a real-world footbridge vibration signal.

Radio Frequency Fingerprint\nIdentification (RFFI) offers a non-cryptographic solution by exploiting\nhardware-induced signal distortions. This paper proposes HyDRA, a Hybrid\nDual-mode RF Architecture that integrates an optimized Variational Mode\nDecomposition (VMD) with a novel architecture based on the fusion of\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and Mamba components,\ndesigned to support both closed-set and open-set classification tasks. The\noptimized VMD enhances preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy by\nfixing center frequencies and using closed-form solutions. HyDRA employs the\nTransformer Dynamic Sequence Encoder (TDSE) for global dependency modeling and\nthe Mamba Linear Flow Encoder (MLFE) for linear-complexity processing, adapting\nto varying conditions. Evaluation on public datasets demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in closed-set scenarios and robust performance\nin our proposed open-set classification method, effectively identifying\nunauthorized devices. Deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, HyDRA achieves\nmillisecond-level inference speed with low power consumption, providing a\npractical solution for real-time wireless authentication in real-world\nenvironments."}

While hippocampal\nneurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale\nneural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during\nnaturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we\ndemonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces\n(BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous,\nfine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and\norientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited\nspatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent\nvisual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable\nspatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of\nspatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is\npresented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with\nintrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation\nthrough a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing\nto position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed\nyet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the\nbrain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under\npassive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and\npassive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the\nautomatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding\nof how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured\ninternal representations."}
