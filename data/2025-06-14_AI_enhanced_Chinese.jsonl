Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and\nreliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents\nand increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this\ncontext is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the\nreliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter\nvariations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may\naffect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In\nthis work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel\nimbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean\nsquares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to\nestimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected\ntargets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior\nknowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in\ncombination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed\nmethod suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the\nnormal operation of the radar. Furthermore, it features reduced dependency on\nspecific targets of interest and faster update rates of the channel imbalance\nestimation compared to the majority of state-of-the-art methods. This\nimprovement is achieved by allowing for multiple targets in the angular\nspectrum, whereas most other methods are restricted to only single targets in\nthe angular spectrum.

Despite their excellent BER characteristics, these\ncodes exhibit suboptimal block error rate (BLER) performance, creating a\nfundamental BER-BLER trade-off that severely limits their practical deployment\nin communication systems. This paper introduces DeepPolar+, an enhanced neural\npolar coding framework that systematically eliminates this BER-BLER trade-off\nby simultaneously improving BLER performance while maintaining the superior BER\ncharacteristics of DeepPolar codes. Our approach achieves this breakthrough\nthrough three key innovations: (1) an attention-enhanced decoder architecture\nthat leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture complex\ndependencies between bit positions, (2) a structured loss function that jointly\noptimizes for both bit-level accuracy and block-level reliability, and (3) an\nadaptive SNR-Matched Redundancy Technique (SMART) for decoding DeepPolar+ code\n(DP+SMART decoder) that combines specialized models with CRC verification for\nrobust performance across diverse channel conditions. For a (256,37) code\nconfiguration, DeepPolar+ demonstrates notable improvements in both BER and\nBLER performance compared to conventional successive cancellation decoding and\nDeepPolar, while achieving remarkably faster convergence through improved\narchitecture and optimization strategies. The DeepPolar+SMART variant further\namplifies these dual improvements, delivering significant gains in both error\nrate metrics over existing approaches.
