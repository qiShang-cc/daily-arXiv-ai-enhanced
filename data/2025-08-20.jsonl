They are identified through certain\ndistinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.\nTraditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,\nwhich has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods\nspecialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.\nHowever, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on\ncentralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,\netc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These\nassumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described\ninformally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for\ncomparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners\nto find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc\nrepresentation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting\nto start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own\ntaxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research\nmoving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a\nwell-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly."}

Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly\nfocus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge\nof the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory.

Manual hole inspection is slow\nand expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological\nproperties of the holes and their contents.

We present a\nrobust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based\nnavigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first\nprocesses point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting\nthe cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground.

It is\nnow a standard tool for trajectory tracking control of automated vehicles. As\nsuch it has been used in many research and development projects. However, MPC\nfaces several challenges to be integrated into industrial production vehicles.\nThe most important ones are its high computational demands and the complexity\nof implementation. The software packages AutoMPC aims to address both of these\nchallenges. It builds on a robustified version of an active set algorithm for\nNonlinear MPC. The algorithm is embedded into a framework for vehicle\ntrajectory tracking, which makes it easy to used, yet highly customizable.\nAutomatic code generation transforms the selections into a standalone,\ncomputationally efficient C-code file with static memory allocation. As such it\ncan be readily deployed on a wide range of embedded platforms, e.g., based on\nMatlab/Simulink or Robot Operating System (ROS). Compared to a previous version\nof the code, the vehicle model and the numerical integration method can be\nmanually specified, besides basic algorithm parameters. All of this information\nand all specifications are directly baked into the generated C-code. The\nalgorithm is suitable driving scenarios at low or high speeds, even drifting,\nand supports direction changes. Multiple simulation scenarios show the\nversatility and effectiveness of the AutoMPC code, with the guarantee of a\nfeasible solution, a high degree of robustness, and computational efficiency."}

Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,\ninteract with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range\nperception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent\nmodels generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to\nhousehold-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a\ndataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial\nenvironments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects\nacross static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific\nto mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object\nconfigurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion\npatterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in\nthese settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a\nfoundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to\nthe demands of mobile robotics.

Any\nmobility analysis of a particular mechanism amounts to investigating the\nc-space geometry at a given configuration. A higher-order analysis is necessary\nto determine the finite mobility. To this end, past research lead to approaches\nusing higher-order time derivatives of loop closure constraints assuming\n(implicitly) that all possible motions are smooth. This continuity assumption\nlimits the generality of these methods. In this paper an approach to the\nhigher-order local mobility analysis of lower pair multi-loop linkages is\npresented. This is based on a higher-order Taylor series expansion of the\ngeometric constraint mapping, for which a recursive algebraic expression in\nterms of joint screws is presented. An exhaustive local analysis includes\nanalysis of the set of constraint singularities (configurations where the\nconstraint Jacobian has certain corank). A local approximation of the set of\nconfigurations with certain rank is presented, along with an explicit\nexpression for the differentials of Jacobian minors in terms of instantaneous\njoint screws. The c-space and the set of points of certain corank are therewith\nlocally approximated by an algebraic variety determined algebraically from the\nmechanism's screw system. Results are shown for a simple planar 4-bar linkage,\nwhich exhibits a bifurcation singularity, and for a planar three-loop linkage\nexhibiting a cusp in c-space. The latter cannot be treated by the higher-order\nlocal analysis methods proposed in the literature."}
