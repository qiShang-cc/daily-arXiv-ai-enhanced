<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可重构天线技术在6G及以上无线通信中实时优化系数以重塑无线传播环境的挑战。

Conclusion: 零阶优化在可重构天线技术中具有潜力，未来研究方向值得探讨。

Abstract: Reconfigurable antennas, including reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS),
movable antenna (MA), fluid antenna (FA), and other advanced antenna
techniques, have been studied extensively in the context of reshaping wireless
propagation environments for 6G and beyond wireless communications.
Nevertheless, how to reconfigure/optimize the real-time controllable
coefficients to achieve a favorable end-to-end wireless channel remains a
substantial challenge, as it usually requires accurate modeling of the complex
interaction between the reconfigurable devices and the electromagnetic waves,
as well as knowledge of implicit channel propagation parameters. In this paper,
we introduce a derivative-free optimization (a.k.a., zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization) technique to directly optimize reconfigurable coefficients to
shape the wireless end-to-end channel, without the need of channel modeling and
estimation of the implicit environmental propagation parameters. We present the
fundamental principles of ZO optimization and discuss its potential advantages
in wireless channel reconfiguration. Two case studies for RIS and movable
antenna-enabled single-input single-output (SISO) systems are provided to show
the superiority of ZO-based methods as compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
Finally, we outline promising future research directions and offer concluding
insights on derivative-free optimization for reconfigurable antenna
technologies.

*Eric Mason,Sippanon Kitimoon,Hrushikesh Mhaskar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的信号分离方法，用于在低信噪比、交叉和不连续情况下分离线性调频信号，并分析了噪声下信号分离算子的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信号处理中叠加信号分离的挑战，特别是在低信噪比、交叉和不连续情况下的线性调频信号分离问题。

Method: 通过扩展现有的信号分离算子（SSO）方法，提出改进算法，并在理论分析中研究了最小分离度、最小振幅、信噪比和采样频率的关系。

Result: 在包含7个模拟信号的测试数据集上进行了验证，展示了改进方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的改进方法能够有效应对复杂信号分离问题，尤其是低信噪比和不连续性带来的挑战。

Abstract: The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual
components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing
applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous
paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator
(SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such
superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In
this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp
signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We
give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to
examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude,
SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and
numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated
signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在单一系统中同时实现高效通信与雷达感知的技术，以提升系统集成度和效率。

Abstract: This study examines an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
transceiver featuring a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable
intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and a receiver equipped with a passive
electronically scanned array (PESA) and a single digital channel. By utilizing
a periodic pulsed signal emitted by a feeder, we introduce at the STAR-RIS a
space modulation to illuminate two angular directions observed by the radar
receiver, one in each half-space, and a time modulation to distinguish the
corresponding echoes from prospective moving targets and embed communication
messages. The proposed time modulation employs orthogonal binary codebooks with
different trade-offs in transmission and error rates, while having minimal
impact on the radar performance, evaluated by probability of detection and root
mean square error in the radial velocity estimation.

### [4] [Joint Radiation Power, Antenna Position, and Beamforming Optimization for Pinching-Antenna Systems with Motion Power Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02348)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了考虑天线运动功耗和可调辐射功率的Pinching-天线系统（PASS）设计，通过联合优化天线位置、辐射功率比和发射波束成形，以最小化功耗并满足服务质量（QoS）要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽略了天线放置的物理约束和固定辐射功率的假设，因此需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出了一种基于ADMM的框架解决连续天线移动问题，并将离散天线移动问题建模为MINLP问题并使用BCD方法求解。

Result: 仿真结果显示，考虑天线运动功耗和可调辐射功率的PASS设计显著提升了性能，并验证了优化框架的效率。

Conclusion: PASS在减轻大规模路径损耗和用户间干扰方面优于传统MIMO系统。

Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have been recently proposed to improve the
performance of wireless networks by reconfiguring both the large-scale and
small-scale channel conditions. However, existing studies ignore the physical
constraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To
fill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into
account the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact
of adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average
power consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly
optimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit
beamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to
consider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional
degree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and
discrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the
fact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the
channel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To
tackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for
continuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a
mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block
coordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance
enhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and
adjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the
efficiency of the proposed optimization framework. The benefits of PASS over
conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in mitigating the
large-scale path loss and inter-user interference is also revealed.

Abstract: This study considers a base station equipped with sensing and communication
capabilities, which serves a ground user and scans a portion of the sky via a
passive reconfigurable intelligent surface. To achieve more favorable system
tradeoffs, we utilize a multi-frame radar detector, comprising a detector, a
plot-extractor, and a track-before-detect processor. The main idea proposed
here is that user spectral efficiency can be enhanced by increasing the number
of scans jointly processed by the multi-frame radar detector while maintaining
the same sensing performance. A numerical analysis is conducted to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed solution and to evaluate the achievable system
tradeoffs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了低空无线网络（LAWNs）中无人机通过有限块长度传输为多个移动自动导引车（AGVs）提供实时无线控制的方法，结合模型预测控制（MPC）和优化框架，显著提升了控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空无线网络（LAWNs）在物联网（IoT）系统中具有潜力，但实时无线控制面临挑战，尤其是通过无人机为多个移动AGV提供服务时的可靠性和效率问题。

Method: 通过模型预测控制（MPC）确保轨迹跟踪准确性，分析通信可靠性并优化控制策略、功率分配和无人机轨迹，采用交替优化（AO）框架和高效算法求解非凸问题。

Result: 仿真和实验验证了所提方法在控制性能上的优越性，显著优于基线方案。

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化框架能有效解决LAWNs中无人机控制AGV的复杂问题，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have been envisioned as flexible and
transformative platforms for enabling delay-sensitive control applications in
Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In this work, we investigate the real-time
wireless control over a LAWN system, where an aerial drone is employed to serve
multiple mobile automated guided vehicles (AGVs) via finite blocklength (FBL)
transmission. Toward this end, we adopt the model predictive control (MPC) to
ensure accurate trajectory tracking, while we analyze the communication
reliability using the outage probability. Subsequently, we formulate an
optimization problem to jointly determine control policy, transmit power
allocation, and drone trajectory by accounting for the maximum travel distance
and control input constraints. To address the resultant non-convex optimization
problem, we first derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability
under FBL transmission. Based on this, we reformulate the original problem as a
quadratic programming (QP) problem, followed by developing an alternating
optimization (AO) framework. Specifically, we employ the projected gradient
descent (PGD) method and the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to
achieve computationally efficient sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, we
thoroughly analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed
algorithm. Extensive simulations and AirSim-based experiments are conducted to
validate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to the baseline
schemes in terms of control performance.

### [7] [Parameter estimation of range-migrating targets using OTFS signals from LEO satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02385)
*Tong Ding,Luca Venturino,Emanuele Grossi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了基于OTFS调制的LEO卫星通信系统，用于估计高速空间目标的参数，提出了一种新型输入输出模型及最大似然估计器实现方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高速移动目标在ISAC系统中的参数估计问题，尤其是由距离迁移引起的信号扩展。

Method: 利用OTFS收发器的信号处理特性，建立目标响应的稀疏结构模型，采用块正交匹配追踪和匹配滤波器组进行参数估计。

Result: 目标响应在延迟多普勒域呈现稀疏结构，提出的估计方法能有效解决距离迁移引起的信号扩展问题。

Conclusion: 通过数值实验验证了所提方法的有效性，为高速目标的ISAC系统提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: This study investigates a communication-centric integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system that utilizes orthogonal time frequency space
(OTFS) modulated signals emitted by low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to
estimate the parameters of space targets experiencing range migration,
henceforth referred to as high-speed targets. Leveraging the specific signal
processing performed by OTFS transceivers, we derive a novel input-output model
for the echo generated by a high-speed target in scenarios where ideal and
rectangular shaping filters are employed. Our findings reveal that the target
response exhibits a sparse structure in the delay-Doppler domain, dependent
solely upon the initial range and range-rate; notably, range migration causes a
spread in the target response, marking a significant departure from previous
studies. Utilizing this signal structure, we propose an approximate
implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the target's initial
range, range-rate, and amplitude. The estimation process involves obtaining
coarse information on the target response using a block orthogonal matching
pursuit algorithm, followed by a refinement step using a bank of matched
filters focused on a smaller range and range-rate region. Finally, numerical
examples are provided to evaluate the estimation performance.

### [8] [When Attention is Beneficial for Learning Wireless Resource Allocation Efficiently?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02427)
*Jia Guo,Chenyang Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了注意力机制在资源分配中是否必要，并通过分析集合上的函数结构和数值算法，提出了一种设计GNN的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是为了验证注意力机制在资源分配中的必要性，并探索如何结合GNN的结构设计以提高学习效率。

Method: 通过递归表达集合上的置换等变函数，并将其应用于资源分配问题的数值算法中，分析是否需要注意力机制。

Result: 研究发现，当干扰未被反映在可测量参数中时，需要使用注意力机制建模干扰。基于此，提出了一个设计GNN的框架。

Conclusion: 论文结论表明，通过结构与算法对齐设计的GNN在学习效率上表现良好，并通过仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Owing to the use of attention mechanism to leverage the dependency across
tokens, Transformers are efficient for natural language processing. By
harnessing permutation properties broadly exist in resource allocation
policies, each mapping measurable environmental parameters (e.g., channel
matrix) to optimized variables (e.g., precoding matrix), graph neural networks
(GNNs) are promising for learning these policies efficiently in terms of
scalability and generalizability. To reap the benefits of both architectures,
there is a recent trend of incorporating attention mechanism with GNNs for
learning wireless policies. Nevertheless, is the attention mechanism really
needed for resource allocation? In this paper, we strive to answer this
question by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical
algorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are
induced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the
permutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed
by two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not. We
proceed to re-express the numerical algorithms for optimizing several
representative resource allocation problems in recursive forms. We find that
when interference (say multi-user or inter-data stream interference) is not
reflected in the measurable parameters of a policy, attention needs to be used
to model the interference. With the insight, we establish a framework of
designing GNNs by aligning with the structures. By taking reconfigurable
intelligent surface-aided hybrid precoding as an example, the learning
efficiency of the proposed GNN is validated via simulations.

### [9] [Corrections to Published Values of Frequency Sampling Filter Transition Coefficients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02556)
*C. S. Ramalingam*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文纠正了Rabiner等人和Lyons书中关于频率采样滤波器（FSF）设计的过渡系数和峰值旁瓣水平（PSL）的错误值，并提供了通过作者程序优化后的正确数值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为Rabiner等人和Lyons的书中关于FSF设计的过渡系数和PSL值存在差异且不准确，作者希望通过自己的程序优化并提供正确的数值。

Method: 作者使用自己的程序对Rabiner等人和Lyons书中列出的低通和带通滤波器的过渡系数和PSL值进行了优化计算。

Result: 作者找到了过渡系数和PSL的最优值，例如对于$N=16$和BW$=4$的最优过渡系数为$0.40474097$，纠正了之前文献中的错误。

Conclusion: 本文提供了FSF设计中更准确的过渡系数和PSL值，纠正了现有文献中的错误，为相关研究提供了可靠的参考。

Abstract: Tables of optimal transition coefficients and peak sidelobe level (PSL, in
dB) associated with frequency sampling filter (FSF) design were published by
Rabiner et al. (Jun 1970), and reproduced, for example, in the book Digital
Signal Processing by Proakis and Manolakis (4/e, 2007). A set of values are
also given in Appendix H of Understanding Digital Signal Processing} by Lyons
(3/e, 2011), but there are significant differences between these two sets. For
example, for $N=16$ and BW$=4$, two different transition coefficient values
have been reported, viz., $0.38916626$ (Rabiner, et al.) and $0.34918551$
(Lyons). Neither is optimal, for we find the optimum value to be $0.40474097$.
The published values of the corresponding PSLs were also found to be incorrect.
In this paper we give the optimal values of the transition coefficients and PSL
values as estimated by our program for the lowpass and bandpass filters listed
in Rabiner et al. and Lyons.

### [10] [Pinching-Antenna-Assisted Index Modulation: Channel Modeling, Transceiver Design, and Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02641)
*Shuaixin Yang,Yijia Li,Yue Xiao,Yong Liang Guan,Xianfu Lei,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的夹持天线辅助索引调制（PA-IM）方案，以提高频谱效率而不增加硬件复杂度，通过综合收发器设计解决了检测和优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高频谱效率而不增加硬件复杂度，提出了一种新方案，将信息比特同时通过QAM符号和天线位置模式索引传输。

Method: 1. 建立了完整信道模型；2. 设计了低复杂度的BOSD算法；3. 推导了BER上限；4. 使用流形优化设计新的预编码方法。

Result: 仿真表明，PA-IM方案性能显著优于传统方案，预编码设计显著降低了BER。

Conclusion: PA-IM方案及配套设计在提升频谱效率和降低BER方面表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel pinching-antenna assisted index modulation (PA-IM)
scheme is proposed for improving the spectral efficiency without increasing the
hardware complexity, where the information bits are conveyed not only by the
conventional M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols but also by
the indices of pinching antenna (PA) position patterns. To realize the full
potential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver
design, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and
performance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel
model is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the
deterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of
wireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading.
Next, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML)
detection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is
designed, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML
performance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER)
is derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding
method is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by
jointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the
waveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all
received signal points. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed PA-IM scheme attains a significant performance gain over its
conventional counterparts and that the overall BER of the pinching-antenna
system is substantially improved by the proposed precoding design.

*Jiazhe Li,Nicolò Decarli,Francesco Guidi,Heng Dong,Anna Guerra,Alessandro Bazzi,Zhuoming Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出交替残差消除算法（AREE），解决毫米波通信中混合波束成形问题，通过分解为低维子问题实现快速收敛和高频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合波束成形在毫米波通信中广泛应用，但其模拟和数字预编码器的耦合限制了计算和频谱效率，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 采用AREE算法，将问题分解为两个低维子问题，通过迭代消除残差实现解耦，并结合低复杂度几何信道SVD算法。

Result: 仿真结果显示AREE算法能高效解耦预编码器，快速收敛，频谱效率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AREE算法在混合波束成形中表现出优越性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Hybrid beamforming has been widely employed in mmWave communications such as
vehicular-to-everything (V2X) scenarios, as a compromise between hardware
complexity and spectral efficiency. However, the inherent coupling between
analog and digital precoders in hybrid array architecture significantly limits
the computational and spectral efficiency of existing algorithms. To address
this issue, we propose an alternating residual error elimination (AREE)
algorithm, which decomposes the hybrid beamforming problem into two
low-dimensional subproblems, each exhibiting a favorable matrix structure that
enables effective decoupling of analog and digital precoders from the matrix
product formulation. These subproblems iteratively eliminate each other's
residual errors, driving the original problem toward the optimal hybrid
beamforming performance. The proposed initialization ensures rapid convergence,
while a low-complexity geometric channel SVD algorithm is developed by
transforming the high-dimensional sparse channel into a low-dimensional
equivalent, thereby simplifying the derivation of subproblems. Simulation
results demonstrate that the AREE algorithm effectively decouples analog and
digital precoders with low complexity, achieves fast convergence, and offers
higher spectral efficiency than existing beamforming methods.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在毫米波MIMO系统中使用可重构智能表面（RIS）优化预编码设计，以提高吞吐量。通过深度神经网络（DNN）替代传统的高计算复杂度的搜索方法，实现了高效的码字选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波MIMO系统中，由于直接通信路径受阻，需要利用RIS增强传输性能。传统方法计算复杂度高，难以实用。

Method: 采用离散傅里叶变换向量和DNN相结合的方法，优化码本设计和码字选择。

Result: 仿真表明，DNN在测试阶段即使终端与RIS距离变化，仍能保持次优频谱效率。

Conclusion: DNN在RIS辅助系统中具有显著潜力，能够高效解决复杂码字选择问题。

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

Conclusion: 结论是提出的技术在实际未知环境中具有操作可行性，且模型精度差异对实际性能影响有限。

Abstract: Physics-consistent theoretical studies on RIS-parametrized wireless channels
use models from multiport-network theory (MNT) to capture mutual-coupling (MC)
effects. However, in practice, RIS design and radio environment are partially
or completely unknown. We fill a research gap on how to estimate the MNT model
parameters in such experimentally relevant scenarios. Our technique efficiently
combines closed-form and gradient-descent steps, and it can be applied to
multi-bit-programmable RIS elements. We discuss inevitable (but operationally
irrelevant) parameter ambiguities. We experimentally validate our technique in
an unknown rich-scattering environment parametrized by eight 8-bit-programmable
RIS elements of unknown design. We experimentally evaluate the performance of
RIS configurations optimized with the estimated MNT model and an MC-unaware
cascaded model. While the models differ in accuracy by up to 17 dB, the
end-to-end performance differences are small.

*Sunder Ram Krishnan*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对α稳定随机投影的受限拟凸等距性质（RQIP），并推导了其所需矩阵行数的下限，结果表明RIP框架在实际中可能需要其他稀疏恢复方法替代。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究α稳定随机投影的稀疏恢复问题，探索RIP框架的局限性并提出替代方案。

Method: 利用对称α稳定分布的变量性质，结合稀疏ℓα球的覆盖数界限，推导RQIP的行数下限。

Result: 证明了RQIP的样本复杂度与多项式尾行为相关，支持实际中需采用基于零空间性质等其他稀疏恢复方法。

Conclusion: RQIP为稀疏恢复提供了新视角，表明传统RIP框架在实际中的局限性，需进一步探索替代方案。

Abstract: We formulate a generalization of the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)
referred to as the Restricted Quasiconvexity Isometry Property (RQIP) for alpha
stable random projections with $0<\alpha<1$. A lower bound on the number of
rows for RQIP to hold for random matrices whose entries are drawn from a
symmetric $\alpha$-stable ($S\alpha S$) distribution is derived. The proof
leverages two key components: a concentration inequality for empirical
fractional moments of $S\alpha S$ variables and a covering number bound for
sparse $\ell_\alpha$ balls. The resulting sample complexity reflects the
polynomial tail behavior of the concentration and reinforces an observation
made in the literature that the RIP framework may have to be replaced with
other sparse recovery formulations in practice, such as those based on the null
space property.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出两种方法，用于在混合模拟/数字接收器中通过矩阵铅笔法（MPM）估计到达方向（DoAs），解决了小样本下统计平均不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于混合模拟/数字接收器中模拟组合器对输出信号的纠缠效应，传统MPM方法无法直接应用，因此需要新的解决方案。

Method: 通过循环使用一组模拟组合器，覆盖整个空间，避免低维投影导致的信号衰减。第一种方法适用于全连接和部分连接的接收器，依赖周期性信号；第二种方法仅适用于部分连接的接收器，利用块对角结构消除对周期性信号的依赖。

Result: 数值模拟和与Cramér-Rao下限的比较验证了所提方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法成功解决了小样本下混合模拟/数字接收器中DoA估计的难题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to estimate the directions of arrival (DoAs) for
hybrid analog/digital (HAD) receivers when the number of snapshots is too small
for statistical averaging to be reliable. This goal is achieved in
fully-digital receivers by employing the matrix pencil method (MPM).
Unfortunately, the MPM cannot be directly applied in HAD receivers because of
the entanglement induced by the underlying analog combiners on the output
signals. Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a
low-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from
particular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two
approaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two
approaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by
cycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the
entire space. The first approach can be applied to both fully-connected (FC)
and partially-connected (PC) HADs and relies on the availability of periodic,
potentially unknown, signals to disentangle the output of the HAD receiver. The
second approach applies to PC-HADs only, and eliminates contingency on periodic
signals by exploiting the underlying block diagonal structure. The superiority
of the proposed approaches is demonstrated via numerical simulations and
comparisons with the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound.

Conclusion: 论文为LLMO框架奠定了理论基础，扩展了其在复杂场景中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Future wireless networks are expected to incorporate diverse services that
often lack general mathematical models. To address such black-box network
management tasks, the large language model (LLM) optimizer framework, which
leverages pretrained LLMs as optimization agents, has recently been promoted as
a promising solution. This framework utilizes natural language prompts
describing the given optimization problems along with past solutions generated
by LLMs themselves. As a result, LLMs can obtain efficient solutions
autonomously without knowing the mathematical models of the objective
functions. Although the viability of the LLM optimizer (LLMO) framework has
been studied in various black-box scenarios, it has so far been limited to
numerical simulations. For the first time, this paper establishes a theoretical
foundation for the LLMO framework. With careful investigations of LLM inference
steps, we can interpret the LLMO procedure as a finite-state Markov chain, and
prove the convergence of the framework. Our results are extended to a more
advanced multiple LLM architecture, where the impact of multiple LLMs is
rigorously verified in terms of the convergence rate. Comprehensive numerical
simulations validate our theoretical results and provide a deeper understanding
of the underlying mechanisms of the LLMO framework.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用RIS增强的ISAC框架，用于结构健康监测（SHM），通过动态调整RIS相位抑制多径干扰，并利用Fisher信息理论和贝叶斯推理模型实现毫米级形变检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ISAC在SHM中面临多径干扰和高精度传感的挑战，亟需一种新方法来提升测量精度。

Method: 通过动态调整RIS相位生成独特信号抑制干扰，并利用Fisher信息理论优化观测时间和节点选择，同时开发贝叶斯模型识别结构状态。

Result: 理论和数值分析表明，该方法可实现毫米级形变检测，满足SHM的高精度需求。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了ISAC在高精度SHM中的潜力，为未来应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of future
cellular systems, enabling applications such as intruder detection, monitoring,
and tracking using the same infrastructure. However, its potential for
structural health monitoring (SHM), which requires the detection of slow and
subtle structural changes, remains largely unexplored due to challenges such as
multipath interference and the need for ultra-high sensing precision. This
study introduces a novel theoretical framework for SHM via ISAC by leveraging
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as reference points in collaboration
with base stations and users. By dynamically adjusting RIS phases to generate
distinct radio signals that suppress background multipath interference,
measurement accuracy at these reference points is enhanced. We theoretically
analyze RIS-aided collaborative sensing in three-dimensional cellular networks
using Fisher information theory, demonstrating how increasing observation time,
incorporating additional receivers (even with self-positioning errors),
optimizing RIS phases, and refining collaborative node selection can reduce the
position error bound to meet SHM's stringent accuracy requirements.
Furthermore, we develop a Bayesian inference model to identify structural
states and validate damage detection probabilities. Both theoretical and
numerical analyses confirm ISAC's capability for millimeter-level deformation
detection, highlighting its potential for high-precision SHM applications.

Motivation: 车联网（IoV）中存在大量实时数据传输和处理的需求，动态无线信道条件对此提出了挑战。

Method: 提出语义通信框架，结合生成扩散模型进行信道估计，并利用大模型微调以适应新场景。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上验证了框架的性能和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了车联网数据传输的效率和服务质量。

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) transforms the transportation ecosystem
promising pervasive connectivity and data-driven approaches. Deep learning and
generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly
enhance the operation of applications within IoV by facilitating efficient
decision-making and predictive capabilities, including intelligent navigation,
vehicle safety monitoring, accident prevention, and intelligent traffic
management. Nevertheless, efficiently transmitting and processing the massive
volumes of data generated by the IoV in real-time remains a significant
challenge, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable wireless channel
conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a semantic
communication framework based on channel perception to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of data transmission. The semantic communication model extracts and
compresses the information to be transmitted. In addition, the wireless channel
is estimated by using a generative diffusion model, which is employed to
predict the dynamic channel states, thereby improving the quality of IoV
service. In dynamic scenarios, however, the channel estimation performance may
be degraded when substantially new scenarios take place, which will adversely
affect user experience. To mitigate this limitation, we employ a large model to
fine-tune the channel generation model to enhance its adaptability for varying
scenarios. The performance and reliability of the proposed framework are
evaluated on the two public datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference
Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits
a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers
exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and
tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a
range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are
extracted for every target. For a single target, the resulting bistatic delays
are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric
position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed
equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are
obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account
for time synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving
target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to
standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results
show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G
PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有协同感知方法对高通信带宽和模型访问的依赖问题，适应实际自动驾驶场景中的限制。

Method: 提出了一种基于共享3D边界框属性的晚期协同框架，无需直接访问检测模型。

Result: 位置误差降低5倍，尺度误差减少7.5倍，方向误差减半，同时保持100%的精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该框架为高效、可扩展的多智能体融合设定了新基准，有效应对实际协同感知挑战。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular
algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without
explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the
adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results
exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA
with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute
deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including
scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear
convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.

Abstract: Efficient chip-scale interconnects are essential for modern
microelectronic-photonic systems, supporting high bandwidth and low-latency
processing. Traditional wired links face high resistivity and latency, while
millimeter-wave wireless solutions suffer from bandwidth congestion and
interference. Terahertz (THz) plasmonic communication, based on surface plasmon
polaritons (SPPs), offers high data rates and broad bandwidth, and is
compatible with nanophotonic platforms. This work introduces a Binary
Field-Driven Meta-Routing Method supported by a semi-analytical framework that
models the tunable interaction between THz plasmonic phenomena and graphene's
electromagnetic properties. By modulating graphene's impedance, the method
enables dynamic coupling and routing of localized surface plasmon resonances
(LSPRs) across a meta-network, facilitating real-time beam steering in
chip-scale systems. Combining analytical conductivity models, coupled-mode
theory, and algorithmic control, the approach enables predictive configuration
of LSPR-based steering in reconfigurable graphene metasurfaces. Four meta-pixel
antenna configurations Y-MetaRouter, MetaSwitcher, Penta-MetaEmitter, and
CP-MetaCore are designed to support unidirectional radiation, bi-directional
steering, frequency-driven transitions, and circular polarization,
respectively. Chemical potential modulation creates reconfigurable LSPR
pathways and virtual SPP channels. A Coupled-Mode Theory for Field-Driven LSPR
Meta-Networks is proposed to model current distributions and predict far-field
characteristics. Results show strong agreement between theory and full-wave
simulations. A point-to-point meta-wireless link is analyzed, demonstrating
scalability for low-latency, high-performance THz communication in WiNoC and
chiplet applications. System-level metrics confirm feasibility for
space-constrained, high-speed interconnects.
