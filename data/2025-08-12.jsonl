Many currently deployed GNSS receivers\nlack the proper countermeasures to defend themselves against interference,\nprompting the need for alternative defenses. Satellites in Low Earth Orbit\n(LEO) provide an opportunity for GNSS interference detection, classification,\nand localization. The direct geolocation approach has been shown to be\nwell-suited for low SNR regimes and in cases limited to short captures --\nexactly what is expected for receivers in LEO. Direct geolocation is a\nsingle-step search over a geographical grid that enables estimation of the\ntransmitter location directly from correlating raw observed signals.

Zak-transform based orthogonal time\nfrequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to be robust to doubly\nselective channels.

However,\ncurrent joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in SemComs is not compatible with\nthe existing communication systems and cannot adapt to the variations of the\nsources or the channels, while separate source-channel coding (SSCC) is\nsuboptimal in the finite blocklength regime. To address these issues, we\npropose an adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) scheme for SemComs over\nparallel Gaussian channels, where the deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic\nsource coding and conventional digital channel coding are separately deployed\nand adaptively designed. To enable efficient adaptation between the source and\nchannel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as\nfunctions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic\nregression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E\ndistortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power\nallocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex\napproximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASCC\nscheme outperforms typical deep JSCC and SSCC schemes for both the single- and\nparallel-channel scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with practical\ndigital systems."}

This study introduces a scalable data-driven method\nusing powertrain dynamic feature sets and both traditional machine learning and\ndeep neural networks to estimate instantaneous and cumulative power consumption\nin internal combustion engine (ICE), electric vehicle (EV), and hybrid electric\nvehicle (HEV) platforms. ICE models achieved high instantaneous accuracy with\nmean absolute error and root mean squared error on the order of $10^{-3}$, and\ncumulative errors under 3%. Transformer and long short-term memory models\nperformed best for EVs and HEVs, with cumulative errors below 4.1% and 2.1%,\nrespectively.

Uncertainty analysis revealed greater variability in EV and HEV\ndatasets than ICE, due to complex power management, emphasizing the need for\nrobust models for advanced powertrains."}

Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for\nadapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject\nvariability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts\nand motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and\nresults in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space\nAlignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific\nrecentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to\nenhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised\nCommon Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and\nsequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the\ngeometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation.\nUsing leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements across subjects and conditions. The parallel fusion\napproach shows the greatest enhancement over its sequential counterpart, with\nrobust performance maintained across varying data conditions and electrode\nconfigurations.

While Convolutional Neural Networks\nexcel at local feature extraction but lack global context, Transformers provide\nglobal modeling at high computational costs. Recent Mamba architectures based\non state-space models offer compelling solutions through linear complexity and\nefficient long-range modeling. In this study, we introduce Mamba-FCS, a SCD\nframework built upon Visual State Space Model backbone incorporating, a Joint\nSpatio-Frequency Fusion block incorporating log-amplitude frequency domain\nfeatures to enhance edge clarity and suppress illumination artifacts, a\nChange-Guided Attention (CGA) module that explicitly links the naturally\nintertwined BCD and SCD tasks, and a Separated Kappa (SeK) loss tailored for\nclass-imbalanced performance optimization. Extensive evaluation on SECOND and\nLandsat-SCD datasets shows that Mamba-FCS achieves state-of-the-art metrics,\n88.62% Overall Accuracy, 65.78% F_scd, and 25.50% SeK on SECOND, 96.25% Overall\nAccuracy, 89.27% F_scd, and 60.26% SeK on Landsat-SCD. Ablation analyses\nconfirm distinct contributions of each novel component, with qualitative\nassessments highlighting significant improvements in SCD.
