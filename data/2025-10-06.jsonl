Unlike conventional single-stage VQ approaches, which require\nexponentially larger codebooks to achieve higher fidelity, the proposed\nframework decomposes the quantization process into multiple stages and\ndynamically activates both stages and individual VQ modules. This design\nenables fine-grained rate adaptation under varying bit constraints while\nmitigating computational complexity and the codebook collapse problem. To\noptimize performance, we formulate a module selection problem that minimizes\ntask loss subject to a rate constraint and solve it using an incremental\nallocation algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the framework by incorporating\nentropy coding to exploit non-uniform codeword distributions, further reducing\ncommunication overhead. Simulation results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate\nthat the proposed framework outperforms existing digital semantic communication\nmethods, achieving superior semantic fidelity with lower complexity while\nproviding flexible and fine-grained rate control."}

To simplify the testing procedure and improve system design\nfor O-RAN systems, it is important to identify the dependencies among various\nperformance measurements, which are inherently time-series and can be modeled\nas realizations of random processes. While information theory can be utilized\nas a principled foundation for mapping these dependencies, the robust\nestimation of such measures for random processes from real-world data remains\nchallenging.

The proposed quantile-based AMIF estimator is\napplied to O-RAN time-series testing data to identify dependencies among\nvarious performance measures so that we can focus on a set of ``core''\nperformance measures.

The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship\nbetween information theory and estimation theory, which links the\nlog-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to\nnoisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of\nsignals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of\nnoise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector\nfields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels.\nWe prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form\nexpression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian\nmetric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the\nMahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both\nlocally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM\ncan be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion\nmodels) and solving a one-dimensional integral.

A Correlation Analysis", "categories": ["cs.RO"], "comment": null, "summary": "Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the\nintegration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such\nsystems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be\nconsidered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,\nprovide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to\nreproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation\nmetrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks\nconsensus on a standard set of metrics.\n  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and\nhuman-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific\nquantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as\nstandardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results\nindicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation\nbehavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and\nnew metrics are necessary."}

The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms\nattached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal\nbar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the\nrobot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based\non a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for\nrepositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing\nthe concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is\nproposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide\nmechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy\naccumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two\nstrategies are validated and compared in simulations.

However, existing methods often struggle to\nmodel such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that\nmasks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,\nobtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for\nreal-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel\nframework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It\nadopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion\ntrajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on\nthese trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from\nusers while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.\nFurthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users\nto specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory\nthrough action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic\ntraining and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and\nobject categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation\nscenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior\nvisual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines."}

This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their\neffectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.\nWe enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied\nAgents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task\ncoordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we\nexamine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised\ncombinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend\nour research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless\ncollaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the\neffectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent\nperformance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the\nsystem running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In\naddition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for\niterative system development and demonstrations."}
