Compared to conventional IRSs with only DTEs, the\nunique DTE-STE integrated structure introduces new challenges in both channel\nestimation and beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the channel\nestimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel\nestimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated\nis decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent\nchannel. Leveraging it along with the inherent sparsity of DTE- and STE-based\nchannels and manifold optimization, we propose an efficient channel estimation\nscheme. To address the rank mismatch problem in the imperfect channel sparsity\ninformation, a robust rank selection rule is developed. For beamforming, we\npropose an offline algorithm to optimize the STE phase shifts for wide beam\ncoverage, and an online algorithm to optimize the BS precoder and the DTE phase\nshifts using the estimated HE-IRS channel.

Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and\nreliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents\nand increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this\ncontext is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the\nreliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter\nvariations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may\naffect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In\nthis work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel\nimbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean\nsquares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to\nestimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected\ntargets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior\nknowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in\ncombination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed\nmethod suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the\nnormal operation of the radar.
