Abstract: Improving human health and well-being requires an accurate and effective
understanding of an individual's physical and mental state throughout daily
life. To support this goal, we utilized smartphones, smartwatches, and sleep
sensors to collect data passively and continuously for 24 hours a day, with
minimal interference to participants' usual behavior, enabling us to gather
quantitative data on daily behaviors and sleep activities across multiple days.
Additionally, we gathered subjective self-reports of participants' fatigue,
stress, and sleep quality through surveys conducted immediately before and
after sleep. This comprehensive lifelog dataset is expected to provide a
foundational resource for exploring meaningful insights into human daily life
and lifestyle patterns, and a portion of the data has been anonymized and made
publicly available for further research. In this paper, we introduce the ETRI
Lifelog Dataset 2024, detailing its structure and presenting potential
applications, such as using machine learning models to predict sleep quality
and stress.

### [2] [Detection of Autonomic Dysreflexia in Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury Using Multimodal Wearable Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03715)
*Bertram Fuchs,Mehdi Ejtehadi,Ana Cisnal,Jürgen Pannek,Anke Scheel-Sailer,Robert Riener,Inge Eriks-Hoogland,Diego Paez-Granados*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 开发了一种非侵入式、可解释的机器学习框架，通过多模态可穿戴传感器检测自主神经反射异常，显著优于基线模型，为脊髓损伤患者提供实时监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主神经反射异常（AD）是脊髓损伤患者中一种潜在威胁生命的疾病，亟需非侵入式、准确的实时检测方法。

Method: 使用多模态可穿戴传感器数据，通过BorutaSHAP进行特征选择和解释，训练模态和设备特定的弱学习器，并通过堆叠集成元模型进行聚合。

Result: 基于HR和ECG的特征最具信息量，集成模型的宏F1为0.77±0.03，HR模态的AUC最高（0.93）。

Conclusion: 该框架为脊髓损伤患者提供了一种个性化、实时的非侵入式监测方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition
characterized by sudden, severe blood pressure (BP) spikes in individuals with
spinal cord injury (SCI). Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent
cardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either
invasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in
daily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning
framework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were
collected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies,
including electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance
(BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three
commercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized
cuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature
extraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values
for explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and
aggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was
stratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived
features were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing
rhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the
highest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming
baseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve
(AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature
features contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and
low specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well
with clinical AD events. These results represent an important step toward
personalized, real-time monitoring for individuals with SCI.

### [3] [Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03906)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在现有基于CP-OFDM的调制解调器中实现Zak-OTFS调制，以在高延迟/多普勒扩展场景中提升性能。

Method: 采用带有sinc滤波和矩形时间窗口的低复杂度前置编码和后置处理，将Zak-OTFS集成到CP-OFDM框架中。

Result: 成功实现了Zak-OTFS在CP-OFDM上的低复杂度调制和解调，并证明CP-OFDM是其特例。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够兼容现有网络基础设施，同时在高延迟/多普勒扩展场景中提升了性能。

Abstract: Zak-Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to
achieve significantly better performance compared to the standardized
Cyclic-Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM), in high
delay/Doppler spread scenarios envisaged in next generation communication
systems. Zak-OTFS carriers are quasi-periodic pulses in the delay-Doppler (DD)
domain, characterized by two parameters, (i) the pulse period along the delay
axis (``delay period") (Doppler period is related to the delay period), and
(ii) the pulse shaping filter. An important practical challenge is enabling
support for Zak-OTFS modulation in existing CP-OFDM based modems. In this paper
we show that Zak-OTFS modulation with pulse shaping constrained to sinc
filtering (filter bandwidth equal to the communication bandwidth $B$) followed
by time-windowing with a rectangular window of duration $(T + T_{cp})$ ($T$ is
the symbol duration and $T_{cp}$ is the CP duration), can be implemented as a
low-complexity precoder over standard CP-OFDM. We also show that the Zak-OTFS
de-modulator with matched filtering constrained to sinc filtering (filter
bandwidth $B$) followed by rectangular time windowing over duration $T$ can be
implemented as a low-complexity post-processing of the CP-OFDM de-modulator
output. This proposed ``Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM" architecture enables us to
harness the benefits of Zak-OTFS in existing network infrastructure. We also
show that the proposed Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM is a family of modulations, with
CP-OFDM being a special case when the delay period takes its minimum possible
value equal to the inverse bandwidth, i.e., Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM with minimum
delay period.

### [4] [Optimal Interference Exploitation Waveform Design with Relaxed Block-Level Power Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04046)
*Xiao Tong,Lei Lei,Ang Li,A. Lee Swindlehurst,Symeon Chatzinotas*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非线性波形优化框架，用于多用户MIMO系统中基于CI的波形设计，通过引入附加变量和最大化传输块内的最小CI指标，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性CI预编码方法（如SLP和BLP）因严格符号级功率限制或自由度不足而性能受限，需解决这些问题以提高系统性能。

Method: 提出非线性波形优化框架，利用函数和KKT条件导出闭式解，并将其转化为可处理的QP问题，开发了高效ADMM算法。

Result: 仿真表明，所提算法在高阶调制和大块长度下显著优于传统CI-SLP和CI-BLP方法。

Conclusion: 非线性优化框架和高效ADMM算法的结合有效克服了传统方法的局限性，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates constructive interference (CI)-based waveform design
for phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation symbols under
relaxed block-level power constraints in multi-user multiple-input
single-output (MU-MIMO) communication systems. Existing linear CI-based
precoding methods, including symbol-level precoding (SLP) and block-level
precoding (BLP), suffer from performance limitations due to strict symbol-level
power budgets or insufficient degrees of freedom over the block. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a nonlinear waveform optimization framework that
introduces additional optimization variables and maximizes the minimum CI
metric across the transmission block. The optimal waveform is derived in closed
form using the function and Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions, and the solution is
explicitly expressed with respect to the dual variables. Moreover, the original
problems are equivalently reformulated as tractable quadratic programming (QP)
problems. To efficiently solve the derived QP problems, we develop an improved
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm by integrating a
linear-time projection technique, which significantly enhances the
computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithms substantially outperform the conventional CI-SLP and CI-BLP
approaches, particularly under high-order modulations and large block lengths.

*Liu Xuanyu,Gao Shijian,Liu Boxun,Cheng Xiang,Yang Liuqing*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: WiFo-CF提出了一种新型无线基础模型，用于CSI反馈，通过自监督预训练和混合专家架构，支持异构系统配置，并在模拟和真实场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CSI反馈方案局限于固定系统配置，缺乏泛化性和灵活性。WiFo-CF旨在解决这一问题，支持多样化的配置需求。

Conclusion: WiFo-CF展现了优异的性能、可扩展性和部署潜力，为CSI反馈提供了统一的异构配置解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based channel state information (CSI) feedback schemes
demonstrate strong compression capabilities but are typically constrained to
fixed system configurations, limiting their generalization and flexibility. To
address this challenge, WiFo-CF, a novel wireless foundation model tailored for
CSI feedback, is proposed, uniquely accommodating heterogeneous configurations
such as varying channel dimensions, feedback rates, and data distributions
within a unified framework through its key innovations: (1) a multi-user,
multi-rate self-supervised pre-training strategy; and (2) a Mixture of Shared
and Routed Expert (S-R MoE) architecture. Supporting the large-scale
pre-training of WiFo-CF is the first heterogeneous channel feedback dataset,
whose diverse patterns enable the model to achieve superior performance on both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data across simulated and real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, the learned representations effectively facilitate
adaptation to downstream tasks such as CSI-based indoor localization,
validating WiFo-CF's scalability and deployment potential.

### [6] [DFT-s-OFDM with Chirp Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04075)
*Yujie Liu,Yong Liang Guan,David González G.,Halim Yanikomeroglu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型波形DFT-s-OFDM-CM，用于下一代无线通信，通过Q元星座符号和线性调频信号的起始频率传递信息，保持了低PAPR和频率多样性等优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高频谱效率并保持低误码率，同时利用线性调频信号的优势，提出了DFT-s-OFDM-CM。

Method: 通过将信息比特分配到Q元星座符号和线性调频信号的起始频率，结合DFT-s-OFDM技术，实现高效通信。

Result: 仿真结果表明，DFT-s-OFDM-CM在保持相似误码率的情况下提高了频谱效率，且在相同频谱效率下具有更低误码率。

Conclusion: DFT-s-OFDM-CM是一种高效的通信方案，适用于下一代无线通信系统。

Abstract: In this paper, a new waveform called discrete Fourier transform spread
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with chirp modulation
(DFT-s-OFDM-CM) is proposed for the next generation of wireless communications.
The information bits are conveyed by not only Q-ary constellation symbols but
also the starting frequency of chirp signal. It could maintain the benefits
provided by the chirped discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM), e.g., low peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR), full frequency diversity exploitation, etc. Simulation results confirm
that the proposed DFT-s-OFDM-CM could achieve higher spectral efficiency while
keeping the similar bit error rate (BER) to that of chirped DFT-s-OFDM. In
addition, when maintaining the same spectral efficiency, the proposed
DFT-s-OFDM-CM with the splitting of information bits into two streams enables
the use of lower-order constellation modulation and offers greater resilience
to noise, resulting in a lower BER than the chirped DFT-s-OFDM.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 介绍了Neuro-MoBRE框架，通过脑区域-时间嵌入和专家混合方法解决神经生理数据异构性问题，在多任务和零样本解码中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经生理解码方法局限于单任务和个体，难以应对数据异构性；需要设计更通用的解码框架。

Result: 在11名受试者的复杂任务中超越现有方法，零样本解码表现优异。

Conclusion: Neuro-MoBRE通过显式解决异构性，为神经生理解码提供了通用且高效的方案。

Abstract: Neurophysiological decoding, fundamental to advancing brain-computer
interface (BCI) technologies, has significantly benefited from recent advances
in deep learning. However, existing decoding approaches largely remain
constrained to single-task scenarios and individual subjects, limiting their
broader applicability and generalizability. Efforts towards creating
large-scale neurophysiological foundation models have shown promise, but
continue to struggle with significant challenges due to pervasive data
heterogeneity across subjects and decoding tasks. Simply increasing model
parameters and dataset size without explicitly addressing this heterogeneity
fails to replicate the scaling successes seen in natural language processing.
Here, we introduce the Neural Mixture of Brain Regional Experts (Neuro-MoBRE),
a general-purpose decoding framework explicitly designed to manage the
ubiquitous data heterogeneity in neurophysiological modeling. Neuro-MoBRE
incorporates a brain-regional-temporal embedding mechanism combined with a
mixture-of-experts approach, assigning neural signals from distinct brain
regions to specialized regional experts on a unified embedding basis, thus
explicitly resolving both structural and functional heterogeneity.
Additionally, our region-masked autoencoding pre-training strategy further
enhances representational consistency among subjects, complemented by a
task-disentangled information aggregation method tailored to effectively handle
task-specific neural variations. Evaluations conducted on intracranial
recordings from 11 subjects across five diverse tasks, including complex
language decoding and epileptic seizure diagnosis, demonstrate that Neuro-MoBRE
surpasses prior art and exhibits robust generalization for zero-shot decoding
on unseen subjects.

*Hossein Maleki,Carles Diaz-Vilor,Ali Pezeshki,Vahid Tarokh,Hamid Jafarkhani*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于双功能雷达通信系统的波束成形方法，旨在解决频谱拥塞问题。通过优化雷达或通信性能的不同场景，提出了非凸问题的确定性近似和松弛方法，并通过数值实验验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在双功能雷达通信系统中能有效平衡雷达与通信性能，为解决频谱拥塞问题提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: The integrated design of communication and sensing may offer a potential
solution to address spectrum congestion. In this work, we develop a beamforming
method for a dual-function radar-communication system, where the transmit
signal is used for both radar surveillance and communication with multiple
downlink users, despite imperfect channel state information (CSI). We focus on
two scenarios of interest: radar-centric and communication-centric. In the
radar-centric scenario, the primary goal is to optimize radar performance while
attaining acceptable communication performance. To this end, we minimize a
weighted sum of the mean-squared error in achieving a desired beampattern and a
mean-squared cross correlation of the radar returns from directions of interest
(DOI). We also seek to ensure that the probability of outage for the
communication users remains below a desired threshold. In the
communication-centric scenario, our main objective is to minimize the maximum
probability of outage among the communication users while keeping the
aforementioned radar metrics below a desired threshold. Both optimization
problems are stochastic and untractable. We first take advantage of central
limit theorem to obtain deterministic non-convex problems and then consider
relaxations of these problems in the form of semidefinite programs with rank-1
constraints. We provide numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness
of the proposed designs.

TL;DR: 提出了两种近场宽带定位的子空间拟合方法，分别基于MUSIC算法和Fresnel近似，用于联合估计距离和角度，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近场球形波传播导致距离和角度参数耦合，传统远场系统中分离估计的方法不再适用，需要新的联合估计方法。

Method: 1. 推导了多目标宽带系统的频域近场信号模型；2. 开发了基于子空间拟合的MUSIC方法；3. 提出Fresnel近似MUSIC算法以降低复杂度。

Result: 数值结果验证了两种方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效解决近场定位中距离和角度耦合的问题，且Fresnel近似算法降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Two subspace fitting approaches are proposed for wideband near-field
localization. Unlike in conventional far-field systems, where distance and
angle can be estimated separately, spherical wave propagation in near-field
systems couples these parameters. We therefore derive a frequency-domain
near-field signal model for multi-target wideband systems and develop a
subspace fitting-based MUSIC method that jointly estimates distance and angle.
To reduce complexity, a Fresnel approximation MUSIC algorithm is further
introduced to decouple the distance and angle parameters. Numerical results
verify the effectiveness of both proposed approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SICS的协议，通过无线控制信号传输来应对RIS与MC之间的高信号延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RIS与MC之间因信号延迟导致的信号过时问题，提升通信效率。

Method: 采用SICS协议，结合STAR模式与非正交多址接入（NOMA）技术，优化反射、传输系数及叠加系数。

Result: 结果表明SICS方法具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SICS协议能有效解决信号延迟问题，提升系统性能。

Abstract: Integration of RIS in radio access networks requires signaling between edge
units and the RIS microcontroller (MC). Unfortunately, in several practical
scenarios, the signaling latency is higher than the communication channel
coherence time, which causes outdated signaling at the RIS. To counterbalance
this, we introduce a simultaneous information and control signaling (SICS)
protocol that enables operation adaptation through wireless control signal
transmission. SICS assumes that the MC is equipped with a single antenna that
operates at the same frequency as the RIS. RIS operates in simultaneous
transmission and reflection (STAR) mode, and the source employs non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) to superposition the information signal to the control
signal. To maximize the achievable user data rate while ensuring the MC's
ability to decode the control signal, we formulate and solve the corresponding
optimization problem that returns RIS's reflection and transmission
coefficients as well as the superposition coefficients of the NOMA scheme. Our
results reveal the robustness of the SICS approach.

Conclusion: 两阶段全数字收发器方案能够有效降低复杂度并提升性能，适用于未来移动通信系统。

Abstract: This paper considers a millimeter-wave wideband point-to-point MIMO system
with fully digital transceivers at the base station and the user equipment
(UE), focusing on mobile UE scenarios. A main challenge when building a digital
UE combining is the large volume of baseband samples to handle. To mitigate
computational and hardware complexity, we propose a novel two-stage digital
combining scheme at the UE. The first stage reduces the $N_{\text{r}}$ received
signals to $N_{\text{c}}$ streams before baseband processing, leveraging
channel geometry for dimension reduction and updating at the beam coherence
time, which is longer than the channel coherence time of the small-scale
fading. By contrast, the second-stage combining is updated per fading
realization. We develop a pilot-based channel estimation framework for this
hardware setup based on maximum likelihoodestimation in both uplink and
downlink. Digital precoding and combining designs are proposed, and a spectral
efficiency expression that incorporates imperfect channel knowledge is derived.
The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms hybrid
beamforming, showcasing the attractiveness of using two-stage fully digital
transceivers in future systems.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在低信噪比和稀疏场景下优于现有技术，且计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: 该算法为ELAA系统提供了一种有效的信道估计解决方案，具有广泛的适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This work focuses on channel estimation in extremely large aperture array
(ELAA) systems, where near-field propagation and spatial non-stationarity
introduce complexities that hinder the effectiveness of traditional estimation
techniques. A physics-based hybrid channel model is developed, incorporating
non-binary visibility region (VR) masks to simulate diffraction-induced power
variations across the antenna array. To address the estimation challenges posed
by these channel conditions, a novel algorithm is proposed:
Visibility-Region-HMM-Aided Polar-Domain Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching
Pursuit (VR-HMM-P-SOMP). The method extends a greedy sparse recovery framework
by integrating VR estimation through a hidden Markov model (HMM), using a novel
emission formulation and Viterbi decoding. This allows the algorithm to
adaptively mask steering vectors and account for spatial non-stationarity at
the antenna level. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
enhances estimation accuracy compared to existing techniques, particularly in
low-SNR and sparse scenarios, while maintaining a low computational complexity.
The algorithm presents robustness across a range of design parameters and
channel conditions, offering a practical solution for ELAA systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Wasserstein距离的自适应混合分布方案（WS-DC），用于优化数字任务导向语义通信中的码本设计，提高频谱效率和信道容量利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务导向语义通信（ToSC）方法中，码本稀疏激活导致频谱效率低和信道容量未充分利用。如何设计既能支持任务特定推理又能接近信道容量理论极限的码本是一个关键挑战。

Method: 构建了一个频谱效率感知的码本设计框架，将码本激活概率纳入优化过程，并使用Wasserstein距离作为正则化指标以最小化激活分布与最优信道输入分布之间的差距。

Result: 实验结果表明，WS-DC在推理准确性和码本效率上均优于现有方法，为接近容量极限的语义通信系统提供了新方向。

Conclusion: WS-DC是一种高效的任务驱动和信道感知的潜在表示学习方法，显著提升了语义通信系统的性能。

Abstract: Digital task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC) aims to transmit only
task-relevant information, significantly reducing communication overhead.
Existing ToSC methods typically rely on learned codebooks to encode semantic
features and map them to constellation symbols. However, these codebooks are
often sparsely activated, resulting in low spectral efficiency and
underutilization of channel capacity. This highlights a key challenge: how to
design a codebook that not only supports task-specific inference but also
approaches the theoretical limits of channel capacity. To address this
challenge, we construct a spectral efficiency-aware codebook design framework
that explicitly incorporates the codebook activation probability into the
optimization process. Beyond maximizing task performance, we introduce the
Wasserstein (WS) distance as a regularization metric to minimize the gap
between the learned activation distribution and the optimal channel input
distribution. Furthermore, we reinterpret WS theory from a generative
perspective to align with the semantic nature of ToSC. Combining the above two
aspects, we propose a WS-based adaptive hybrid distribution scheme, termed
WS-DC, which learns compact, task-driven and channel-aware latent
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that WS-DC not only
outperforms existing approaches in inference accuracy but also significantly
improves codebook efficiency, offering a promising direction toward
capacity-approaching semantic communication systems.

Motivation: 填补非英语语言在脑-语言配对数据上的稀缺性，支持大脑活动与大型语言模型（LLM）语义对齐的研究。

Method: 扩展了之前的ChineseEEG数据集，增加了主动模态（朗读和被动听读），收集了10.7小时的朗读和21.6小时的听读EEG数据，并整合了音频和语义嵌入。

Conclusion: ChineseEEG-2为下一代神经语义解码提供了基准数据集，推动了中文语境下脑-LLM对齐的研究。

Abstract: EEG-based neural decoding requires large-scale benchmark datasets. Paired
brain-language data across speaking, listening, and reading modalities are
essential for aligning neural activity with the semantic representation of
large language models (LLMs). However, such datasets are rare, especially for
non-English languages. Here, we present ChineseEEG-2, a high-density EEG
dataset designed for benchmarking neural decoding models under real-world
language tasks. Building on our previous ChineseEEG dataset, which focused on
silent reading, ChineseEEG-2 adds two active modalities: Reading Aloud (RA) and
Passive Listening (PL), using the same Chinese corpus. EEG and audio were
simultaneously recorded from four participants during ~10.7 hours of reading
aloud. These recordings were then played to eight other participants,
collecting ~21.6 hours of EEG during listening. This setup enables speech

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于DD域信号处理的OFDM方案（DD-a-OFDM），通过结合DDMC研究见解，提升OFDM性能，适用于6G高移动性场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G系统中的高移动性场景需求日益重要，但现有的OFDM波形在严重多普勒扩展下存在子载波正交性损失问题，而OTFS虽能利用时频域信道多样性，但其接收复杂度高且资源分配不灵活。因此，需要一种改进方案。

Method: 设计了DD-a-OFDM系统结构，保留经典OFDM收发机的同时，引入DD域信道估计和时频域均衡；通过离散时频导频进行DD域信道估计，证明了时频域干扰可转为DD域高斯干扰；推导了CRLB，并开发了ML和峰值检测估计器及时频域均衡器。

Result: 数值结果表明，DD-a-OFDM相比经典OFDM降低了误码率，且在信道估计精度和导频开销方面优于OTFS。

Conclusion: DD-a-OFDM通过结合DD域信号处理，有效提升了OFDM在高移动性场景下的性能，是6G系统中一种有前景的波形方案。

Abstract: High-mobility scenarios will be a critical part of 6G systems. Since the
widely deployed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform
suffers from subcarrier orthogonality loss under severe Doppler spread,
delay-Doppler domain multi-carrier (DDMC) modulation systems, such as
orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), have been extensively studied. While
OTFS can exploit time-frequency (TF) domain channel diversity, it faces
challenges including high receiver complexity and inflexible TF resource
allocation, making OFDM still the most promising waveform for 6G. In this
article, we propose a DD domain signal processing-aided OFDM (DD-a-OFDM) scheme
to enhance OFDM performance based on DDMC research insights. First, we design a
DD-a-OFDM system structure, retaining the classical OFDM transceiver while
incorporating DD domain channel estimation and TF domain equalization. Second,
we detail DD domain channel estimation using discrete TF pilots and prove that
TF domain inter-carrier interference (ICI) could be transformed into DD domain
Gaussian interference. Third, we derive closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds
(CRLBs) for DD domain channel estimation. Fourth, we develop maximum likelihood
(ML) and peak detection-based channel estimators, along with a corresponding TF
domain equalizer. Numerical results verify the proposed design, showing that
DD-a-OFDM reduces the bit-error rate (BER) compared to classical OFDM and
outperforms OTFS in channel estimation accuracy with lower pilot overhead.

Motivation: 当前任务导向语义通信（ToSC）框架中，离散映射与通道特性及任务需求脱节，导致性能不佳，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出一种基于Wasserstein正则化目标的通道感知离散语义编码框架，优化语义符号选择。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种信噪比条件下显著提升了精度和通信效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来数字基础设施中语义通信的广泛应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Discrete representation has emerged as a powerful tool in task-oriented
semantic communication (ToSC), offering compact, interpretable, and efficient
representations well-suited for low-power edge intelligence scenarios. Its
inherent digital nature aligns seamlessly with hardware-friendly deployment and
robust storage/transmission protocols. However, despite its strengths, current
ToSC frameworks often decouple semantic-aware discrete mapping from the
underlying channel characteristics and task demands. This mismatch leads to
suboptimal communication performance, degraded task utility, and limited
generalization under variable wireless conditions. Moreover, conventional
designs frequently overlook channel-awareness in codebook construction,
restricting the effectiveness of semantic symbol selection under constrained
resources. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a channel-aware
discrete semantic coding framework tailored for low-power edge networks.
Leveraging a Wasserstein-regularized objective, our approach aligns discrete
code activations with optimal input distributions, thereby improving semantic
fidelity, robustness, and task accuracy. Extensive experiments on the inference
tasks across diverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes show that our method
achieves notable gains in accuracy and communication efficiency. This work
provides new insights into integrating discrete semantics and channel
optimization, paving the way for the widespread adoption of semantic
communication in future digital infrastructures.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于流体天线中继（FAR）的高能效无线通信系统，解决非视距（NLoS）链路问题，并通过优化天线位置和算法设计，显著提升了系统能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G通信的发展，流体天线系统（FAS）因其灵活性成为关键技术，但现有研究主要关注视距（LoS）场景，忽视了非视距（NLoS）链路问题。

Method: 设计了结合放大转发（AF）协议的FAR辅助通信系统，通过优化流体天线位置、功率控制和波束成形，建立了联合考虑阻挡矩阵和衰落的信道模型，并提出迭代算法解决能效最大化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提算法在能效方面优于传统方案，比RIS和AF中继方案分别高出23.39%和39.94%。

Conclusion: FAR系统通过优化天线位置和算法设计，有效解决了NLoS链路问题，显著提升了6G通信系统的能效。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an energy efficient wireless communication system
based on fluid antenna relay (FAR) to solve the problem of non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) links caused by blockages with considering the physical properties.
Driven by the demand for the sixth generation (6G) communication, fluid antenna
systems (FASs) have become a key technology due to their flexibility in
dynamically adjusting antenna positions. Existing research on FAS primarily
focuses on line-of-sight (LoS) communication scenarios, and neglects the
situations where only NLoS links exist. To address the issues posted by NLoS
communication, we design an FAR-assisted communication system combined with
amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. In order to alleviate the high energy
consumption introduced by AF protocol while ensuring communication quality, we
formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem. By optimizing the
positions of the fluid antennas (FAs) on both sides of the FAR, we achieve
controllable phase shifts of the signals transmitting through the blockage
which causes the NLoS link. Besides, we establish a channel model that jointly
considers the blockage-through matrix, large-scale fading, and small-scale
fading. To maximize the EE of the system, we jointly optimize the FAR position,
FA positions, power control, and beamforming design under given constraints,
and propose an iterative algorithm to solve this formulated optimization
problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the
traditional schemes in terms of EE, achieving up to $23.39\%$ and $39.94\%$
higher EE than the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) scheme
and traditional AF relay scheme, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对液晶技术的可重构智能表面(RIS)的设计方法，解决了其相位响应频率依赖性导致的性能下降问题，尤其适用于安全通信系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 液晶技术为RIS提供了一种低功耗、可扩展的实现方案，但其相位响应具有频率依赖性，可能导致性能下降和信息泄露。

Method: 设计了针对宽带OFDM系统的RIS，无需完整信道状态信息(CSI)获取和频繁重构，仅在特定区域增强信号，避免泄露给潜在窃听者。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法比忽略频率依赖性的方法提高了保密率，在60 GHz中心频率和8 GHz带宽下实现了约2 bits/symbol的保密率。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了液晶RIS的频率依赖性问题，提升了安全通信系统的性能。

Abstract: Liquid crystal (LC) technology provides a low-power and scalable approach to
implement a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). However, the LC-based
RIS's phase-shift response is inherently frequency-dependent, which can lead to
performance degradation if not properly addressed. This issue becomes
especially critical in secure communication systems, where such variations may
result in considerable information leakage. To avoid the need for full channel
state information (CSI) acquisition and frequent RIS reconfiguration, we design
RIS for a wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system to
illuminate a desired area containing legitimate users while avoiding leakage to
regions where potential eavesdroppers may be located. Our simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the secrecy rate compared to
methods that neglect frequency-dependent effects. In the considered setup, the
proposed method achieves a secrecy rate of about 2 bits/symbol over an 8 GHz
bandwidth when the center frequency is 60 GHz.

Motivation: 为未来的6G室内网络设计一种集成定位与通信的系统，以应对高精度定位和高效通信的需求，同时满足实际信道条件。

Method: 采用接收信号强度（RSS）和激进轴定理提升定位精度；使用空间调制（SM）和M-PAM技术实现高效通信；通过LS估计器联合估计信道和调光系数。

Result: 仿真结果显示亚厘米级别的定位精度，低阶PAM方案下误码率低于10^{-6}，LED布局几何中心附近性能显著提升。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint communication and indoor positioning (JCP) system
based on visible light communication (VLC) designed for high-precision indoor
environments. The framework supports 2D and 3D positioning using received
signal strength (RSS) from pilot transmissions, enhanced by the radical axis
theorem to improve accuracy under measurement uncertainties. Communication is
achieved using spatial modulation (SM) with M-ary pulse amplitude modulation
(PAM), where data is conveyed through the modulation symbol and the active
light-emitting diode (LED) index, improving spectral efficiency while
maintaining low complexity. A pilot-aided least squares (LS) estimator is
employed for joint channel and dimming coefficient estimation, enabling robust
symbol detection in multipath environments characterized by both line-of-sight
(LOS) and diffuse non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components, modeled using Rician
fading. The proposed system incorporates a dimming control mechanism to meet
lighting requirements while maintaining reliable communication and positioning
performance. Simulation results demonstrate sub-centimeter localization
accuracy at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and bit error rates (BERs) below
10^{-6} for low-order PAM schemes. Additionally, comparative analysis across
user locations reveals that positioning and communication performance improve
significantly near the geometric center of the LED layout. These findings
validate the effectiveness of the proposed system for future 6G indoor networks
requiring integrated localization and communication under practical channel
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在MC系统中，发射器的存储容量有限，限制了可用于传输的分子数量，从而影响了通信的可靠性。因此，需要在传输分子数量和BER性能之间找到平衡。

Method: 论文首先分析了传输分子数量与BER的关系，并引入了一种综合考虑两者权重的平衡函数。通过归一化处理，使用梯度下降算法确定最优传输分子数量。

Result: 理论和仿真结果表明，该优化方法能够实现传输分子数量与BER性能之间的理想平衡。

Conclusion: 通过所提出的方法，论文成功地在MC系统中实现了传输分子数量与BER性能的最优平衡。

Abstract: In the domain of molecular communication (MC), information is conveyed
through the characteristics of molecules transmitted between the transmitter
and the receiver bionanosensors via propagation. The constrained size of the
transmitter imposes limitations on its storage capacity, constraining the
number of available molecules for transmission, with a resulting effect on
communication reliability. This paper primarily focuses on achieving an
equilibrium between the number of transmitted molecules and the bit error rate
(BER) performance. To this end, we first analyze the relationship between the
number of transmitted molecules and the BER performance. Subsequently, a
balancing function that considers both the number of transmitted molecules and
the BER performance is introduced, taking into account the molecules'
respective weights. Given the difference in magnitude between the number of
transmitted molecules and the BER, these parameters are normalized to
facilitate analysis. Subsequently, a Gradient Descent Algorithm is employed to
determine the optimal number of transmitted molecules, aiming to achieve the
optimal equilibrium in the analyzed MC system. Theoretical and simulation
results are provided, substantiating that the optimal outcome indeed
establishes an ideal balance between the number of transmitted molecules and
the BER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中的ISAC技术面临近场效应和硬件成本高的问题，混合架构设计能同时提升硬件和能源效率，因此研究其在近场ISAC中的应用具有重要意义。

Method: 首先推导了点目标的联合角度-距离估计的CRB和扩展目标的BCRB，随后通过优化发射波束聚焦最小化CRB/BCRB，并提出基于惩罚的连续凸近似和交替优化算法设计混合波束形成器。

Result: 仿真结果表明近场区域内的联合距离-角度估计是可行的，但混合架构会降低距离估计精度；系统能效提升会牺牲目标估计精度，揭示了其间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 研究为6G网络中的ISAC系统提供了能量高效的混合波束聚焦设计方法，但其性能与完全数字架构相比存在一定差距，未来可能需进一步优化。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a pivotal component of
sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, leveraging high-frequency bands and
massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) to deliver both high-capacity
communication and high-precision sensing. However, these technological
advancements lead to significant near-field effects, while the implementation
of M-MIMO \mbox{is associated with considerable} hardware costs and escalated
power consumption. In this context, hybrid architecture designs emerge as both
hardware-efficient and energy-efficient solutions. Motivated by these
considerations, we investigate the design of energy-efficient hybrid
beamfocusing for near-field ISAC under two distinct target scenarios, i.e., a
point target and an extended target. Specifically, we first derive the
closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) of joint angle-and-distance estimation
for the point target and the Bayesian CRB (BCRB) of the target response matrix
for the extended target. Building on these derived results, we minimize the
CRB/BCRB by optimizing the transmit beamfocusing, while ensuring the energy
efficiency (EE) of the system and the quality-of-service (QoS) for
communication users. To address the resulting \mbox{nonconvex problems}, we
first utilize a penalty-based successive convex approximation technique with a
fully-digital beamformer to obtain a suboptimal solution. Then, we propose an
efficient alternating \mbox{optimization} algorithm to design the
analog-and-digital beamformer. \mbox{Simulation} results indicate that joint
distance-and-angle estimation is feasible in the near-field region. However,
the adopted hybrid architectures inevitably degrade the accuracy of distance
estimation, compared with their fully-digital counterparts. Furthermore,
enhancements in system EE would compromise the accuracy of target estimation,
unveiling a nontrivial tradeoff.

Abstract: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum
allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in
modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts,
particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to
establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and
meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming
6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective
spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key
performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast
spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy
and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature
engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning
techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by
arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular,
data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum
utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark,
underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable
predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology,
highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory
bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.

Result: 实验表明该方法在真实城市道路环境中提升了行人检测的准确性和时效性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了动态NLoS盲区的行人检测问题，提升了道路安全性。

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are
available at https://hiyeun.github.io/NLoS/.

Result: 在步态识别任务中准确率达96.94%，仅微调0.322%参数，超越传统方法0.61%，训练时间减少45%。

Conclusion: MAEPD为DAS领域信号识别提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

Result: 该方法能够可靠地去除相位奇异点，并在小自动校准区域（7×7）下高效估算无奇异点的线圈灵敏度。

Conclusion: NLINV是一种高效可靠的工具，适用于MRI图像重建和线圈灵敏度估算。

Abstract: Purpose: Phase singularities are a common problem in image reconstruction
with auto-calibrated sensitivities due to an inherent ambiguity of the
estimation problem. The purpose of this work is to develop a method for
detecting and correcting phase poles in non-linear inverse (NLINV)
reconstruction of MR images and coil sensitivity maps. Methods: Phase poles are
detected in individual coil sensitivity maps by computing the curl in each
pixel. A weighted average of the curl in each coil is computed to detect phase
poles. Phase pole detection and correction is then integrated into the
iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method of the NLINV algorithm, which then
avoid phase singularities in the reconstructed images. The method is evaluated
for reconstruction of accelerated Cartesian MPRAGE data of the brain and
interactive radial real-time MRI of the human heart. Results: Phase poles are
reliably removed in NLINV reconstructions for both applications. NLINV with
phase pole correction can reliably and efficiently estimate coil sensitivity
profiles free from singularities even from very small ($7\times7$)
auto-calibration (AC) regions. Conclusion: NLINV emerges as an efficient and
reliable tool for image reconstruction and coil sensitivity estimation in
challenging MRI applications.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions aerial corridors for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) to reduce ground traffic congestion by supporting 3D mobility,
such as air taxis. A key challenge in these high-mobility aerial corridors is
ensuring reliable connectivity, where frequent handovers can degrade network
performance. To resolve this, we present a Context-Aware Smart Handover (CASH)
protocol that uses a forward-looking scoring mechanism based on UAV trajectory
to make proactive handover decisions. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed CASH against existing handover protocols in a custom-built simulator.
Results show that CASH reduces handover frequency by up to 78% while
maintaining low outage probability. We then investigate the impact of base
station density and safety margin on handover performance, where their optimal
setups are empirically obtained to ensure reliable UAM communication.

Abstract: Evaluating cellular systems, from 5G New Radio (NR) and 5G-Advanced to 6G, is
challenging because the performance emerges from the tight coupling of
propagation, beam management, scheduling, and higher-layer interactions.
System-level simulation is therefore indispensable, yet the vast majority of
studies rely on the statistical 3GPP channel models. These are well suited to
capture average behavior across many statistical realizations, but cannot
reproduce site-specific phenomena such as corner diffraction, street-canyon
blockage, or deterministic line-of-sight conditions and
angle-of-departure/arrival relationships that drive directional links. This
paper extends 5G-LENA, an NR module for the system-level Network Simulator 3
(ns-3), with a trace-based channel model that processes the Multipath
Components (MPCs) obtained from external ray-tracers (e.g., Sionna Ray Tracer
(RT)) or measurement campaigns. Our module constructs frequency-domain channel
matrices and feeds them to the existing Physical (PHY)/Medium Access Control
(MAC) stack without any further modifications. The result is a geometry-based
channel model that remains fully compatible with the standard 3GPP
implementation in 5G-LENA, while delivering site-specific geometric fidelity.
This new module provides a key building block toward Digital Twin (DT)
capabilities by offering realistic site-specific channel modeling, unlocking
studies that require site awareness, including beam management, blockage
mitigation, and environment-aware sensing. We demonstrate its capabilities for
precise beam-steering validation and end-to-end metric analysis. In both cases,
the trace-driven engine exposes performance inflections that the statistical
model does not exhibit, confirming its value for high-fidelity system-level
cellular networks research and as a step toward DT applications.
