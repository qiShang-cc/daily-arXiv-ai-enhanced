### [1] [When Every Symbol Counts: Resilient Wireless Systems Under Finite Blocklength Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21664)
*Kevin Weinberger,Aydin Sezgin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 6G无线网络在动态环境中需要高韧性，但有限块长（FBL）约束会降低通信效率。通过可重构智能表面（RIS）增强适应性，研究发现两个关键块长阈值，RIS元素数量可调整这些阈值，提升韧性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络对关键操作至关重要，但FBL约束下的快速恢复可能导致通信效率下降。研究如何在FBL条件下优化恢复策略，提升韧性。

Method: 结合RIS技术，研究FBL约束对恢复性能的影响，通过数值分析确定关键块长阈值和RIS元素的作用。

Result: 发现两个关键块长阈值：一个可完全抵消FBL损失，另一个还能恢复初始中断。RIS元素数量可调整阈值，缩短块长需求。

Conclusion: RIS技术能有效缓解FBL约束下的性能损失，提升6G网络的韧性。研究结果为FBL条件下的速率、块长和重构权衡提供了新见解。

Abstract: As 6G evolves, wireless networks become essential for critical operations and
enable innovative applications that demand seamless adaptation to dynamic
environments and disruptions. Because these vital services require
uninterrupted operation, their resilience to unforeseen disruptions is
essential. However, implementing resilience necessitates rapid recovery
procedures, which operate in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, where short
packets and added error-correction overhead can severely degrade communication
efficiency. Due to this performance loss, always attempting recovery can
backfire and result in worse outcomes than simply enduring the disruption under
longer blocklengths. In this work, we study these effects of FBL constraints
within a resilience framework, incorporating reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) to enhance adaptation capabilities. By actively shaping the
wireless environment, RIS help counteract some of the performance losses caused
by FBL, enabling more effective recovery from disruptions. Numerical results
reveal two critical blocklength thresholds: the first enables full recovery
from the FBL penalty, while the second, at a higher blocklength, allows the
system to recover from both the FBL penalty and the initial disruption,
yielding a significant improvement in resilience performance. Additionally, we
show that the number of RIS elements shifts these thresholds, enabling faster
reconfiguration with shorter blocklengths and providing insights to the
trade-offs between rate, blocklength, and reconfiguration effort under FBL
conditions.

### [2] [Joint RIS-UE Association and Beamforming Design in RIS-Assisted Cell-Free MIMO Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21690)
*Hongqin Ke,Jindan Xu,Wei Xu,Chau Yuen,Zhaohua Lu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在RIS辅助的CF MIMO网络中，通过RIS-UE关联减少信道获取开销的方法，并设计了一个两阶段的联合优化框架，显著提高了系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RIS辅助的CF MIMO网络虽然能提升性能，但多个RIS元素的部署会导致较高的信道获取开销，尤其在节点和天线密度高时更为显著。因此，研究如何通过RIS-UE关联降低开销成为一个重要问题。

Method: 论文采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用多对多匹配算法建立RIS-UE关联；第二阶段通过顺序优化方法分别解决RIS相位和AP波束成形的联合优化问题，其中RIS优化采用MM算法，AP优化采用联合块对角化算法。

Result: 仿真结果显示，所提算法在显著减少开销的同时，仅带来可接受的性能损失。此外，研究表明RIS部署在AP和UE之间时性能更优。

Conclusion: 通过RIS-UE关联和两阶段优化方法，本文有效解决了RIS辅助CF网络中的开销问题，同时保持了系统性能，为未来RIS部署提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted cell-free (CF)
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks can significantly enhance system
performance. However, the extensive deployment of RIS elements imposes
considerable channel acquisition overhead, with the high density of nodes and
antennas in RIS-assisted CF networks amplifying this challenge. To tackle this
issue, in this paper, we explore integrating RIS-user equipment (UE)
association into downlink RIS-assisted CF transmitter design, which greatly
reduces the channel acquisition costs. The key point is that once UEs are
associated with specific RISs, there is no need to frequently acquire channels
from non-associated RISs. Then, we formulate the problem of joint RIS-UE
association and beamforming at APs and RISs to maximize the weighted sum rate
(WSR). In particular, we propose a two-stage framework to solve it. In the
first stage, we apply a many-to-many matching algorithm to establish the RIS-UE
association. In the second stage, we introduce a sequential optimization-based
method that decomposes the joint optimization of RIS phase shifts and AP
beamforming into two distinct subproblems. To optimize the RIS phase shifts, we
employ the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to obtain a
semi-closed-form solution. For AP beamforming, we develop a joint block
diagonalization algorithm, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that,
while RIS-UE association significantly reduces overhead, it incurs a minor
performance loss that remains within an acceptable range. Additionally, we
investigate the impact of RIS deployment and conclude that RISs exhibit
enhanced performance when positioned between APs and UEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在雷达目标检测中表现优异，但其高计算复杂度限制了在嵌入式雷达系统中的广泛应用。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛树搜索的神经架构搜索方法，优化网络结构以满足检测性能同时降低计算复杂度。

Result: 提出的新网络在检测概率满足要求的同时，显著降低了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法为雷达系统中的高效神经网络设计提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent research works establish deep neural networks as high performing tools
for radar target detection, especially on challenging environments (presence of
clutter or interferences, multi-target scenarii...). However, the usually large
computational complexity of these networks is one of the factors preventing
them from being widely implemented in embedded radar systems. We propose to
investigate novel neural architecture search (NAS) methods, based on
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), for finding neural networks achieving the
required detection performance and striving towards a lower computational
complexity. We evaluate the searched architectures on endoclutter radar
signals, in order to compare their respective performance metrics and
generalization properties. A novel network satisfying the required detection
probability while being significantly lighter than the expert-designed baseline
is proposed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该方法为6G网络中ML-based信道反馈的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network-based compression and decompression of channel state feedback
has been one of the most widely studied applications of machine learning (ML)
in wireless networks. Various simulation-based studies have shown that ML-based
feedback compression can result in reduced overhead and more accurate channel
information. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no real-life
proofs of concepts demonstrating the benefits of ML-based channel feedback
compression in a practical setting, where the user equipment (UE) and base
station have no access to each others' ML models. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for training interoperable compression and decompression ML
models in a confidential manner, and demonstrate the accuracy of the ensuing
models using prototype UEs and base stations. The performance of the ML-based
channel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed
channel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the
channel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results
demonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel
feedback link without having to share ML models between device and network
vendors. These results pave the way for a practical implementation of ML-based
channel feedback in commercial 6G networks.

### [5] [Adaptive Multipath-Based SLAM for Distributed MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21798)
*Xuhong Li,Benjamin J. B. Deutschmann,Erik Leitinger,Florian Meyer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于分布式MIMO系统的贝叶斯MP-SLAM方法，通过振幅统计和软射线追踪策略解决了非凸几何环境中的路径信息融合问题，实验验证了其精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MP-SLAM方法假设地图特征与传播路径统计独立，忽视了非凸几何环境中的路径依赖性，亟需改进。

Method: 利用振幅统计建立自适应时变检测概率，提出软射线追踪策略，结合SPA算法进行贝叶斯估计，改进提议PDF以检测新表面。

Result: 在非凸几何场景中，方法能准确估计定位和地图，达到后验CRLB。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了路径信息融合问题，适用于复杂几何环境。

Abstract: Localizing users and mapping the environment using radio signals is a key
task in emerging applications such as reliable communications, location-aware
security, and safety critical navigation. Recently introduced multipath-based
simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) can jointly localize a mobile
agent and the reflective surfaces in radio frequency (RF) environments. Most
existing MP-SLAM methods assume that map features and their corresponding RF
propagation paths are statistically independent, which neglects inherent
dependencies arising when a single reflective surface contributes to different
propagation paths or when an agent communicates with more than one base
station. Previous approaches that aim to fuse information across propagation
paths are limited by their inability to perform ray tracing in environments
with nonconvex geometries. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian MP-SLAM method
for distributed MIMO systems that addresses this limitation. In particular, we
use amplitude statistics to establish adaptive time-varying detection
probabilities. Based on the resulting "soft" ray-tracing strategy, our method
can fuse information across propagation paths in RF environments with nonconvex
geometries. A Bayesian estimation method for the joint estimation of map
features and agent position is established by applying the message passing
rules of the sum-product algorithm (SPA) to the factor graph that represents
the proposed statistical model. We also introduce an improved proposal PDF for
particle-based computation of SPA messages. This proposal PDF enables the early
detection of new surfaces that are solely supported by double-bounce paths. Our
method is validated using synthetic RF measurements in a challenging scenario
with nonconvex geometries. The results demonstrate that it can provide accurate
localization and mapping estimates as well as attain the posterior CRLB.

### [6] [From Token to Rhythm: A Multi-Scale Approach for ECG-Language Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21803)
*Fuying Wang,Jiacheng Xu,Lequan Yu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的多尺度心电图-语言预训练模型MELP，通过分层次的跨模态监督，解决了现有方法无法捕捉心电图信号多尺度特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习心电图分析依赖大量人工标注数据，资源消耗大。自监督学习虽能减少标注依赖，但现有方法未能充分捕捉心电图的多尺度特性，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: MELP模型首先预训练一个心脏病学专用语言模型，然后通过令牌、心跳和心律三个层次的对齐监督，将心电图信号与文本报告进行跨模态对齐。

Result: 在三个公共心电图数据集上的实验表明，MELP在零样本分类、线性探测和迁移学习任务中均优于现有自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: MELP通过多尺度监督学习显著提升了心电图表示的泛化能力和适应性，展现了在多样化临床任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in monitoring cardiac health and
diagnosing heart diseases. However, traditional deep learning approaches for
ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both
time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation,
self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling
the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently
transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored
SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail
to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods
struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model
the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP,
a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages
hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a
cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical
text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token,
beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing
structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three
public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG
classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its
effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications. Our code
is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/MELP.

### [7] [Improving Convergence for Semi-Federated Learning: An Energy-Efficient Approach by Manipulating Over-the-Air Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21893)
*Jingheng Zheng,Hui Tian,Wanli Ni,Yang Tian,Ping Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合联邦学习和分割学习的混合框架SemiFL，通过利用空中计算进行梯度聚合，并通过调控学习率来优化收敛性能和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决联邦学习和分割学习在收敛性和能耗方面的问题，结合两者优势，提出了SemiFL框架，并利用空中计算优化学习率。

Method: 通过控制空中失真来调整学习率：在不稳定区域放大失真以加速收敛，而在稳定区域抑制噪声以保持小学习率，同时提出资源分配算法。

Result: 理论分析和仿真表明，SemiFL在不同数据分布下能显著提升收敛性能，同时降低能耗。

Conclusion: SemiFL通过动态调整学习率和资源分配，有效优化了学习框架的性能和能耗。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid learning framework that combines federated
and split learning, termed semi-federated learning (SemiFL), in which
over-the-air computation is utilized for gradient aggregation. A key idea is to
strategically adjust the learning rate by manipulating over-the-air distortion
for improving SemiFL's convergence. Specifically, we intentionally amplify
amplitude distortion to increase the learning rate in the non-stable region,
thereby accelerating convergence and reducing communication energy consumption.
In the stable region, we suppress noise perturbation to maintain a small
learning rate for improving SemiFL's final convergence. Theoretical results
demonstrate the antagonistic effects of over-the-air distortion in different
regions, under both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and
non-i.i.d. data settings. Then, we formulate two energy consumption
minimization problems, one for each region, which implements a two-region mean
square error threshold configuration scheme. Accordingly, we propose two
resource allocation algorithms with closed-form solutions. Simulation results
show that under different network and data distribution conditions,
strategically manipulating over-the-air distortion can efficiently adjust the
learning rate to improve SemiFL's convergence. Moreover, energy consumption can
be reduced by using the proposed algorithms.

*Osmel Martínez Rosabal,Onel Alcaraz López,Marco Di Renzo,Richard Demo Souza,Hirley Alves*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于半定规划引导粒子群优化（SgPSO）算法的可移动天线（MAs）配置方法，以最小化无线能量传输中的功耗，并展示了其在多设备场景中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可移动天线技术为6G及未来的无线系统提供了新的机会，特别是在无线能量传输中，动态调整天线位置能显著提高效率和扩展性。本文旨在通过优化MAs配置，降低功耗并满足设备的最低接收功率需求。

Method: 提出SgPSO算法，将每个天线配置表示为粒子，优化功率分配。针对非线性非凸问题，采用半定规划引导的粒子群优化方法，并与固定天线阵列和均匀间隔MAs进行比较。

Result: SgPSO在多天线或多设备场景中表现优异，性能远超固定阵列。均匀间隔MAs的表现接近独立控制MAs，但随着设备数量增加，差距逐渐扩大。天线数量的增加会促进近场条件，但设备分布越广，近场效应减弱。

Conclusion: SgPSO算法在优化MAs配置中表现出色，尤其在复杂场景中更具优势。均匀间隔MAs是独立控制MAs的有效替代方案，但在设备增加时性能差距明显。

Abstract: Recent advancements in movable antennas (MAs) technology create new
opportunities for 6G and beyond wireless systems. MAs are promising for radio
frequency wireless energy transfer because they can dynamically adjust antenna
positions, improving energy efficiency and scalability. This work aims to
minimize the power consumed by an analog beamforming power beacon equipped with
independently-controlled MAs (IMAs) for charging multiple single-antenna
devices. To this end, we enforce a minimum separation among antennas and a
minimum received power at the devices. The resulting optimization problem is
nonlinear and nonconvex due to interdependencies among the variables. To tackle
this, we propose a semidefinite program guided particle swarm optimization
(SgPSO) algorithm where each particle represents an antenna configuration, and
the fitness function optimizes the corresponding power allocation. SgPSO is
utilized for configuring the MAs largely outperforming fixed array
implementations, particularly with more antennas or devices. We also present an
alternative implementation using uniformly-spaced MAs, whose performance
closely approaches that of the IMAs, with the gap widening only as the number
of devices grows. We also examine how increasing the number of antennas
promotes near-field conditions, which decrease as devices become more widely
distributed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型混合神经网络接收器（H-NR），基于Transformer编码器和图神经网络（GNN），替代传统物理层模块，用于车联网上行链路通信场景，并在多种测试条件下表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏能够全面替代无线接收机物理层功能的神经网络模型，因此设计了H-NR以优化接收器的多项功能。

Method: 采用Transformer编码器和GNN构建H-NR，覆盖OFDM资源网格解映射、信道估计、信号均衡、解调和解码，并在车联网场景中测试其性能。

Abstract: Neural receiver models are proposed to jointly optimize multiple
functionalities of wireless receivers; however, a comprehensive receiver model
that replaces the entire physical layer blocks has not yet been presented in
the literature. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid neural receiver
(H-NR) built on Transformer encoder blocks and Graph Neural Network (GNN), as
part of an end-to-end wireless communication framework. In our communication
framework, we assume vehicle to network (V2N) uplink scenario where information
is transmitted by vehicle and received at the base station (BS). Our proposed
H-NR model replace OFDM resource grid demapping, channel estimation, signal
equalization, demodulation, and channel decoding. To test the adaptability of
our proposed model on unseen conditions, we evaluate its performance for
various scenarios, including a vehicle speed of range [0-60] km/h, a carrier
frequency of 5.9GHz, and a cluster delay line (CDL) channel model. Furthermore,
we assess the performance of our proposed H-NR on multimodal data, such as
images, audio, GPS, radar, and LiDAR, to examine its adaptability in real-world
use cases. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that our proposed model
outperforms the state-of-the-art neural receiver by approximately 0.5 dB in
terms of reconstruction and error correction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型调制方案HCM，用于解决RIS增强MU-MISO系统中SLP的挑战，并通过两阶段优化方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SLP在RIS增强MU-MISO系统中的可扩展性和QAM调制在CI利用上的局限性问题。

Method: 提出HCM调制方案和两阶段反射与SLP优化方法。

Result: HCM在调制阶数为16和64时分别比QAM有1.5 dB和1 dB的SER增益。

Conclusion: HCM和两阶段优化方法能有效提升系统性能，具有较好的可扩展性。

Abstract: The application of symbol-level precoding (SLP) in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) enhanced multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO)
systems faces two main challenges. First, the state-of-the-art joint reflecting
and SLP optimization approach requires exhaustive enumeration of all possible
transmit symbol combinations, resulting in scalability issues as the modulation
order and number of users increase. Second, conventional quadrature amplitude
modulation (QAM) exhibits strict constructive interference (CI) regions,
limiting its effectiveness for CI exploitation in SLP. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel modulation scheme, termed
hybrid-constellation modulation (HCM), which has a structure of superposed QAM
and ASK sub-constellations (SCs). HCM extends the CI regions compared to QAM.
Additionally, a two-stage reflecting and SLP optimization method is developed
to support HCM. The proposed methods are designed for practical RIS with
discrete phase shifts and has good scalability. Simulation results show that
HCM achieves up to 1.5 dB and 1 dB SER gains over QAM with modulation order 16
and 64, respectively.

Abstract: Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks aim to support innovative
Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications that demand faster and more secure data
transmission. While higher Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers employ
measures like encryption and secure protocols to address data security,
Physical-Layer Security (PLS) focuses on preventing information leakage to
EavesDroppers (EDs) and mitigating the effects of jammers and spoofing attacks.
In this context, the emerging technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
(RISs) can play an instrumental role, enhancing PLS by intelligently reflecting
electromagnetic waves to benefit Legitimate Users (LUs) while obstructing EDs.
This paper presents practical indoor measurements to evaluate the capability of
an RIS to enhance PLS, focusing on a varactor-based RIS technology designed for
the FR1 band at 3.55 GHz. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art RIS-aided
secrecy optimization algorithms together with a novel approach designed in this
paper, which relies on a newly generated RIS phase configuration codebook,
highlight the potential of RISs to improve both data rates for LUs as well as
secrecy against EDs in real-world indoor multipath environments. The results
also demonstrate the frequency selectivity of the RIS, proviging practical
insights on the optimization of the technology.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决分布式系统中相位同步的问题，特别是在移动性和硬件损伤的情况下，以实现相干信号叠加，支持相干空中计算（OAC）、分布式波束成形和干扰对齐等应用。

Method: 引入了相位编码导频（PCPs）策略，通过消除上下行链路的往返相位变化来对齐接收符号的相位；研究了在多用户场景下，载波频率偏移（CFO）对相位一致性的影响。

Result: 研究表明，残余CFO是决定相位一致性持续时间的主要因素，移动性和网络节点数量也有不可忽视的影响。通过现成无线电设备验证了PCPs的实际可行性。

Conclusion: PCPs在移动性和硬件损伤条件下仍能有效实现相位同步，为相干信号叠加提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we analyze the feasibility of distributed phase
synchronization for coherent signal superposition, a fundamental enabler for
paradigms such as coherent over-the-air computation (OAC), distributed
beamforming, and interference alignment, under mobility and hardware
impairments. With the focus on coherent OAC, we introduce phase-coded pilots
(PCPs), a strategy where the radios communicate with each other to eliminate
the round-trip phase change in the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) to align the
phase of the received symbol at a desired angle. In this study, considering a
carrier frequency offset (CFO)-resilient multi-user procedure, we derive the
statistics of the phase deviations to assess how fast the phase coherency
degrades. Our results show that residual CFO is a major factor determining the
duration of phase coherency, in addition to the non-negligible effects of
mobility and the number of nodes in the network. We also provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration for coherent signal superposition by using
off-the-shelf radios to demonstrate the feasibility of PCPs in practice.

Abstract: Robust regression models in the presence of outliers have significant
practical relevance in areas such as signal processing, financial econometrics,
and energy management. Many existing robust regression methods, either grounded
in statistical theory or sparse signal recovery, typically rely on the explicit
or implicit assumption of outlier sparsity to filter anomalies and recover the
underlying signal or data. However, these methods often suffer from limited
robustness or high computational complexity, rendering them inefficient for
large-scale problems. In this work, we propose a novel robust regression model
based on a Self-scaled Approximate l0 Regularization Model (SARM) scheme. By
introducing a self-scaling mechanism into the regularization term, the proposed
model mitigates the negative impact of uneven or excessively large outlier
magnitudes on robustness. We also develop an alternating minimization algorithm
grounded in Proximal Operators and Block Coordinate Descent. We rigorously
prove the algorithm convergence. Empirical comparisons with several
state-of-the-art robust regression methods demonstrate that SARM not only
achieves superior robustness but also significantly improves computational
efficiency. Motivated by both the theoretical error bound and empirical
observations, we further design a Two-Stage SARM (TSSARM) framework, which
better utilizes sample information when the singular values of the design
matrix are widely spread, thereby enhancing robustness under certain
conditions. Finally, we validate our approach on a real-world load forecasting
task. The experimental results show that our method substantially enhances the
robustness of load forecasting against adversarial data attacks, which is
increasingly critical in the era of heightened data security concerns.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何将声学滤波器技术扩展至7-24 GHz（FR3范围），以应对5G向6G发展中高频段需求。通过新型P3F LN XBARs技术，实现了19.3 GHz下低插入损耗（2.2 dB）、8.5%带宽和49 dB抑制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着5G向6G演进，需要将声学滤波器技术扩展至高频率范围（FR3），但传统平台在10 GHz以上面临插入损耗增加和带外抑制性能下降的挑战。

Method: 采用周期性极化压电铌酸锂（P3F LN）横向激发体声波谐振器（XBARs）技术，设计了首个三层P3F LN滤波器。

Result: 该滤波器在19.3 GHz下实现2.2 dB插入损耗、8.5%带宽和49 dB带内抑制，展现出强大的FR3双工器集成潜力。

Conclusion: P3F LN XBARs技术在高频段表现优异，有望推动声学滤波器在FR3范围内的应用。

Abstract: Acoustic filters are preferred front-end solutions at sub-6 GHz due to their
superior frequency selectivity compared to electromagnetic (EM) counterparts.
With the ongoing development of 5G and the evolution toward 6G, there is a
growing need to extend acoustic filter technologies into frequency range 3
(FR3), which spans 7 to 24 GHz to accommodate emerging high-frequency bands.
However, scaling acoustic filters beyond 10 GHz presents significant
challenges, as conventional platforms suffer from increased insertion loss (IL)
and degraded out-of-band (OoB) rejection at higher frequencies. Recent
innovations have led to the emergence of periodically poled piezoelectric
lithium niobate (P3F LN) laterally excited bulk acoustic resonators (XBARs),
offering low-loss and high electromechanical coupling performance above 10 GHz.
This work presents the first tri-layer P3F LN filter operating at 19.3 GHz,
achieving a low IL of 2.2 dB, a 3-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 8.5%, and an
impressive 49 dB close in rejection. These results demonstrate strong potential
for integration into FR3 diplexers.

*Shuhao Bian,Milad Farsi,Nasser L. Azad,Chris Hobbs*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合UKF和机器学习的新型攻击检测框架，无需精确建模车辆动态，提高检测适应性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPS领域，尤其是ADAS中，准确识别攻击且不依赖系统参数的先验知识仍具挑战性。

Method: 结合Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)与机器学习算法，消除对车辆精确建模的需求。

Result: 通过模拟DoS攻击验证了框架的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 所提框架在不确定车辆动态的情况下，成功提升了攻击检测能力。

Abstract: In the realm of Cyber-Physical System (CPS), accurately identifying attacks
without detailed knowledge of the system's parameters remains a major
challenge. When it comes to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS),
identifying the parameters of vehicle dynamics could be impractical or
prohibitively costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework
for attack detection in vehicles that effectively addresses the uncertainty in
their dynamics. Our method integrates the widely used Unscented Kalman Filter
(UKF), a well-known technique for nonlinear state estimation in dynamic
systems, with machine learning algorithms. This combination eliminates the
requirement for precise vehicle modeling in the detection process, enhancing
the system's adaptability and accuracy. To validate the efficacy and
practicality of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive comparative
simulations by introducing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the vehicle
systems' sensors and actuators.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GIFT的轻量级算法，通过利用噪声结构的梯度信息，直接在物理硬件上微调预训练参数，以解决光学神经网络（ONN）训练中噪声误配导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学神经网络（ONN）具有高速、高带宽和低能耗的优势，但训练过程中简化数字模型与实际硬件间的噪声和制造缺陷导致性能下降，亟需解决方案。

Method: 提出GIFT算法，通过在硬件上直接微调预训练参数，利用噪声结构的梯度信息改善性能，避免高成本重训练。

Result: 在MNIST数字分类任务中，GIFT相对基线性能提升了28%的准确率。

Conclusion: GIFT为简化数字模型与实际ONN实现间的差距提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) promise significant advantages over
traditional electronic neural networks, including ultrafast computation, high
bandwidth, and low energy consumption, by leveraging the intrinsic capabilities
of photonics. However, training ONNs poses unique challenges, notably the
reliance on simplified in silico models whose trained parameters must
subsequently be mapped to physical hardware. This process often introduces
inaccuracies due to discrepancies between the idealized digital model and the
physical ONN implementation, particularly stemming from noise and fabrication
imperfections.
  In this paper, we analyze how noise misspecification during in silico
training impacts ONN performance and we introduce Gradient-Informed Fine-Tuning
(GIFT), a lightweight algorithm designed to mitigate this performance
degradation. GIFT uses gradient information derived from the noise structure of
the ONN to adapt pretrained parameters directly in situ, without requiring
expensive retraining or complex experimental setups. GIFT comes with formal
conditions under which it improves ONN performance.
  We also demonstrate the effectiveness of GIFT via simulation on a five-layer
feed forward ONN trained on the MNIST digit classification task. GIFT achieves
up to $28\%$ relative accuracy improvement compared to the baseline performance
under noise misspecification, without resorting to costly retraining. Overall,
GIFT provides a practical solution for bridging the gap between simplified
digital models and real-world ONN implementations.

Conclusion: 该综述为胎儿睡眠监测技术的进步提供了理论支持，有望帮助早期诊断和干预。

Abstract: Fetal sleep is a relatively underexplored yet vital aspect of prenatal
neurodevelopment. Understanding fetal sleep patterns could provide insights
into early brain maturation and help clinicians detect signs of neurological
compromise that arise due to fetal hypoxia or fetal growth restriction. This
review synthesizes over eight decades of research on the physiological
characteristics, ontogeny, and regulation of fetal sleep. We compare
sleep-state patterns in humans and large animal models, highlighting
species-specific differences and the presence of sleep-state analogs. We review
both invasive techniques in animals and non-invasive modalities in humans.
Computational methods for sleep-state classification are also examined,
including rule-based approaches (with and without clustering-based
preprocessing) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Finally, we
discuss how intrauterine conditions such as hypoxia and fetal growth
restriction can disrupt fetal sleep. This review provides a comprehensive
foundation for the development of objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal
sleep monitoring technologies to support early diagnosis and intervention in
prenatal care.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UnMix-NeRF将光谱解混引入NeRF，实现了高光谱新视图合成与无监督材料分割的联合建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF分割方法依赖RGB数据，缺乏材料特性，限制了准确的材质感知，影响了机器人、增强现实等应用。

Method: 通过扩散和镜面反射分量建模光谱反射率，利用学习的全局端元和点级丰度分布，实现无监督材料聚类。

Result: 实验表明，UnMix-NeRF在光谱重建和材料分割上优于现有方法，并支持基于材料的场景编辑。

Conclusion: UnMix-NeRF通过引入光谱特性，显著提升了NeRF在材料感知方面的能力，拓展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

### [19] [Single-shot HDR using conventional image sensor shutter functions and optical randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22426)
*Xiang Dai,Kyrollos Yanny,Kristina Monakhova,Nicholas Antipa*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用全局复位释放（GRR）快门模式和光学随机排列的单次曝光高动态范围（HDR）成像方法，有效解决了传统HDR技术中的运动伪影和高光区域恢复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HDR成像依赖多次曝光，导致动态场景中产生运动伪影，且现有单次HDR方法在高光区域表现不佳。本文旨在通过GRR快门模式和光学随机排列，实现更高效的单次HDR成像。

Method: 利用GRR快门模式对不同传感器行施加不同曝光时间，并结合光学随机排列技术（通过随机光纤束实现），生成空间随机化的曝光图像。通过求解带有总变分先验的优化问题恢复HDR数据。

Result: 仿真和实验表明，该方法在10%以上像素饱和时优于其他单次HDR方法，且在1%饱和时表现相当。物理原型使用8位传感器实现了73dB的动态范围。

Conclusion: 该方法通过GRR快门和光学随机排列，显著提升了单次HDR成像的性能，尤其在处理高光区域和大动态范围场景时表现突出。

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the
dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple
exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging
dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR
data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many
established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image
detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize
the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR
shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the
sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the
sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.
The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization
problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many
sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest
saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an
off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle
is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our
prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with
48dB dynamic range.

Result: 训练速度提升8.8倍，内存使用减少10倍，存储节省42%，性能影响极小。

Conclusion: dreaMLearning为资源受限场景（如边缘计算）提供了高效且可扩展的学习方案。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements, machine learning, particularly deep learning, is
hindered by the need for large amounts of labeled data to learn meaningful
patterns without overfitting and immense demands for computation and storage,
which motivate research into architectures that can achieve good performance
with fewer resources. This paper introduces dreaMLearning, a novel framework
that enables learning from compressed data without decompression, built upon
Entropy-based Generalized Deduplication (EntroGeDe), an entropy-driven lossless
compression method that consolidates information into a compact set of
representative samples. DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types,
tasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and
classification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning
accelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts
storage by 42%, with a minimal impact on model performance. These advancements
enhance diverse ML applications, including distributed and federated learning,
and tinyML on resource-constrained edge devices, unlocking new possibilities
for efficient and scalable learning.

### [21] [Evaluating Redundancy Mitigation in Vulnerable Road User Awareness Messages for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22052)
*Nico Ostendorf,Keno Garlichs,Lars Wolf*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 研究评估了冗余缓解（RM）技术在减少车联网（V2X）通信中冗余信息的效果，特别针对骑行者。结果表明，RM虽能降低信道负载，但会减少骑行者感知率，且现有标准存在信息过时问题。提出改进的RM机制，平衡了信道负载和安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车联网通信中设备数量增加导致信道负载加重，冗余信息传输问题突出。研究旨在评估RM技术在减少冗余信息传输中的作用，以提升骑行者等弱势道路使用者（VRU）的安全。

Method: 基于德国汉诺威的高密度骑行场景，通过仿真研究评估RM对信道负载（CBR）和安全（VPR）的影响，并分析位置、速度和方向信息差异。提出改进的RM机制。

Result: 标准RM虽降低信道负载，但减少了VPR，且存在信息过时问题。改进的RM机制显著降低最大CBR，同时VPR下降较少，且在信息准确性上表现更好。

Conclusion: 需进一步优化RM技术以平衡信道负载和VRU安全。改进的RM机制为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: V2X communication has become crucial for enhancing road safety, especially
for Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) such as pedestrians and cyclists. However, the
increasing number of devices communicating on the same channels will lead to
significant channel load. To address this issue this study evaluates the
effectiveness of Redundancy Mitigation (RM) for VRU Awareness Messages (VAM),
focusing specifically on cyclists. The objective of RM is to minimize the
transmission of redundant information. We conducted a simulation study using a
urban scenario with a high bicycle density based on traffic data from Hannover,
Germany. This study assessed the impact of RM on channel load, measured by
Channel Busy Ratio (CBR), and safety, measured by VRU Perception Rate (VPR) in
simulation. To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the RM mechanisms, we
analyzed the actual differences in position, speed, and heading between the ego
VRU and the VRU, which was assumed to be redundant. Our findings indicate that
while RM can reduce channel congestion, it also leads to a decrease in VPR. The
analysis of actual differences revealed that the RM mechanism standardized by
ETSI often uses outdated information, leading to significant discrepancies in
position, speed, and heading, which could result in dangerous situations. To
address these limitations, we propose an adapted RM mechanism that improves the
balance between reducing channel load and maintaining VRU awareness. The
adapted approach shows a significant reduction in maximum CBR and a less
significant decrease in VPR compared to the standardized RM. Moreover, it
demonstrates better performance in the actual differences in position, speed,
and heading, thereby enhancing overall safety. Our results highlight the need
for further research to optimize RM techniques and ensure they effectively
enhance V2X communication without compromising the safety of VRUs.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多智能反射面（IRS）辅助的集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统，通过优化部署多IRS以提升通信自由度（DoFs）和感知性能，揭示了感知与通信之间的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统中，如何通过多IRS部署提升性能，并量化感知与通信之间的权衡关系。

Method: 提出了一种混合多IRS架构，包括被动IRS和半被动IRS，优化BS发射协方差矩阵、IRS相移和IRS数量。

Result: 理论分析表明，IRS数量增加能提升通信自由度，但会提高感知误差边界（CRB）；仿真验证了设计优越性。

Conclusion: 多IRS设计通过优化资源分配和架构选择，有效平衡ISAC系统的感知与通信性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates a multi-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where multiple IRSs are
strategically deployed not only to assist the communication from a
multi-antenna base station (BS) to a multi-antenna communication user (CU), but
also enable the sensing service for a point target in the non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) region of the BS. First, we propose a hybrid multi-IRS architecture,
which consists of several passive IRSs and one semi-passive IRS equipped with
both active sensors and reflecting elements. To be specific, the active sensors
are exploited to receive the echo signals for estimating the target's angle
information, and the multiple reflecting paths provided by multi-IRS are
employed to improve the degree of freedoms (DoFs) of communication. Under the
given budget on the number of total IRSs elements, we theoretically show that
increasing the number of deployed IRSs is beneficial for improving DoFs of
spatial multiplexing for communication while increasing the Cramer-Rao bound
(CRB) of target estimation, which unveils a fundamental tradeoff between the
sensing and communication performance. To characterize the rate-CRB tradeoff,
we study a rate maximization problem, by optimizing the BS transmit covariance
matrix, IRSs phase-shifts, and the number of deployed IRSs, subject to a
maximum CRB constraint. Analytical results reveal that the
communication-oriented design becomes optimal when the total number of IRSs
elements exceeds a certain threshold, wherein the relationships of the rate and
CRB with the number of IRS elements/sensors, transmit power, and the number of
deployed IRSs are theoretically derived and demystified. Simulation results
validate our theoretical findings and also demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed designs over the benchmark schemes.

Motivation: 现有蜂窝和无小区两种大规模MIMO模式各有局限性，蜂窝模式在小区边缘效率低，无小区模式实现成本高。

Method: 提出异构大规模MIMO（HmMIMO），将集中式和分布式天线结合，在小区边缘部署分布式天线辅助中心基站。

Result: HmMIMO在性能和实现复杂度之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: HmMIMO是一种有前景的折中方案，为大规模MIMO网络提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) has evolved along two tracks:
cellular and cell-free, each with unique advantages and limitations. The
cellular approach suffers from worse user spectral efficiency at cell edges,
whereas the cell-free approach incurs high implementation costs due to a
large-scale distributed infrastructure. This paper introduces a novel
networking paradigm, termed heterogeneous massive MIMO (HmMIMO), which
seamlessly integrates co-located and distributed antennas. Differing from two
conventional paradigms, HmMIMO remains a base station with a large antenna
array at the center of each cell, aided by distributed antennas deployed at
cell edges. Our findings demonstrate that this paradigm achieves a favorable
trade-off between performance and implementation complexity.
