### [1] [Joint Motion, Angle, and Range Estimation in Near-Field under Array Calibration Imperfections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13463)
*Ahmed Hussain,Asmaa Abdallah,Abdulkadir Celik,Ahmed M. Eltawil*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过2D-DFT将信号投影到角度-多普勒域，结合低复杂度算法和MUSIC方法，高效估计近场目标的位置和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近场通信中，目标位置和速度参数耦合，传统联合估计计算量大。需要一种低复杂度且准确的方法。

Method: 采用2D-DFT投影到角度-多普勒域，利用谱特性进行粗估计，再通过MUSIC细化。

Result: 仿真显示位置和速度估计的NMSE为-40 dB，计算复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: 新方法高效准确地估计了近场目标运动参数，适用于UM-MIMO系统。

Abstract: Ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output MIMO (UM-MIMO) leverages large
antenna arrays at high frequencies, transitioning communication paradigm into
the radiative near-field (NF), where spherical wavefronts enable full-vector
estimation of both target location and velocity. However, location and motion
parameters become inherently coupled in this regime, making their joint
estimation computationally demanding. To overcome this, we propose a novel
approach that projects the received two-dimensional space-time signal onto the
angle-Doppler domain using a two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform
(2D-DFT). Our analysis reveals that the resulting angular spread is centered at
the target's true angle, with its width determined by the target's range.
Similarly, transverse motion induces a Doppler spread centered at the true
radial velocity, with the width of Doppler spread proportional to the
transverse velocity. Exploiting these spectral characteristics, we develop a
low-complexity algorithm that provides coarse estimates of angle, range, and
velocity, which are subsequently refined using one-dimensional multiple signal
classification (MUSIC) applied independently to each parameter. The proposed
method enables accurate and efficient estimation of NF target motion
parameters. Simulation results demonstrate a normalized mean squared error
(NMSE) of -40 dB for location and velocity estimates compared to maximum
likelihood estimation, while significantly reducing computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低地球轨道（LEO）空间碎片增多对卫星星座轨道安全的挑战，探索ISAC系统的双重功能（环境传感和数据通信）。

Method: 结合正弦波和啁啾（chirp）雷达波形，研究SSK调制在ISAC中的性能表现。

Result: 两种波形在SSK下具有相当的误码率（BER）性能；啁啾波形在距离估算和速度检测精度上优于正弦波。

Conclusion: SSK是ISAC的有效调制方案，波形选择对优化传感性能至关重要，为空间碎片监测的高效ISAC系统设计提供支持。

Abstract: The proliferation of space debris in low Earth orbit (LEO) presents critical
challenges for orbital safety, particularly for satellite constellations.
Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems provide a promising dual
function solution by enabling both environmental sensing and data
communication. This study explores the use of space shift keying (SSK)
modulation within ISAC frameworks, evaluating its performance when combined
with sinusoidal and chirp radar waveforms. SSK is particularly attractive due
to its low hardware complexity and robust communication performance. Our
results demonstrate that both waveforms achieve comparable bit error rate (BER)
performance under SSK, validating its effectiveness for ISAC applications.
However, waveform selection significantly affects sensing capability: while the
sinusoidal waveform supports simpler implementation, its high ambiguity limits
range detection. In contrast, the chirp waveform enables range estimation and
provides a modest improvement in velocity detection accuracy. These findings
highlight the strength of SSK as a modulation scheme for ISAC and emphasize the
importance of selecting appropriate waveforms to optimize sensing accuracy
without compromising communication performance. This insight supports the
design of efficient and scalable ISAC systems for space applications,
particularly in the context of orbital debris monitoring.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文介绍了StopSec协议的设计和验证，这是一种能够快速识别并阻止次级用户干扰主用户的隐私保护协议，通过轻量级水印方法和实时实验展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决次级用户干扰主用户的问题，并确保干扰能够被快速识别和停止，同时保护用户隐私。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级且稳健的水印方法，用于标记次级用户的OFDM数据包，并通过实验验证其干扰检测、识别和停止能力。

Result: 实验显示，水印方法对次级用户数据链路无负面影响，且在实时信道变化下表现稳健，干扰用户可在150毫秒内被停止。

Conclusion: StopSec是一种高效且自动化的频谱共享协议，能够快速处理干扰问题。

Abstract: We present the design and validation of Stoppable Secondary Use (StopSec), a
privacy-preserving protocol with the capability to identify a secondary user
(SU) causing interference to a primary user (PU) and to act quickly to stop the
interference. All users are served by a database that provides a feedback
mechanism from a PU to an interfering SU. We introduce a new lightweight and
robust method to watermark an SU's OFDM packet. Through extensive over-the-air
real-time experiments, we evaluate StopSec in terms of interference detection,
identification, and stopping latency, as well as impact on SUs. We show that
the watermarking method avoids negative impact to the secondary data link and
is robust to real-world time-varying channels. Interfering SUs can be stopped
in under 150 milliseconds, and when multiple users are simultaneously
interfering, they can all be stopped. Even when the interference is 10 dB lower
than the noise power, StopSec successfully stops interfering SUs within a few
seconds of their appearance in the channel. StopSec can be an effective
spectrum sharing protocol for cases when interference to a PU must be quickly
and automatically stopped.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal enabler for
next-generation wireless communication systems. However, conventional AI-based
models encounter several limitations, such as heavy reliance on labeled data,
limited generalization capability, and task-specific design. To address these
challenges, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of channel
foundation models (CFMs)-a novel and unified framework designed to tackle a
wide range of channel-related tasks through a pretrained, universal channel
feature extractor. By leveraging advanced AI architectures and self-supervised
learning techniques, CFMs are capable of effectively exploiting large-scale
unlabeled data without the need for extensive manual annotation. We further
analyze the evolution of AI methodologies, from supervised learning and
multi-task learning to self-supervised learning, emphasizing the distinct
advantages of the latter in facilitating the development of CFMs. Additionally,
we provide a comprehensive review of existing studies on self-supervised
learning in this domain, categorizing them into generative, discriminative and
the combined paradigms. Given that the research on CFMs is still at an early
stage, we identify several promising future research directions, focusing on
model architecture innovation and the construction of high-quality, diverse
channel datasets.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is poised to become one of the
defining capabilities of the sixth generation (6G) wireless communications
systems, enabling the network infrastructure to jointly support high-throughput
communications and situational awareness. While recent advances have explored
ISAC for both human-centric applications and environmental monitoring, existing
research remains fragmented across these domains. This paper provides the first
unified review of ISAC-enabled sensing for both human activities and
environment, focusing on signal-level mechanisms, sensing features, and
real-world feasibility. We begin by characterising how diverse physical
phenomena, ranging from human vital sign and motion to precipitation and flood
dynamics, impact wireless signal propagation, producing measurable signatures
in channel state information (CSI), Doppler profiles, and signal statistics. A
comprehensive analysis is then presented across two domains: human sensing
applications including localisation, activity recognition, and vital sign
monitoring; and environmental sensing for rainfall, soil moisture, and water
level. Experimental results from Long-Term Evolution (LTE) sensing under
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions are incorporated to highlight the
feasibility in infrastructure-limited scenarios. Open challenges in signal
fusion, domain adaptation, and generalisable sensing architectures are
discussed to facilitate future research toward scalable and autonomous ISAC.

Abstract: This study proposes a method for simulating signals received by
frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar during respiratory monitoring, using
human body geometry and displacement data acquired via a depth camera. Unlike
previous studies that rely on simplified models of body geometry or
displacement, the proposed approach models high-frequency scattering centers
based on realistic depth-camera-measured body shapes and motions. Experiments
were conducted with six participants under varying conditions, including
varying target distances, seating orientations, and radar types, with
simultaneous acquisition from the radar and depth camera. Relative to
conventional model-based methods, the proposed technique achieved improvements
of 7.5%, 58.2%, and 3.2% in the correlation coefficients of radar images,
displacements, and spectrograms, respectively. This work contributes to the
generation of radar-based physiological datasets through simulation and
enhances our understanding of factors affecting the accuracy of non-contact
sensing.

### [9] [On two fundamental properties of the zeros of spectrograms of noisy signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13829)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究信号在白高斯噪声背景下频谱图零点的空间分布变化，以理解零点如何勾勒信号支持区域并形成确定性结构。

Method: 通过简单玩具信号的详细计算，利用零点强度和Rouché定理分析零点分布的变化及其参数影响。

Result: 研究发现，即使在信号噪声比较低的情况下，干扰信号的频谱图零点也能形成易于检测的确定性结构。

Conclusion: 基本数学工具如零点强度和Rouché定理可以有效解释频谱图零点的勾勒和捕获效应，为信号检测提供理论支持。

Abstract: The spatial distribution of the zeros of the spectrogram is significantly
altered when a signal is added to white Gaussian noise. The zeros tend to
delineate the support of the signal, and deterministic structures form in the
presence of interference, as if the zeros were trapped. While sophisticated
methods have been proposed to detect signals as holes in the pattern of
spectrogram zeros, few formal arguments have been made to support the
delineation and trapping effects. Through detailed computations for simple toy
signals, we show that two basic mathematical arguments, the intensity of zeros
and Rouch\'e's theorem, allow discussing delineation and trapping, and the
influence of parameters like the signal-to-noise ratio. In particular,
interfering chirps, even nearly superimposed, yield an easy-to-detect
deterministic structure among zeros.

### [10] [Device-Free Localization Using Commercial UWB Transceivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13938)
*Hyun Seok Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种深度学习辅助的粒子滤波方法，用于解决超宽带（UWB）设备无关定位中的低信噪比和环境干扰问题，实验显示该方法在精度和计算成本上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业UWB收发器能够实现设备无关定位，但在实际场景中，由于低信噪比和复杂环境，定位精度难以保证。

Method: 通过分析信道脉冲响应（CIR）方差变化，使用深度学习U-Net网络提取目标反射分量并抑制噪声，再结合粒子滤波进行位置估计。

Result: 实验结果显示，系统的均方根误差约15厘米，平均处理时间4毫秒，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为物联网和汽车应用提供了一种实用且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, commercial ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers have enabled not only
measuring device-to-device distance but also tracking the position of a
pedestrian who does not carry a UWB device. UWB-based device-free localization
that does not require dedicated radar equipment is compatible with existing
anchor infrastructure and can be reused to reduce hardware deployment costs.
However, it is difficult to estimate the target's position accurately in
real-world scenarios due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the
cluttered environment. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-assisted
particle filter to overcome these challenges. First, the channel impulse
response (CIR) variance is analyzed to capture the variability induced by the
target's movement. Then, a DL-based one-dimensional attention U-Net is used to
extract only the reflection components caused by the target and suppress the
noise components within the CIR variance profile. Finally, multiple
preprocessed CIR variance profiles are used as input to a particle filter to
estimate the target's position. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed system is a practical and cost-effective solution for IoT and
automotive applications with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 15 cm and
an average processing time of 4 ms. Furthermore, comparisons with existing
state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed method provides the best
performance with reasonable computational costs.

Abstract: This paper investigates a practical partially-connected hybrid beamforming
transmitter for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with distortion
from nonlinear power amplification. For this ISAC system, we formulate a
communication rate and sensing mutual information maximization problem driven
by our distortion-aware hybrid beamforming design. To address this non-convex
problem, we first solve for a fully digital beamforming matrix by alternatively
solving three sub-problems using manifold optimization (MO) and our derived
closed-form solutions. The analog and digital beamforming matrices are then
obtained through a decomposition algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm can improve overall ISAC performance compared to
traditional beamforming methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hardware-software co-design approach to efficiently
optimize beamforming and port selection in fluid antenna systems (FASs). To
begin with, a fluid-antenna (FA)-enabled downlink multi-cell multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) network is modeled, and a weighted sum-rate (WSR)
maximization problem is formulated. Second, a method that integrates graph
neural networks (GNNs) with random port selection (RPS) is proposed to jointly
optimize beamforming and port selection, while also assessing the benefits and
limitations of random selection. Third, an instruction-driven deep learning
accelerator based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is developed to
minimize inference latency. To further enhance efficiency, a scheduling
algorithm is introduced to reduce redundant computations and minimize the idle
time of computing cores. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
GNN-RPS approach achieves competitive communication performance. Furthermore,
experimental evaluations indicate that the FPGA-based accelerator maintains low
latency while simultaneously executing beamforming inference for multiple port
selections.

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware
imperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer
device identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G
networks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have
primarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial
variations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of
these DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we
systematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting
systems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a
consistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where
a device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis
based on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can
be exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude
into the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received
signals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and
signal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be
mitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence
thresholds.

Abstract: Linear and nonlinear distortions in optical communication signals are
equalized using an integrated feed-forward Photonic Neural Network (PNN). The
PNN is based on a linear stage made of an 8-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR)
filter, featuring tunable amplitude and phase weights at each tap, and of a
nonlinear stage achieved through the square modulus operation at the
end-of-line photodetector. Within an Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection
(IMDD) system, the PNN is applied to 2-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM2)
optical signals undergoing multi-span propagation. Each 50 km segment includes
fiber transmission, optical power restoration, and optional chromatic
dispersion compensation via a Tunable Dispersion Compensator. Positioned at the
receiver, the PNN enables fully optical signal processing with minimal latency
and power consumption. Experimental validation is conducted using a
Silicon-On-Insulator device operating on 10 Gbps signals. It demonstrates
chromatic dispersion equalization over distances up to 200 km and self-phase
modulation (with dispersion removed) up to 450 km. Simulations explore PNN
adaptation for 100 Gbps modulations and its potential for cross-phase
modulation equalization.

free-space communications, and the realisation of novel light sources.

Abstract: Newtonian noise limits the low-frequency sensitivity of ground-based
gravitational wave detectors. While seismometers and geophones are commonly
employed to monitor ground motion for Newtonian noise cancellation, their
limited spatial coverage and high deployment costs hinder scalability. In this
study, we demonstrate that distributed acoustic sensing offers a viable and
scalable alternative, providing performance comparable to that of conventional
seismic instruments. Using data from acoustic sensing and colocated
seismometers during both natural and controlled events, we observe a strong
correlation, exceeding 0.8, between the two sensor types in the 3 to 20 Hz
frequency band relevant for Newtonian noise. Moreover, when distributed
acoustic sensing data are used to predict geophone signals, the correlation
remains high, above 0.7, indicating that distributed acoustic sensing
accurately captures both the spatial and spectral features of ground motion. As
a case study, we apply distributed acoustic sensing data to cancel noise
recorded by the vertical component of a seismometer and compare the results
with those obtained using geophone data for the same task. Both distributed
acoustic sensing and geophone-based cancellations yield a residual noise factor
of 0.11 at 20 Hz. These findings confirm the feasibility of using distributed
acoustic sensing for Newtonian noise mitigation and highlight its potential, in
combination with traditional seismic sensors, to improve environmental
monitoring and noise suppression in current and next-generation gravitational
wave observatories.

Motivation: 现代5G网络中，上行链路CSI通过DMRS和SRS两种参考信号获取，但基站将其视为独立信息流。CARTS旨在融合这两种流，提升ISAC服务的性能。

Method: CARTS提出了一种通道缝合和补偿方法，整合异步CSI估计，并设计了实时SRS触发算法，确保所有用户的感知机会充分且非冗余。

Result: 实验显示，CARTS显著提升了可扩展性，NMSE为0.167，用户追踪精度达85厘米，支持用户数是基线方法的两倍。

Conclusion: CARTS提供了一种符合标准的实用解决方案，无需额外无线电资源即可提升ISAC的CSI可用性。

Abstract: This paper presents CARTS, an adaptive 5G uplink sensing scheme designed to
provide Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) services. The performance
of both communication and sensing fundamentally depends on the availability of
accurate and up-to-date channel state information (CSI). In modern 5G networks,
uplink CSI is derived from two reference signals: the demodulation reference
signal (DMRS) and the sounding reference signal (SRS). However, current base
station implementations treat these CSI measurements as separate information
streams. The key innovation of CARTS is to fuse these two CSI streams, thereby
increasing the frequency of CSI updates and extending sensing opportunities to
more users. CARTS addresses two key challenges: (i) a novel channel stitching
and compensation method that integrates asynchronous CSI estimates from DMRS
and SRS, despite their different time and frequency allocations, and (ii) a
real-time SRS triggering algorithm that complements the inherently
uncontrollable DMRS schedule, ensuring sufficient and non-redundant sensing
opportunities for all users. Our trace-driven evaluation shows that CARTS
significantly improves scalability, achieving a channel estimation error (NMSE)
of 0.167 and UE tracking accuracy of 85 cm while supporting twice the number of
users as a periodic SRS-only baseline with similar performance. By
opportunistically combining DMRS and SRS, CARTS therefore provides a practical,
standard-compliant solution to improve CSI availability for ISAC without
requiring additional radio resources.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of active reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) relay with high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) to enhance
non-terrestrial network (NTN) performance in next-generation wireless systems.
While prior studies focused on passive RIS architectures, the severe path loss
and double fading in long-distance HAPS links make active RIS a more suitable
alternative due to its inherent signal amplification capabilities. We formulate
a sum-rate maximization problem to jointly optimize power allocation and RIS
element assignment for ground user equipments (UEs) supported by a HAPS-based
active RIS-assisted communication system. To reduce power consumption and
hardware complexity, several sub-connected active RIS architectures are also
explored. Simulation results reveal that active RIS configurations
significantly outperform passive RIS in terms of quality of service (QoS).
Moreover, although fully-connected architectures achieve the highest
throughput, sub-connected schemes demonstrate superior energy efficiency under
practical power constraints. These findings highlight the potential of active
RIS-enabled HAPS systems to meet the growing demands of beyond-cellular
coverage and green networking.
