The optimization techniques feature a novel DPD\nalgorithm, TRes-DeltaGRU, alongside two energy-efficient methods. The\ntop-performing 32-bit floating-point (FP32) TRes-DeltaGRU-DPD model achieves an\nAdjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) of -59.4 dBc and Error Vector Magnitude\n(EVM) of -42.1 dBc. By exploiting fixed-point quantization and dynamic temporal\nsparsity of input signals and hidden neurons, the inference energy of our model\ncan be reduced by 4.5X while still maintaining -50.3 dBc ACPR and -35.2 dB EVM\nwith 56% temporal sparsity. This was evaluated using a TM3.1a 200 MHz bandwidth\n256-QAM OFDM signal applied to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA.

In this system, each FSTAR-RIS element is\ncapable of flexible mobility and can dynamically adjust its position in\nresponse to environmental variations, thereby enabling simultaneous service to\nusers in both the transmission and reflection zones. This significantly\nenhances the system's spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) and service\nadaptability. To maximize the system's weighted sum-rate, we formulate a\nnon-convex optimization problem that jointly optimizes the base station\nbeamforming, the transmission/reflection coefficients of the FSTAR-RIS, and the\nelement positions. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed,\nincorporating successive convex approximation (SCA), semi-definite relaxation\n(SDR), and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques.

As these\nsystems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict\ntheir states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control\ndecisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.\nModern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including\nelectrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges\nfor modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a\npromising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state\nforecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor\nnetworks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate\ninformation across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are\ndesigned under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are\ntypically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts\ntheir ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly\nencountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy\nconversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous\nGraph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both\nhomogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among\nsensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical -\nwhich exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics.

PINNs have\ndemonstrated promising performance in sound field interpolation by combining\nthe powerful modeling capability of neural networks and the physical principles\nof sound propagation. In room acoustics, PINNs have typically been trained to\nrepresent the sound pressure measured by omnidirectional microphones where the\nwave equation or its frequency-domain counterpart, i.e., the Helmholtz\nequation, is leveraged. Meanwhile, FOA RIRs additionally provide spatial\ncharacteristics and are useful for immersive audio generation with a wide range\nof applications. In this paper, we extend the PINN framework to model FOA RIRs.\nWe derive two physics-informed priors for FOA RIRs based on the correspondence\nbetween the particle velocity and the (X, Y, Z)-channels of FOA. These priors\nassociate the predicted W-channel and other channels through their partial\nderivatives and impose the physically feasible relationship on the four\nchannels. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method\ncompared with a neural network without the physics-informed prior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINN\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e00\u9636Ambisonic\uff08FOA\uff09\u623f\u95f4\u8109\u51b2\u54cd\u5e94\uff08RIR\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u58f0\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\uff0cPINN\u5728\u58f0\u573a\u63d2\u503c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPINN\u5728\u623f\u95f4\u58f0\u5b66\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5411\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u58f0\u538b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u800cFOA RIRs\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55PINN\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21FOA RIRs\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0eFOA\u7684(X, Y, Z)\u901a\u9053\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5148\u9a8c\u5173\u8054W\u901a\u9053\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5148\u9a8c\uff0cPINN\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e86FOA RIRs\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a\nmicrophone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase\ntransform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone\npairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of\nmicrophone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of\nmicrophone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently\na more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs\nby computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT\nfunction reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on\nthe TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT\nfunctions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral\ndensities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we\nincrease the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs\ncomputed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals\nrecorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially\ndistributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in\nterms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error.\nExperimental results for different source and microphone configurations and\nthree reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering\nmultiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation\naccuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely\non a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position\nestimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591aCPSD\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u6539\u8fdbGCC-PHAT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6df7\u54cd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684TDOA\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6df7\u54cd\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eTDOA\u7684\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u4e8eMST\u7684GCC-PHAT\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2aCPSD\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355CPSD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u591aCPSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86TDOA\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u58f0\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591aCPSD\u5e73\u5747\u7684GCC-PHAT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6df7\u54cd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002"}}
