### [1] [Differential Communication in Channels with Mobility and Delay Spread using Zak-OTFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12593)
*Sandesh Rao Mattu,Nishant Mehrotra,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Zak-OTFS的差分通信方案，通过利用检测到的数据作为导频，避免周期性导频传输，从而提高能量利用率和频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zak-OTFS是一种在延迟-多普勒（DD）域进行信号处理的调制方案，尽管DD域信道可预测，但仍需周期性传输导频。本文旨在消除这一需求。

Method: 提出了一种差分通信方案，利用检测到的数据作为导频进行信道估计，并利用DD域信道的预测能力，实现持续的数据检测。

Result: 该方案不仅提高了数据符号的能量利用率，还实现了全频谱效率，相比其他方案，在较低复杂度下实现了更低的误码率。

Conclusion: 所提出的差分Zak-OTFS方案有效减少了导频传输需求，同时提高了系统性能。

Abstract: Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) is a
delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme in which the signal processing is
carried out in the DD domain. The channel when viewed in the DD domain is
predictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically,
albeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication
scheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot
transmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be
used as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data
can enable further detection enabling the "differential" aspect of the
communication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD
channel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data
symbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next
instant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it
allows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would
otherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols.
Second, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded
pilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot
scheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower
complexity.

### [2] [Achieving Robust Channel Estimation Neural Networks by Designed Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12630)
*Dianxin Luan,John Thompson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种离线训练的神经网络设计方法，通过生成合成训练数据集，确保神经网络在新通道上具有稳健的性能，而无需实时调整参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据驱动方法在新数据上表现不佳且无法在线训练，需要设计离线训练的神经网络以实现稳健的无线信道估计。

Method: 提出了生成合成训练数据集的设计准则，并进一步提出基准设计，适用于不同信道配置。

Result: 神经网络在不同复杂度的架构下均实现了对无线信道的稳健泛化性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法无需信道先验信息或参数更新，适用于实际无线通信场景。

Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables
intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate
information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural
networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel
or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new
data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training
knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be
time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited
computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing
resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This
motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform
robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information
being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to
generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that
after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error
(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network
solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for
real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further
propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different
channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks
with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved
appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations,
neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both
fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.

### [3] [A Novel Data Augmentation Strategy for Robust Deep Learning Classification of Biomedical Time-Series Data: Application to ECG and EEG Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12645)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种新型统一深度学习框架，用于处理多样生理信号，通过结合ResNet CNN和注意力机制，利用时间域串联增强数据，解决类别不平衡问题，并在多个数据集上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多传感器融合中缺乏统一架构处理不同生理信号，且生物医学数据集中类别不平衡问题导致传统方法性能偏差。

Method: 采用ResNet CNN与注意力机制，结合时间域串联数据增强策略，使用Focal Loss处理类别不平衡，并进行小波去噪、基线去除和标准化预处理。

Result: 在UCI Seizure EEG、MIT-BIH Arrhythmia和PTB Diagnostic ECG数据集上分别达到99.96%、99.78%和100%的准确率，内存占用130 MB，处理时间10 ms。

Conclusion: 该框架在多样信号类型和临床场景中表现鲁棒，适合低端或可穿戴设备部署。

Abstract: The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological
signals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient
assessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in
multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures
that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different
physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in
many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional
methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified
deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across
different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an
attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:
time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to
generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase
signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in
the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps
included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class
imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced
data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were
applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the
proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH
Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,
and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types
and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and
processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on
low-end or wearable devices.

### [4] [Enhancing Urban GNSS Positioning Reliability via Conservative Satellite Selection Using Unanimous Voting Across Multiple Machine Learning Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12706)
*Sanghyun Kim,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出一种基于多分类器一致投票的保守卫星选择策略，用于增强ZSM定位方法在城区环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城区环境中GNSS信号常因建筑物遮挡和多径效应导致定位误差，需提升定位可靠性。

Method: 通过随机森林、梯度提升决策树和支持向量机三个分类器进行LOS/NLOS分类，仅在所有分类器一致且置信度达标时选择卫星。

Result: 实验显示该方法显著提升定位成功率和接收器包含率，定位可靠性明显增强。

Conclusion: 该策略有效提升城区GNSS定位的可靠性，尽管卫星数量减少可能导致定位边界略微增加。

Abstract: In urban environments, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning
is often compromised by signal blockages and multipath effects caused by
buildings, leading to significant positioning errors. To address this issue,
this study proposes a robust enhancement of zonotope shadow matching
(ZSM)-based positioning by employing a conservative satellite selection
strategy using unanimous voting across multiple machine learning classifiers.
Three distinct models - random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree
(GBDT), and support vector machine (SVM) - were trained to perform
line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) classification based on global
positioning system (GPS) signal features. A satellite is selected for
positioning only when all classifiers unanimously agree on its classification
and their associated confidence scores exceed a threshold. Experiments with
real-world GPS data collected in dense urban areas demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly improves the positioning success rate and the
receiver containment rate, even with imperfect LOS/NLOS classification.
Although a slight increase in the position bound was observed due to the
reduced number of satellites used, overall positioning reliability was
substantially enhanced, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach
in urban GNSS environments.

### [5] [Beamforming Tradeoff for Sensing and Communication in Cell-Free MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12917)
*Xi Ding,Luca Kunz,E. Jorswieck*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于半定松弛（SDR）的优化框架，用于小规模无蜂窝MIMO系统中的联合感知与通信（JSAC），保证了全局最优解且无需后处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JSAC优化方法缺乏全局最优性或需要额外降秩步骤，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出SDR框架，无需后处理即可获得全局最优解，并引入单独波束成形策略作为性能基准。

Result: 框架在计算效率和全局最优性方面表现出色，为下一代无线网络设计提供了有价值的参考。

Conclusion: 该研究为JSAC问题提供了一个高效且全局最优的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper studies optimal joint beamforming (BF) for joint sensing and
communication (JSAC) in small-scale cell-free MIMO (CF-MIMO) systems. While
prior works have explored JSAC optimization using methods such as successive
convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR), many of these
approaches either lack global optimality or require additional rank-reduction
steps. In contrast, we propose an SDR-based optimization framework that
guarantees globally optimal solutions without post-processing. To benchmark its
performance, we introduce a standalone BF strategy that dedicates each access
point (AP) exclusively to either communication or sensing. The proposed
formulation builds upon a general multi-user system model, enabling future
extensions beyond the single-user setting. Overall, our framework offers a
globally optimal and computationally efficient BF design, providing valuable
insights for the development of next-generation wireless networks.

Method: 采用多星座字母表对不同chirp子载波进行调制，并通过动态星座模式选择和chirp激活传递额外信息。

Result: 推导了比特错误率（BER）的紧上界，仿真结果显示MM-AFDM-IM性能优于传统方案。

Conclusion: MM-AFDM-IM在保持能量效率的同时，显著提升了AFDM的性能，适合高移动性通信。

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), a promising multicarrier
technique utilizing chirp signals, has been envisioned as an effective solution
for high-mobility communication scenarios. In this paper, we develop a
multiple-mode index modulation scheme tailored for AFDM, termed as MM-AFDM-IM,
which aims to further improve the spectral and energy efficiencies of AFDM.
Specifically, multiple constellation alphabets are selected for different
chirp-based subcarriers (chirps). Aside from classical amplitude/phase
modulation, additional information bits can be conveyed by the dynamic patterns
of both constellation mode selection and chirp activation, without extra energy
consumption. Furthermore, we discuss the mode selection strategy and derive an
asymptotically tight upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed
scheme under maximum-likelihood detection. Simulation results are provided to
demonstrate the superior performance of MM-AFDM-IM compared to conventional
benchmark schemes.

### [7] [Unmodulated Visible Light Positioning: A Deep Dive into Techniques, Studies, and Future Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13080)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLP技术因调制LED导致成本和操作复杂性增加，且降低照明效率。uVLP技术旨在解决这些问题，提供更经济高效的解决方案。

Method: 介绍了uVLP的基本原理，对比了传统VLP方法，并从接收器技术角度将uVLP方法分为强度型和成像型。提出了分类框架，将技术分为解复用和非解复用方法。

Conclusion: uVLP技术具有潜力成为广泛部署的室内定位解决方案，但仍需解决现有挑战并进一步研究以提升其稳健性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Visible Light Positioning (VLP) has emerged as a promising technology for
next-generation indoor positioning systems (IPS), particularly within the scope
of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Its attractiveness stems from
leveraging existing lighting infrastructures equipped with light-emitting
diodes (LEDs), enabling cost-efficient deployments and achieving high-precision
positioning accuracy in the centimeter-todecimeter range. However, widespread
adoption of traditional VLP solutions faces significant barriers due to the
increased costs and operational complexity associated with modulating LEDs,
which consequently reduces illumination efficiency by lowering their radiant
flux. To address these limitations, recent research has introduced the concept
of unmodulated Visible Light Positioning (uVLP), which exploits Light Signals
of Opportunity (LSOOP) emitted by unmodulated illumination sources such as
conventional LEDs. This paradigm offers a cost-effective, lowinfrastructure
alternative for indoor positioning by eliminating the need for modulation
hardware and maintaining lighting efficiency. This paper delineates the
fundamental principles of uVLP, provides a comparative analysis of uVLP versus
conventional VLP methods, and classifies existing uVLP techniques according to
receiver technologies into intensity-based methods (e.g., photodiodes, solar
cells, etc.) and imaging-based methods. Additionally, we propose a
comprehensive taxonomy categorizing techniques into demultiplexed and
undemultiplexed approaches. Within this structured framework, we critically
review current advancements in uVLP, discuss prevailing challenges, and outline
promising research directions essential for developing robust, scalable, and
widely deployable uVLP solutions.

### [8] [Angle Estimation of a Single Source with Massive Uniform Circular Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13086)
*Mingyan Gong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的二维单源DOA估计方法，利用均匀圆阵列的大规模特性，通过角度量化和协方差计算快速估计方位角和俯仰角，适合实时处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 均匀线性阵列只能估计源方位角，而均匀圆阵列（UCA）能提供360度方位覆盖和额外的俯仰角信息，适用于更全面的DOA估计。

Method: 利用大规模UCA的传感器极角近似表示方位角，通过量化角度和协方差比较快速估计方位角，再利用显式公式计算俯仰角。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法能有效估计方位角和俯仰角，并可作为高精度多维搜索的初始点；且在非均匀噪声环境下仍有效。

Conclusion: 该方法计算简单，适用于实时信号处理，为高精度DOA估计提供了实用的初步解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of incoming plane waves is an
essential topic in array signal processing. Widely adopted uniform linear
arrays can only provide estimates of source azimuth. Thus, uniform circular
arrays (UCAs) are attractive in that they can provide $360^{\circ}$ azimuthal
coverage and additional elevation angle information. Considering that with a
massive UCA, its polar angles of array sensors can approximately represent
azimuth angles over $360^{\circ}$ using angle quantization, a simple
two-dimensional DOA estimation method for a single source is proposed. In this
method, the quantized azimuth angle estimate is obtained by only calculating
and comparing a number of covariances, based on which the elevation angle
estimate is then obtained by an explicit formula. Thus, the proposed method is
computationally simple and suitable for real-time signal processing. Numerical
results verify that the proposed method can obtain azimuth as well as elevation
angle estimates and the estimates can be used as starting points of
multidimensional searches for methods with higher accuracy. Additionally, the
proposed method can still work in the presence of nonuniform noise.

### [9] [Multifrequency system model for multiport time-modulated scatterers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13130)
*Aleksandr D. Kuznetsov,Jari Holopainen,Ville Viikari*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多端口S参数的模型，用于预测多频率操作的散射结构的性能，适用于通信和传感系统的精确分析与优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通信工程中使用散射器（如可重构智能表面和反向散射系统）需要物理一致的模型以准确预测性能。现有的多端口模型未完全覆盖多频率操作和非周期性结构的需求，因此需要更先进的建模方法。

Method: 扩展了多端口S参数模型，以同时捕捉多个频率和方向的散射行为，包括结构散射、互耦合、非数字调制和非周期性配置。

Result: 通过与时空调制散射结构的实验结果对比验证了模型的准确性和实际适用性。

Conclusion: 该模型为通信和传感系统中的多频率操作提供了精确的分析和优化工具，扩展了传统S矩阵模型的适用范围。

Abstract: Utilizing scatterers in communication engineering, such as reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) and backscatter systems, requires physically
consistent models for accurate performance prediction. A multiport model, which
also accounts for structural scattering, has been developed for non-periodic
scatterers. However, many emerging systems operate at multiple frequencies or
generate intermodulation harmonics, particularly when incorporating space-time
modulation (STM) or dynamic load control. These functionalities demand advanced
modeling approaches capable of capturing scattering behavior across several
frequencies and directions simultaneously. This article extends a multiport
S-parameters-based model for predicting the scattering properties of
multifrequency operating structures. The model extends the applicability of
convenient S-matrix models to time-modulated multiport structures. Unlike known
approaches, this model incorporates structural scattering, mutual coupling, the
possibility of non-digital modulation, and non-periodic configurations,
enabling precise analysis and optimization for a broad range of communication
and sensing systems. Validation against experimental results for a space-time
modulated scattering structure demonstrates the accuracy and practical
applicability of the proposed model.

*Moritz Leuthner,Rafael Vorländer,Oliver Hayden*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 一种结合全卷积神经网络(FCN)和压缩感知(CS)的混合框架，用于解决单细胞分析中的信号重叠问题，显著提高了事件恢复和分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞分析在诊断和细胞治疗中很关键，但信号重叠会严重影响数据准确性。

Method: 使用FCN估计重叠事件数量，CS模块重建信号，并通过可解释性工具确保临床透明性。

Result: 与现有方法相比，恢复事件数量增加21%，分类准确率超过97%。

Conclusion: 该框架为非光学单细胞传感平台提供了自动化、通用的解决方案，适用于多种传感技术。

Abstract: Accurate single-cell analysis is critical for diagnostics, immunomonitoring,
and cell therapy, but coincident events - where multiple cells overlap in a
sensing zone - can severely compromise signal fidelity. We present a hybrid
framework combining a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with compressive
sensing (CS) to disentangle such overlapping events in one-dimensional sensor
data. The FCN, trained on bead-derived datasets, accurately estimates
coincident event counts and generalizes to immunomagnetically labeled CD4+ and
CD14+ cells in whole blood without retraining. Using this count, the CS module
reconstructs individual signal components with high fidelity, enabling precise
recovery of single-cell features, including velocity, amplitude, and
hydrodynamic diameter. Benchmarking against conventional state-machine
algorithms shows superior performance - recovering up to 21% more events and
improving classification accuracy beyond 97%. Explinability via class
activation maps and parameterized Gaussian template fitting ensures
transparency and clinical interpretability. Demonstrated with magnetic flow
cytometry (MFC), the framework is compatible with other waveform-generating
modalities, including impedance cytometry, nanopore, and resistive pulse
sensing. This work lays the foundation for next-generation non-optical
single-cell sensing platforms that are automated, generalizable, and capable of
resolving overlapping events, broadening the utility of cytometry in
translational medicine and precision diagnostics, e.g. cell-interaction
studies.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown promise in emotion recognition from
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by employing bi-hemispheric neural
architectures that incorporate neuroscientific priors into deep learning
models. However, interpretability remains a significant limitation for their
application in sensitive fields such as affective computing and cognitive
modeling. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc interpretability framework
tailored to dual-stream EEG classifiers, extending the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) approach to accommodate structured,
bi-hemispheric inputs. Our method adapts LIME to handle structured two-branch
inputs corresponding to left and right-hemisphere EEG channel groups. It
decomposes prediction relevance into per-channel contributions across
hemispheres and emotional classes. We apply this framework to a previously
validated dual-branch recurrent neural network trained on EmoNeuroDB, a dataset
of EEG recordings captured during a VR-based emotion elicitation task. The
resulting explanations reveal emotion-specific hemispheric activation patterns
consistent with known neurophysiological phenomena, such as frontal
lateralization in joy and posterior asymmetry in sadness. Furthermore, we
aggregate local explanations across samples to derive global channel importance
profiles, enabling a neurophysiologically grounded interpretation of the
model's decisions. Correlation analysis between symmetric electrodes further
highlights the model's emotion-dependent lateralization behavior, supporting
the functional asymmetries reported in affective neuroscience.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified and efficient framework for analyzing antennas
embedded in spherically stratified media -- a model broadly applicable to
implantable antennas in biomedical systems and radome-enclosed antennas in
engineering applications. The proposed method decouples the modeling of the
antenna and its surrounding medium by combining the antenna's free-space
generalized scattering matrix (GSM) with a set of extended spherical scattering
operators (SSOs) that rigorously capture the electromagnetic interactions with
multilayered spherical environments. This decoupling enables rapid reevaluation
under arbitrary material variations without re-simulating the antenna, offering
substantial computational advantages over traditional dyadic Green's function
(DGF)-based MoM approaches. The framework supports a wide range of spherical
media, including radially inhomogeneous and uniaxially anisotropic layers.
Extensive case studies demonstrate excellent agreement with full-wave and
DGF-based solutions, confirming the method's accuracy, generality, and
scalability. Code implementations are provided to facilitate adoption and
future development.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA
vision-based methods.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种多端口反向散射调制技术，用于无线测量线性、被动、时不变多端口设备的散射参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决无法直接访问(NDA)天线的多端口设备(DUT)的无线测量问题，提出了一种创新的解决方案。

Method: 通过切换NDA天线连接到DUT或已知可调负载网络，利用可访问天线进行无线信号传输和捕获；采用虚拟VNA技术表征OTA夹具，然后测量DUT的散射参数。

Result: 在2.45 GHz频段对1端口和5端口DUT进行了实验验证，研究了可访问天线数量和系统模型简化对结果的影响。

Conclusion: 该技术为RFID和无线生物电子学等领域提供了潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We develop a multi-port-backscatter-modulation technique to determine, over
the air (OTA), the scattering parameters of a linear, passive, time-invariant
multi-port device under test (DUT). A set of "not-directly-accessible" (NDA)
antennas can be switched between being terminated by the DUT or by a specific,
known, tunable load network. Waves can be radiated and captured via a distinct
set of "accessible" antennas that couple OTA to the NDA antennas. First, we
characterize the OTA fixture between the accessible antennas' ports and the
DUT's ports. We achieve this based on our recently introduced "Virtual VNA"
technique; specifically, we connect the NDA antennas to the tunable load
network and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas' ports for
various configurations of the tunable load network. Second, we connect the NDA
antennas to the DUT and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas'
ports. Third, we de-embed the OTA fixture to retrieve the DUT's scattering
parameters. We experimentally validate our technique at 2.45 GHz for 1-port
DUTs and 5-port DUTs, considering a rich-scattering OTA fixture inside a
reverberation chamber. We systematically study the influence of the number of
accessible antennas and various conceivable simplifications in terms of the
system model as well as the properties of the tunable load network. Our
wireless multi-port sensing technique can find applications in areas like RFID

Motivation: 现有夹持天线辅助设计研究假设完全了解用户位置，但在实际系统中这一假设不成立，因此需要研究在用户位置不确定情况下的稳健资源分配问题。

Method: 针对单用户情况，使用二分法和几何分析优化天线位置与功率分配；针对多用户情况，采用粒子群优化（PSO）算法处理非凸、不可微优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方案优于传统固定天线系统，PSO算法在位置不确定情况下有效优化了天线位置。

Conclusion: 夹持天线技术在用户位置不确定时仍可显著提升系统性能，PSO算法为解决天线位置优化问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Pinching-antenna technology has lately showcased its promising capability for
reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, especially in high-frequency
communication systems like millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. By dynamically
placing the antenna over a dielectric waveguide, line-of-sight (LoS)
connections can be made to significantly improve system performance. Although
recent research have illustrated the advantages of pinching-antenna-assisted
designs, they mainly presuppose complete knowledge of user locations -- an
impractical assumption in real-world systems. To address this issue, the robust
resource allocation in a multi-user pinching antenna downlink system with
uncertain user positions is investigated, aiming to minimize total transmit
power while satisfying individual outage probability constraints. First, we
address the single-user case, deriving the optimal pinching antenna position
and obtaining the corresponding power allocation using a bisection method
combined with geometric analysis. We then extend this solution to the
multi-user case. In this case, we optimize the pinching antenna position using
a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to handle the resulting
non-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional fixed-antenna
systems and validate the effectiveness of the PSO-based antenna placement
strategy under location uncertainty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近场ISAC系统面临多个通信用户、目标和窃听者的复杂场景，信道不确定性对系统性能构成挑战，因此需要设计高效的波束成形方案。

Method: 使用S-Procedure将信道不确定性约束转化为线性矩阵不等式，并结合SROCR方法处理非凸问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方案在安全性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法（如SDR）。

Conclusion: 该方案为近场ISAC系统提供了一种低复杂度且高效的波束成形设计方法。

Abstract: This letter investigates the robust beamforming design for a near-field
secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with multiple
communication users (CUs) and targets, as well as multiple eavesdroppers.
Taking into account the channel uncertainty constraints, we maximize the
minimum sensing beampattern gain for targets, subject to the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each CU and the
maximum SINR constraint for each eavesdropper, as well as the ISAC transmit
power constraint. The formulated design problem is non-convex. As a
low-complexity suboptimal solution, we first apply the S-Procedure to convert
semi-infinite channel uncertainty constraints into linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs) and then use the state-of-the-art sequential rank-one constraint
relaxation (SROCR) method to address the rank-one constraints. The numerical
results show that the proposed ISAC beamforming design scheme outperforms the
existing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and other baseline schemes, and it
significantly enhances security and robustness for near-field ISAC systems.

Abstract: In this letter, a pinching antenna (PA)-aided scheme for establishing a
secure integrated sensing and communication system (ISAC) is investigated. The
underlying system comprises a dual-functional radar communication (DFRC) base
station (BS) linked to multiple waveguides to serve several downlink users
while sensing a set of malicious targets in a given area. The PA-aided BS aims
at preserving communication confidentiality with the legitimate users while
being able to detect malicious targets. One objective of the proposed scheme is
to optimize the PA locations, based on which an optimal design of the
legitimate signal beamforming and artificial noise covariance matrices is
provided to maximize the network's sensing performance, subject to secrecy and
total power constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme
through numerical examples and compare that against a traditional DFRC ISAC
system with a uniform linear array of half-wavelength-spaced antennas. We show
that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline PA-aided scheme with
equidistant PAs by $3$ dB in terms of illumination power, while it can provide
gains of up to $30$ dB of the same metric against a traditional ISAC system
with half-wavelength-space uniform linear arrays.
