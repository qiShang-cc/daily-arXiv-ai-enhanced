This approach avoids directly applying convex (CVX)\noptimization for sparse selection in large-size array matrices, as such methods\noften lead to excessive computational time due to blind searching to satisfy a\nseries of objective functions. First, based on the objective function, we\nprioritize a key component and employ the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)\nmethod to pre-select potential sparse target positions. To ensure focal\nsymmetry, a coordinate mirror symmetry approach is adopted, meaning that\nselection is performed only in the first quadrant, while the remaining\nquadrants are determined through mirror symmetry relative to the first\nquadrant. This significantly reduces computational complexity at an early\nstage. Next, CVX is applied based on the pre-selected sparse array. Once a\npredefined threshold is met, a solution is obtained that satisfies the\nconstraints of the beamfocusing. The results demonstrate that, compared with\nconventional methods, this approach improves efficiency by 15.12 times with 121\nelements and 96.73 times with 441 elements. The proposed method demonstrates\nnot only satisfactory performance but also considerable potential as a beam\nfocusing technique for large-scale near-field array systems."}

It is\nthus natural to ask what the performance limit of A-SIC is in practical\nsystems, which is still quite underexplored so far. In this paper, we aim to\nclose this gap by characterizing the fundamental performance of A-SIC which\nemploys the common multi-tap delay (MTD) architecture, by accounting for the\nfollowing practical issues: 1) Nonstationarity of the Tx signal; 2) Nonlinear\ndistortions on the Tx signal; 3) Multipath channel corresponding to the\nself-interference (SI); 4) Maximum amplitude constraint on the MTD tap weights.\nOur findings include: 1) The average approximation error for the\ncyclostationary Tx signals is equal to that for the stationary white Gaussian\nprocess, thus greatly simplifying the performance analysis and the optimization\nprocedure. 2) The approximation error for the multipath SI channel can be\ndecomposed as the sum of the approximation error for the single-path scenario.\nBy leveraging these structural results, the optimization framework and\nalgorithms which characterize the fundamental limit of A-SIC, by taking into\naccount all the aforementioned practical factors, are provided."}

GSP generalizes the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean\ndomains, and graph learning is pivotal to applying GSP when these domains are\nunknown. With the recent prevalence of multi-way data, there has been growing\ninterest in product graphs that naturally factorize dependencies across\ndifferent ways. However, the types of graph products that can be learned are\nstill limited for modeling diverse dependency structures. In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of learning a Kronecker-structured product graph from smooth\nsignals. Unlike the more commonly used Cartesian product, the Kronecker product\nmodels dependencies in a more intricate, non-separable way, but posits harder\nconstraints on the graph learning problem. To tackle this non-convex problem,\nwe propose an alternating scheme to optimize each factor graph and provide\ntheoretical guarantees for its asymptotic convergence. The proposed algorithm\nis also modified to learn factor graphs of the strong product.

A restricted searched space can be\nemployed to achieve near-optimum decoding with reduced decoding complexity. For\na low-rate code with large minimum distance, the restricted search space is\nstill very huge.\n  We propose to use concatenated coding to further restrict the search space by\nproposing an improved MRIP frame.
