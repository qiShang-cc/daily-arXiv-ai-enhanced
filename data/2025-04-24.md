Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of global mortality,
emphasizing the critical need for efficient diagnostic tools such as
electrocardiograms (ECGs). Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly
transformers, have revolutionized ECG analysis by capturing detailed waveform
features as well as global rhythm patterns. However, traditional transformers
struggle to effectively capture local morphological features that are critical
for accurate ECG interpretation. We propose a novel Local-Global Attention ECG
model (LGA-ECG) to address this limitation, integrating convolutional inductive
biases with global self-attention mechanisms. Our approach extracts queries by
averaging embeddings obtained from overlapping convolutional windows, enabling
fine-grained morphological analysis, while simultaneously modeling global
context through attention to keys and values derived from the entire sequence.
Experiments conducted on the CODE-15 dataset demonstrate that LGA-ECG
outperforms state-of-the-art models and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of the local-global attention strategy. By capturing the
hierarchical temporal dependencies and morphological patterns in ECG signals,
this new design showcases its potential for clinical deployment with robust
automated ECG classification.

Abstract: We present SeizureFormer, a Transformer-based model for long-term seizure
risk forecasting using interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) surrogate
biomarkers and long episode (LE) biomarkers from responsive neurostimulation
(RNS) systems. Unlike raw scalp EEG-based models, SeizureFormer leverages

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) have been proposed as a revolutionary
flexible antenna technology which facilitates line-of-sight links via numerous
low-cost pinching antennas with adjustable activation positions over
waveguides. This letter proposes a two-timescale joint transmit and pinching
beamforming design for the maximization of sum rate of a PASS-based downlink
multi-user multiple input single output system. A primal dual decomposition
method is developed to decouple the two-timescale problem into two
sub-problems: 1) A Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-guided dual learning-based approach is
proposed to solve the short-term transmit beamforming design sub-problem; 2)
The long-term pinching beamforming design sub-problem is tackled by adopting a
stochastic successive convex approximation method. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed two-timescale algorithm achieves a significant
performance gain compared to other baselines.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources is essential
for grid stability and price prediction. Regional power supply forecasts are
usually indirect through a bottom-up approach of plant-level forecasts,
incorporate lagged power values, and do not use the potential of spatially
resolved data. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting
solar and wind power production at country scale in France using machine
learning models trained with spatially explicit weather data combined with
spatial information about production sites capacity. A dataset is built
spanning from 2012 to 2023, using daily power production data from RTE (the
national grid operator) as the target variable, with daily weather data from
ERA5, production sites capacity and location, and electricity prices as input
features. Three modeling approaches are explored to handle spatially resolved
weather data: spatial averaging over the country, dimension reduction through
principal component analysis, and a computer vision architecture to exploit
complex spatial relationships. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine
learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on
cross-validation methods on daily power production data. Results indicate that
cross-validation tailored to time series is best suited to reach low error. We
found that neural networks tend to outperform traditional tree-based models,
which face challenges in extrapolation due to the increasing renewable capacity
over time. Model performance ranges from 4% to 10% in nRMSE for midterm
horizon, achieving similar error metrics to local models established at a
single-plant level, highlighting the potential of these methods for regional
power supply forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，心电图（ECG）诊断虽关键但人工判读耗时且易错，需自动化高效工具。

Result: 在PTB-XL和Georgia数据集上验证，模型在多标签分类中表现优异，兼具鲁棒性和高效性。

Conclusion: xLSTM-ECG显著改善ECG分类精度，具有临床应用潜力，代码将开源。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality
worldwide, highlighting the critical need for efficient and accurate diagnostic
tools. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are indispensable in diagnosing various heart
conditions; however, their manual interpretation is time-consuming and
error-prone. In this paper, we propose xLSTM-ECG, a novel approach that
leverages an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network for multi-label
classification of ECG signals, using the PTB-XL dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this work represents the first design and application of xLSTM
modules specifically adapted for multi-label ECG classification. Our method
employs a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to convert time-series ECG
waveforms into the frequency domain, thereby enhancing feature extraction. The
xLSTM architecture is specifically tailored to address the complexities of
12-lead ECG recordings by capturing both local and global signal features.
Comprehensive experiments on the PTB-XL dataset reveal that our model achieves
strong multi-label classification performance, while additional tests on the
Georgia 12-Lead dataset underscore its robustness and efficiency. This approach
significantly improves ECG classification accuracy, thereby advancing clinical
diagnostics and patient care. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

### [6] [Phased Array Calibration based on Rotating-Element Harmonic Electric-Field Vector with Time Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16107)
*Shiyuan Li,Yuyue Zhou,Chi Zhang,Liang Kong,Kebin Liu,Yihan Xie,Chong He*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于时间调制原理的RHEV校准策略，用于解决相控阵中幅度-相位不平衡问题，避免了传统方法对高分辨率移相器的依赖及其相位误差的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相控阵中元件间的幅度-相位不平衡会导致性能显著下降，传统的幅度校准方法需高分辨率移相器且易受相位误差影响，因此需要一种更稳健的校准方法。

Result: 数值模拟和实际实验表明，该方法不依赖物理移相器调整且性能一致，有效解决了校准问题。

Conclusion: RHEV校准方法通过时间调制实现了高精度校准，对相控阵的性能提升具有显著优势。

Abstract: Calibration is crucial for ensuring the performance of phased array since
amplitude-phase imbalance between elements results in significant performance
degradation. While amplitude-only calibration methods offer advantages when
phase measurements are impractical, conventional approaches face two key
challenges: they typically require high-resolution phase shifters and remain
susceptible to phase errors inherent in these components. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a Rotating element Harmonic Electric-field Vector
(RHEV) strategy, which enables precise calibration through time modulation
principles. The proposed technique functions as follows. Two 1-bit phase
shifters are periodically phase-switched at the same frequency, each generating
corresponding harmonics. By adjusting the relative delay between their
modulation timings, the phase difference between the $+1$st harmonics produced
by the two elements can be precisely controlled, utilizing the time-shift
property of the Fourier transform. Furthermore, the +1st harmonic generated by
sequential modulation of individual elements exhibits a linear relationship
with the amplitude of the modulated element, enabling amplitude ambiguity
resolution. The proposed RHEV-based calibration method generates phase shifts
through relative timing delays rather than physical phase shifter adjustments,
rendering it less susceptible to phase shift errors. Additionally, since the
calibration process exclusively utilizes the $+1$st harmonic, which is produced
solely by the modulated unit, the method demonstrates consistent performance
regardless of array size. Extensive numerical simulations, practical in-channel
and over-the-air (OTA) calibration experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and distinct advantages of the proposed method.

### [7] [Micro-Ring Perceptron Sensor for High-Speed, Low-Power Radio-Frequency Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16119)
*Bo-Han Wu,Shi-Yuan Ma,Sri Krishna Vadlamani,Hyeongrak Choi,Dirk Englund*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为微环感知器（MiRP）的传感器，结合了微环动态模拟处理器和机器学习数字后端，用于低功耗高速信号检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统射频传感系统在低功耗和高数据速率条件下受探测器噪声和奈奎斯特采样率限制的问题。

Method: 通过微环非线性光学动态与机器学习端到端架构结合，将输入信号映射到学习特征空间，实现亚奈奎斯特采样。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，MiRP的检测准确率达到94%（传统方法仅11%），且采样率为奈奎斯特率的1/49。

Conclusion: MiRP传感器为现实世界中的低功耗高速信号检测提供了一种鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) sensing enables long-range, high-resolution detection
for applications such as radar and wireless communication. RF photonic sensing
mitigates the bandwidth limitations and high transmission losses of electronic
systems by transducing the detected RF signals into broadband optical carriers.
However, these sensing systems remain limited by detector noise and Nyquist
rate sampling with analog-to-digital converters, particularly under low-power
and high-data rate conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the
micro-ring perceptron (MiRP) sensor, a physics-inspired AI framework that
integrates the micro-ring (MiR) dynamics-based analog processor with a
machine-learning-driven digital backend. By embedding the nonlinear optical
dynamics of MiRs into an end-to-end architecture, MiRP sensing maps the input
signal into a learned feature space for the subsequent digital neural network.
The trick is to encode the entire temporal structure of the incoming signal
into each output sample in order to enable effectively sub-Nyquist sampling
without loss of task-relevant information. Evaluations of three target
classification datasets demonstrate the performance advantages of MiRP sensing.
For example, on MNIST, MiRP detection achieves $94\pm0.1$\% accuracy at $1/49$
the Nyquist rate at the input RF signal of $1$~ pW, compared to $11\pm0.4$\%
for the conventional RF detection method. Thus, our sensor framework provides a
robust and efficient solution for the detection of low-power and high-speed
signals in real-world sensing applications.

### [8] [A Self-supervised Learning Method for Raman Spectroscopy based on Masked Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16130)
*Pengju Ren,Ri-gui Zhou,Yaochong Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码自编码器（SMAE）的自监督学习方法，用于解决拉曼光谱分析中标注数据不足的问题，显著提升了无监督聚类和有限标注数据的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: SMAE为无标注或标注稀缺的拉曼光谱分析提供了高效解决方案，兼具特征学习与降噪能力，未来可扩展至更多光谱分析场景。

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy serves as a powerful and reliable tool for analyzing the
chemical information of substances. The integration of Raman spectroscopy with
deep learning methods enables rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of
materials. Most existing approaches adopt supervised learning methods. Although
supervised learning has achieved satisfactory accuracy in spectral analysis, it
is still constrained by costly and limited well-annotated spectral datasets for
training. When spectral annotation is challenging or the amount of annotated
data is insufficient, the performance of supervised learning in spectral
material identification declines. In order to address the challenge of feature
extraction from unannotated spectra, we propose a self-supervised learning
paradigm for Raman Spectroscopy based on a Masked AutoEncoder, termed SMAE.
SMAE does not require any spectral annotations during pre-training. By randomly
masking and then reconstructing the spectral information, the model learns
essential spectral features. The reconstructed spectra exhibit certain
denoising properties, improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than
twofold. Utilizing the network weights obtained from masked pre-training, SMAE
achieves clustering accuracy of over 80% for 30 classes of isolated bacteria in
a pathogenic bacterial dataset, demonstrating significant improvements compared
to classical unsupervised methods and other state-of-the-art deep clustering
methods. After fine-tuning the network with a limited amount of annotated data,
SMAE achieves an identification accuracy of 83.90% on the test set, presenting
competitive performance against the supervised ResNet (83.40%).

Conclusion: 该研究为边缘计算环境下高效NILM系统的设计提供了理论和实践基础，未来将专注于降低成本的电压变压器设计改进。

Abstract: In recent years, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) technology has
attracted much attention in the related research field by virtue of its unique
advantage of utilizing single meter data to achieve accurate decomposition of
device-level energy consumption. Cutting-edge methods based on machine learning
and deep learning have achieved remarkable results in load decomposition
accuracy by fusing time-frequency domain features. However, these methods
generally suffer from high computational costs and huge memory requirements,
which become the main obstacles for their deployment on resource-constrained
microcontroller units (MCUs). To address these challenges, this study proposes
an innovative Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm in the time-frequency domain
and systematically compares and analyzes the performance of six machine
learning techniques in home electricity scenarios. Through complete
experimental validation on edge MCUs, this scheme successfully achieves a
recognition accuracy of 95%. Meanwhile, this study deeply optimizes the
frequency domain feature extraction process, which effectively reduces the
running time by 55.55% and the storage overhead by about 34.6%. The algorithm
performance will be further optimized in future research work. Considering that
the elimination of voltage transformer design can significantly reduce the
cost, the subsequent research will focus on this direction, and is committed to
providing more cost-effective solutions for the practical application of NILM,
and providing a solid theoretical foundation and feasible technical paths for
the design of efficient NILM systems in edge computing environments.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) data is crucial for diagnosing mental health
conditions but is costly and time-consuming to collect at scale. Synthetic data
generation offers a promising solution to augment datasets for machine learning
applications. However, generating high-quality synthetic EEG that preserves
emotional and mental health signals remains challenging. This study proposes a
method combining correlation analysis and random sampling to generate realistic
synthetic EEG data.
  We first analyze interdependencies between EEG frequency bands using
correlation analysis. Guided by this structure, we generate synthetic samples
via random sampling. Samples with high correlation to real data are retained
and evaluated through distribution analysis and classification tasks. A Random
Forest model trained to distinguish synthetic from real EEG performs at chance
level, indicating high fidelity.
  The generated synthetic data closely match the statistical and structural
properties of the original EEG, with similar correlation coefficients and no
significant differences in PERMANOVA tests. This method provides a scalable,
privacy-preserving approach for augmenting EEG datasets, enabling more
efficient model training in mental health research.

Abstract: An integration of satellites and terrestrial networks is crucial for
enhancing performance of next generation communication systems. However, the
networks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in
dense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial
covert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous
transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to
improve the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness.
Specifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP)
under the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information
(CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert
communication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair
channel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert
constraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the
AASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional
state-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic
environments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG)
algorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to
solve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized
as the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration
process by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of
denoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to
accomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better
state-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.

performance of over-the-air computation networks. Given that channel
uncertainty will impact negatively not only the beamforming design but also the
antenna location optimization, robust resource allocation is performed to
minimize the mean squared error of transmitted messages. Block coordinate

Abstract: This paper presents discrete codebook synthesis methods for self-interference
(SI) suppression in a mmWave device, designed to support FD ISAC. We formulate
a SINR maximization problem that optimizes the RX and TX codewords, aimed at
suppressing the near-field SI signal while maintaining the beamforming gain in
the far-field sensing directions. The formulation considers the practical
constraints of discrete RX and TX codebooks with quantized phase settings, as
well as a TX beamforming gain requirement in the specified communication
direction. Under an alternating optimization framework, the RX and TX codewords
are iteratively optimized, with one fixed while the other is optimized. When
the TX codeword is fixed, we show that the RX codeword optimization problem can
be formulated as an integer quadratic fractional programming (IQFP) problem.
Using Dinkelbach's algorithm, we transform the problem into a sequence of
subproblems in which the numerator and the denominator of the objective
function are decoupled. These subproblems, subject to discrete constraints, are
then efficiently solved by the spherical search (SS) method. This overall
approach is referred to as FP-SS. When the RX codeword is fixed, the TX
codeword optimization problem can similarly be formulated as an IQFP problem,
whereas an additional TX beamforming constraint for communication needs to be
considered. The problem is solved through Dinkelbach's transformation followed
by the constrained spherical search (CSS), and we refer to this approach as
FP-CSS. Finally, we integrate the FP-SS and FP-CSS methods into a joint RX-TX
codebook design approach. Simulations show that, the proposed FP-SS and FP-CSS
achieve the same SI suppression performance as the corresponding exhaustive
search method, but with much lower complexity. Furthermore, the alternating
optimization framework achieved even better SI suppression performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的自提名框架，通过UE自主决定是否反馈CSI，显著减少了MU-MIMO系统中的反馈开销，节约带宽并提升能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的SNR或SINR阈值方法无法有效利用空间信道统计信息和非显式相关性，导致MU-MIMO系统中用户反馈CSI的开销较高，影响系统效率。

Method: 1. 提出自提名框架，UE基于调度概率和预编码贡献自主学习反馈决策。2. 采用两种训练策略：梯度近似直接优化和基于策略梯度的随机伯努利策略优化。3. 支持动态用户权重的比例公平调度。

Result: 自提名方法可减少高达65%的反馈开销，且对总速率和公平性影响极小。

Conclusion: 自提名框架通过智能反馈决策显著降低系统开销，为MU-MIMO网络提供了高效且节能的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based user-side feedback
reduction framework, termed self-nomination. The goal of self-nomination is to
reduce the number of users (UEs) feeding back channel state information (CSI)
to the base station (BS), by letting each UE decide whether to feed back based
on its estimated likelihood of being scheduled and its potential contribution
to precoding in a multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink. Unlike SNR- or SINR-based
thresholding methods, the proposed approach uses rich spatial channel
statistics and learns nontrivial correlation effects that affect eventual
MU-MIMO scheduling decisions. To train the self-nomination network under an
average feedback constraint, we propose two different strategies: one based on
direct optimization with gradient approximations, and another using policy
gradient-based optimization with a stochastic Bernoulli policy to handle
non-differentiable scheduling. The framework also supports proportional-fair
scheduling by incorporating dynamic user weights. Numerical results confirm
that the proposed self-nomination method significantly reduces CSI feedback
overhead. Compared to baseline feedback methods, self-nomination can reduce
feedback by as much as 65%, saving not only bandwidth but also allowing many
UEs to avoid feedback altogether (and thus, potentially enter a sleep mode).
Self-nomination achieves this significant savings with negligible reduction in
sum-rate or fairness.

Motivation: 传统信道获取方法受限于理想模型假设和可扩展性问题，而现有研究多关注静态信道地图构建。本文旨在解决动态信道增益地图的高效建模问题。

Method: 提出一种集成动态模态分解（Ens-DMD）算法，将动态信道增益地图视为时空视频流数据，提取粗粒度和细粒度演化模式，并设计了基于中值的阈值掩模技术过滤噪声。

Conclusion: DMD-based框架在小数据集下有效实现了动态无线电地图的双生，为动态信道建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traditional channel acquisition faces significant limitations due to ideal
model assumptions and scalability challenges. A novel environment-aware
paradigm, known as channel twinning, tackles these issues by constructing radio
propagation environment semantics using a data-driven approach. In the
spotlight of channel twinning technology, a radio map is recognized as an
effective region-specific model for learning the spatial distribution of
channel information. However, most studies focus on static channel map
construction, with only a few collecting numerous channel samples and using
deep learning for radio map prediction. In this paper, we develop a novel
dynamic radio map twinning framework with a substantially small dataset.
Specifically, we present an innovative approach that employs dynamic mode
decomposition (DMD) to model the evolution of the dynamic channel gain map as a
dynamical system. We first interpret dynamic channel gain maps as
spatio-temporal video stream data. The coarse-grained and fine-grained evolving
modes are extracted from the stream data using a new ensemble DMD (Ens-DMD)
algorithm. To mitigate the impact of noisy data, we design a median-based
threshold mask technique to filter the noise artifacts of the twin maps. With
the proposed DMD-based radio map twinning framework, numerical results are
provided to demonstrate the low-complexity reproduction and evolution of the
channel gain maps. Furthermore, we consider four radio map twin performance
metrics to confirm the superiority of our framework compared to the baselines.

Result: 数值结果表明，相比固定位置天线方案，MA方案在PSR和CSR场景下分别提升主系统速率1.62 bps/Hz和2.37 bps/Hz。

Conclusion: CSR场景在性能上优于PSR场景，且MA技术的引入有效提升了系统性能。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of movable antenna (MA), a cutting-edge
technology with the capability of altering antenna positions, in a symbiotic
radio (SR) system enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The goal
is to fully exploit the capabilities of both MA and RIS, constructing a better
transmission environment for the co-existing primary and secondary transmission
systems. For both parasitic SR (PSR) and commensal SR (CSR) scenarios with the
channel uncertainties experienced by all transmission links, we design a robust
transmission scheme with the goal of maximizing the primary rate while ensuring
the secondary transmission quality. To address the maximization problem with
thorny non-convex characteristics, we propose an alternating optimization
framework that utilizes the General S-Procedure, General Sign-Definiteness
Principle, successive convex approximation (SCA), and simulated annealing (SA)
improved particle swarm optimization (SA-PSO) algorithms. Numerical results
validate that the CSR scenario significantly outperforms the PSR scenario in
terms of primary rate, and also show that compared to the fixed-position
antenna scheme, the proposed MA scheme can increase the primary rate by 1.62
bps/Hz and 2.37 bps/Hz for the PSR and CSR scenarios, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure
communication scenario that a cluster of UAVs performs a virtual non-uniform
linear array (NULA) to communicate with a base station (BS) in the presence of
eavesdroppers (Eves). Our goal is to design the UAV topology, trajectory, and
precoding to maximize the system channel capacity. To this end, we convert the
original problem into equivalent two-stage problems. Specifically, we first try
to maximize the channel gain by meticulously designing the UAV topology. We
then study the joint optimization of the trajectory and precoding for total
transmit power minimization while satisfying the constraints on providing
quality of service (QoS) assurance to the BS, the leakage tolerance to Eves,
the per-UAV transmit power, the initial/final locations, and the cylindrical
no-fly zones. For the UAV topology design, we prove that the topology follows
the Fekete-point distribution. The design of trajectory and precoding is
formulated as a non-convex optimization problem which is generally intractable.
Subsequently, the non-convex constraints are converted into convex terms, and a
double-loop search algorithm is proposed to solve the transmit power
minimization problem. Introduce random rotation offsets so as to perform a
dynamic stochastic channel to enhance the security. Numerical results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in promoting capacity.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在100 GHz以上的MU-MIMO通信中，通过稀疏和簇状阵列结构解决波长与集成电路尺寸冲突的问题，并提出优化方法以平衡频谱效率和旁瓣水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高频段（>100 GHz）实现半波长间隔的平面相控阵时，天线尺寸与集成电路尺寸冲突导致设计困难，因此需要开发非常规阵列结构（如稀疏和簇状阵列）来缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出稀疏阵列（永久关闭部分辐射单元）和簇状阵列（将相邻单元分组为子阵列）两种结构，结合混合波束成形技术，并通过遗传算法和Algorithm-X优化阵列配置，最终用PCB原型进行仿真验证。

Result: 簇状阵列（2或4单元分组）与稀疏阵列（半/四分之一稀疏比）对比显示，混合全连接架构性能几乎无下降，但混合部分连接架构的频谱效率和旁瓣水平显著恶化。

Conclusion: 非常规阵列与混合波束成形结合可有效解决高频段设计挑战，但需根据连接架构类型权衡性能退化问题。

Abstract: The performance of irregular phased array architectures is assessed in the
context of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communications
operating beyond 100 GHz. Realizing half-wavelength spaced planar phased arrays
is challenging due to wavelength-integrated circuit (IC) size conflict at those
frequencies where the antenna dimensions are comparable to IC size. Therefore,
irregular array architectures such as thinned and clustered arrays are
developed to mitigate the wavelength-IC size conflict. In the thinned arrays,
radiating elements are permanently deactivated, while in clustered arrays,
neighboring elements are grouped into subarrays. Furthermore, irregular arrays
are integrated with hybrid beamforming architectures to manage the complexity
introduced by full digital beamforming, where a single radio frequency chain is
connected per power amplifier. An optimization problem is formulated to
determine the optimal arrangement of antenna elements where the trade-off
between spectral efficiency (SE) and sidelobe levels (SLL) can be tuned.
Clustered array configurations are optimized by genetic algorithm and
Algorithm-X based methodologies, where the former relies on a randomized search
and the latter exploits brute-force search, respectively. Furthermore, a
prototype array is designed on a printed circuit board (PCB) to verify the
proposed methodologies through full-wave simulations. To have a fair
comparison, clustered arrays with a grouping of two and four elements are
compared with thinned arrays with half and quarter thinning ratios,
respectively. The combination of hybrid and irregular array architectures leads
to minimal or no performance degradation in the case of hybrid fully connected
architectures but severe SE and SLL degradation in the case of hybrid partially
connected architectures, respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了无人机(UAV)搭载智能反射面(IRS)技术对6G等未来通信网络的潜在优势，如提升频谱和能量效率、扩展网络覆盖及灵活部署，并重点探讨了无人机随机波动对IRS性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机搭载IRS(UMI)技术虽具潜力，但其性能受无人机随机波动的显著影响，尤其是水平和垂直角度上的振动。论文旨在解决这一问题，探究波动对IRS三维辐射模式的影响。

Method: 通过线性近似和分区域分析，推导了IRS模式的闭式分布函数；利用中心极限定理和Gamma近似得到中断概率(OP)的闭式表达式，并通过蒙特卡洛仿真验证理论结果。

Result: 研究表明，无人机波动对UMI系统性能影响显著。为避免链路中断，IRS需减少元件数量（尽管会降低指向性），且空中IRS系统的性能不会因元件增加而提升。数值结果显示，通过优化IRS元件数量和采用主动元件可最小化OP。

Conclusion: 与地面IRS不同，空中IRS的性能受无人机波动限制，需权衡元件数量和稳定性。优化设计和主动元件应用是提升UMI系统可靠性的关键。

Abstract: This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent
reflecting surfaces (IRS) to leverage the benefits of this technology for
future communication networks, such as 6G. Key advantages include enhanced
spectral and energy efficiency, expanded network coverage, and flexible
deployment. One of the main challenges in employing UAV-mounted IRS (UMI)
technology is the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Focusing on this
challenge, this paper explores the capabilities of UMI with passive/active
elements affected by UAV fluctuations in both horizontal and vertical angles,
considering the three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the IRS. The
relationship between UAV fluctuations and IRS pattern is investigated by taking
into account the random angular vibrations of UAVs. A tractable and closed-form
distribution function for the IRS pattern is derived, using linear
approximation and by dividing it into several sectors. In addition, closed-form
expressions for outage probability (OP) are obtained using central limit
theorem (CLT) and Gamma approximation. The theoretical expressions are
validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings indicate that the
random fluctuations of hovering UAVs have a notable impact on the performance
of UMI systems. To avoid link interruptions due to UAV instability, IRS should
utilize fewer elements, even though this leads to a decrease in directivity. As
a result, unlike terrestrial IRS, incorporating more elements into aerial IRS
systems does not necessarily improve performance due to the fluctuations in
UAV. Numerical results show that the OP can be minimized by selecting the
optimal number of IRS elements and using active elements.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于二阶累积量的稀疏线性阵列（LR-SDA），通过设计低冗余和差阵列来提高自由度（DOF），以解决非圆信号DOA估计中信号源分辨率不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于和差共阵列的阵列结构自由度增长受限，无法满足非圆信号DOA估计中更高分辨率的需求，因此需要设计一种更高自由度的稀疏线性阵列。

Method: 基于二阶累积量提出二阶扩展共阵列（SO-ECA）的数学框架，设计低冗余和差阵列（LR-SDA），并推导其传感器位置、自由度、冗余度和信号重建条件。

Result: LR-SDA在给定物理传感器数量下可实现更高的自由度和更低冗余度，其SO-ECA无空洞，数值模拟验证了其在DOA估计性能和自由度上的优越性。

Conclusion: LR-SDA通过优化二阶累积量的应用显著提升了阵列性能，为高分辨率DOA估计提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Array structures based on the sum and difference co-arrays provide more
degrees of freedom (DOF). However, since the growth of DOF is limited by a
single case of sum and difference co-arrays, the paper aims to design a sparse
linear array (SLA) with higher DOF via exploring different cases of
second-order cumulants. We present a mathematical framework based on
second-order cumulant to devise a second-order extended co-array (SO-ECA) and
define the redundancy of SO-ECA. Based on SO-ECA, a novel array is proposed,
namely low redundancy sum and difference array (LR-SDA), which can provide
closed-form expressions for the sensor positions and enhance DOF in order to
resolve more signal sources in the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of
non-circular (NC) signals. For LR-SDA, the maximum DOF under the given number
of total physical sensors can be derived and the SO-ECA of LR-SDA is hole-free.
Further, the corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions of signal
reconstruction for LR-SDA are derived. Additionally, the redundancy and weight
function of LR-SDA are defined, and the lower band of the redundancy for LR-SDA
is derived. The proposed LR-SDA achieves higher DOF and lower redundancy than
those of existing DCAs designed based on sum and difference co-arrays.
Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of LR-SDA on DOA
estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing DCAs.

Abstract: The mean square error (MSE)-optimal estimator is known to be the conditional

technique based on Bayesian estimation. This technique uses the estimated
channel parameters to parameterize the well-known LMMSE channel estimator. We
first derive an asymptotic CME formulation that holds for a wide range of
priors on the channel parameters. Based on this, we show that parametric
Bayesian channel estimation is MSE-optimal for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
and/or long coherence intervals, i.e., many noisy observations provided within
one coherence interval. Numerical simulations validate the derived
formulations.

Conclusion: 结论表明，通过子阵列划分和贝叶斯推理，APPLE算法有效解决了近场定位问题，为类似系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper studies a passive source localization system, where a single base
station (BS) is employed to estimate the positions and attitudes of multiple
mobile stations (MSs). The BS and the MSs are equipped with uniform rectangular
arrays, and the MSs are located in the near-field region of the BS array. To
avoid the difficulty of tackling the problem directly based on the near-field
signal model, we establish a subarray-wise far-field received signal model. In
this model, the entire BS array is divided into multiple subarrays to ensure
that each MS is in the far-field region of each BS subarray. By exploiting the
angles of arrival (AoAs) of an MS antenna at different BS subarrays, we
formulate the attitude and location estimation problem under the Bayesian
inference framework. Based on the factor graph representation of the
probabilistic problem model, a message passing algorithm named array
partitioning based pose and location estimation (APPLE) is developed to solve
this problem. An estimation-error lower bound is obtained as a performance
benchmark of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed APPLE algorithm outperforms other baseline methods in the accuracy of
position and attitude estimation.

Conclusion: 结论

Abstract: Multiobject tracking provides situational awareness that enables new
applications for modern convenience, applied ocean sciences, public safety, and
homeland security. In many multiobject tracking applications, including radar
and sonar tracking, after coherent prefiltering of the received signal,
measurement data is typically structured in cells, where each cell represent,
e.g., a different range and bearing value. While conventional detect-then-track
(DTT) multiobject tracking approaches convert the cell-structured data within a
detection phase into so-called point measurements in order to reduce the amount
of data, track-before-detect (TBD) methods process the cell-structured data
directly, avoiding a potential information loss. However, many TBD tracking
methods are computationally intensive and achieve a reduced tracking accuracy
when objects interact, i.e., when they come into close proximity. We here
counteract these difficulties by introducing the concept of probabilistic
object-to-cell contributions. As many conventional DTT methods, our approach
uses a probabilistic association of objects with data cells, and a new object
contribution model with corresponding object contribution probabilities to
further associate cell contributions to objects that occupy the same data cell.
Furthermore, to keep the computational complexity and filter runtimes low, we
here use an efficient Poisson multi-Bernoulli filtering approach in combination
with the application of belief propagation for fast probabilistic data
association. We demonstrate numerically that our method achieves significantly
increased tracking performance compared to state-of-the-art TBD tracking
approaches, where performance differences are particularly pronounced when
multiple objects interact.

Abstract: Robust GNSS positioning in urban environments is still plagued by multipath
effects, particularly due to the complex signal propagation induced by
ubiquitous surfaces with varied radio frequency reflectivities. Current 3D
Mapping Aided (3DMA) GNSS techniques show great potentials in mitigating
multipath but face a critical trade-off between computational efficiency and
modeling accuracy. Most approaches often rely on offline outdated or
oversimplified 3D maps, while real-time LiDAR-based reconstruction boasts high
accuracy, it is problematic in low laser reflectivity conditions; camera 3DMA
is a good candidate to balance accuracy and efficiency but current methods
suffer from extremely low reconstruction speed, a far cry from real-time
multipath-mitigated navigation. This paper proposes an accelerated framework
incorporating camera multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction and ray tracing. By
hypothesizing on surface textures, an orthogonal visual feature fusion
framework is proposed, which robustly addresses both texture-rich and
texture-poor surfaces, lifting off the reflectivity challenges in visual
reconstruction. A polygonal surface modeling scheme is further integrated to
accurately delineate complex building boundaries, enhancing the reconstruction
granularity. To avoid excessively accurate reconstruction, reprojected point
cloud multi-plane fitting and two complexity control strategies are proposed,
thus improving upon multipath estimation speed. Experiments were conducted in
Lujiazui, Shanghai, a typical multipath-prone district. The results show that
the method achieves an average reconstruction accuracy of 2.4 meters in dense
urban environments featuring glass curtain wall structures, a traditionally
tough case for reconstruction, and achieves a ray-tracing-based multipath
correction rate of 30 image frames per second, 10 times faster than the
contemporary benchmarks.

(NPCA) mechanism, a new feature introduced in IEEE 802.11bn to enhance spectrum
utilization in Wi-Fi networks. NPCA enables devices to contend for and transmit
on the secondary channel when the primary channel is occupied by transmissions
from an Overlapping Basic Service Set (OBSS). We develop a Continuous-Time
Markov Chain (CTMC) model that captures the interactions among OBSSs in dense
WLAN environments when NPCA is enabled, incorporating new NPCA-specific states
and transitions. In addition to the analytical insights offered by the model,
we conduct numerical evaluations and simulations to quantify NPCA's impact on
throughput and channel access delay across various scenarios. Our results show
that NPCA can significantly improve throughput and reduce access delays in
favorable conditions for BSSs that support the mechanism. Moreover, NPCA helps
mitigate the OBSS performance anomaly, where low-rate OBSS transmissions
degrade network performance for all nearby devices. However, we also observe
trade-offs: NPCA may increase contention on secondary channels, potentially
reducing transmission opportunities for BSSs operating there.

Conclusion: 环境感知建模能显著提升动态室内物联网部署中的LoRaWAN网络设计，为6G网络中的超可靠、上下文感知通信提供支持。

Abstract: Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently
challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities,
and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage
approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset
of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor
office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First,
we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional
propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed
environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide,
particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we
demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained
variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by
fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy,
Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models with one to five components. Our
results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual
heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly
outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward
ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows
that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network
design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.

Abstract: In this research, numerical analysis of nonlinear pulse propagation is
carried out. This is done mainly by solving the nonlinear Schrodinger equation
using the split step algorithm. In a nonlinear media, dispersive effects exist
simultaneously with nonlinear effects. Refractive index dependence on intensity
results in optical Kerr effect which causes narrowing of transmitted pulses by
inducing self-phase modulation while second order group velocity dispersion
causes the pulses to spread. In this project, group velocity dispersion is
discussed followed by self-phase modulation. These individually detrimental
effects are shown to combine beneficially for propagation of pulses here.
Gaussian pulse is studied and propagated by using them as input in to the
nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The split step algorithm is described in depth.
Explanation of each step is included along with the relevant equations defining
these steps.

Abstract: This paper considers the distributed bandit convex optimization problem with
time-varying constraints. In this problem, the global loss function is the
average of all the local convex loss functions, which are unknown beforehand.
Each agent iteratively makes its own decision subject to time-varying
inequality constraints which can be violated but are fulfilled in the long run.
For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a
distributed bandit online primal-dual projection algorithm with one-point
sampling is proposed. We show that sublinear dynamic network regret and network
cumulative constraint violation are achieved if the path-length of the
benchmark also increases in a sublinear manner. In addition, an
$\mathcal{O}({T^{3/4 + g}})$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(
{{T^{1 - {g}/2}}} )$ network cumulative constraint violation bound are
established, where $T$ is the total number of iterations and $g \in ( {0,1/4}
)$ is a trade-off parameter. Moreover, a reduced static network regret bound
$\mathcal{O}( {{T^{2/3 + 4g /3}}} )$ is established for strongly convex local
loss functions. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the
theoretical results.
