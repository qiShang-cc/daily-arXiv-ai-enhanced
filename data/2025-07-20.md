### [1] [Differential Communication in Channels with Mobility and Delay Spread using Zak-OTFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12593)
*Sandesh Rao Mattu,Nishant Mehrotra,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了Zak-OTFS系统的差分通信方案，无需周期性发送导频，利用已检测数据作为导频，提高能量利用率和频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zak-OTFS系统的DD域信道虽可预测，但仍需周期性发送导频，影响了能量和频谱效率。本文旨在提出一种无需周期性导频的方案。

Method: 利用Zak-OTFS的DD域信道预测能力，将已检测数据作为导频，逐步更新信道估计并传播，实现差分通信。

Result: 该方案提高了数据符号的能量利用，实现了全频谱效率，相比现有方案，在更低复杂度下获得了更优的误码率性能。

Conclusion: 提出的差分方法有效解决了Zak-OTFS系统中导频传输问题，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) is a
delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme in which the signal processing is
carried out in the DD domain. The channel when viewed in the DD domain is
predictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically,
albeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication
scheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot
transmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be
used as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data
can enable further detection enabling the "differential" aspect of the
communication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD
channel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data
symbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next
instant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it
allows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would
otherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols.
Second, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded
pilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot
scheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower
complexity.

### [2] [Achieving Robust Channel Estimation Neural Networks by Designed Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12630)
*Dianxin Luan,John Thompson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种生成合成训练数据集的设计准则，确保神经网络在新通道上达到特定MSE，无需实际通道信息或在线训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在未见通道上性能下降的问题，同时满足低延迟和有限计算资源的需求。

Method: 设计合成训练数据集的标准，并提出基准设计，适用于不同通道配置。

Result: 神经网络在不同复杂度下均能实现鲁棒泛化，适应固定和可变延迟扩展的无线通道。

Conclusion: 该方法能确保神经网络在实际应用中无需通道信息或参数更新，实现稳健性能。

Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables
intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate
information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural
networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel
or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new
data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training
knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be
time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited
computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing
resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This
motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform
robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information
being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to
generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that
after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error
(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network
solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for
real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further
propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different
channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks
with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved
appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations,
neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both
fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.

### [3] [A Novel Data Augmentation Strategy for Robust Deep Learning Classification of Biomedical Time-Series Data: Application to ECG and EEG Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12645)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一深度学习框架，用于处理多种生物信号（如ECG和EEG），通过ResNet与注意力机制结合，以及创新的数据增强策略，实现了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多传感器融合中统一架构缺乏和生物医学数据类别不平衡的问题。

Method: 采用ResNet-based CNN结合注意力机制，利用时间域信号拼接增强数据，并使用Focal Loss处理类别不平衡。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上取得99.96%、99.78%和100%的准确率，内存占用130 MB，单样本处理时间10 ms。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于低端设备，展示了跨信号类型和临床场景的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological
signals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient
assessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in
multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures
that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different
physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in
many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional
methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified
deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across
different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an
attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:
time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to
generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase
signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in
the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps
included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class
imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced
data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were
applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the
proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH
Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,
and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types
and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and
processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on
low-end or wearable devices.

### [4] [Enhancing Urban GNSS Positioning Reliability via Conservative Satellite Selection Using Unanimous Voting Across Multiple Machine Learning Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12706)
*Sanghyun Kim,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于保守卫星选择策略的增强型ZSM定位方法，通过多分类器一致投票提高了城市环境中GNSS定位的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市环境中，GNSS信号常因建筑物遮挡和多路径效应导致定位误差，需提高定位精度和可靠性。

Method: 使用RF、GBDT和SVM三种机器学习模型进行LOS/NLOS分类，仅在所有分类器一致且置信度超过阈值时选择卫星。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了定位成功率和接收器包含率，尽管卫星数量减少导致位置边界略微增加。

Conclusion: 该方法在城市GNSS环境中有效，显著增强了整体定位可靠性。

Abstract: In urban environments, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning
is often compromised by signal blockages and multipath effects caused by
buildings, leading to significant positioning errors. To address this issue,
this study proposes a robust enhancement of zonotope shadow matching
(ZSM)-based positioning by employing a conservative satellite selection
strategy using unanimous voting across multiple machine learning classifiers.
Three distinct models - random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree
(GBDT), and support vector machine (SVM) - were trained to perform
line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) classification based on global
positioning system (GPS) signal features. A satellite is selected for
positioning only when all classifiers unanimously agree on its classification
and their associated confidence scores exceed a threshold. Experiments with
real-world GPS data collected in dense urban areas demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly improves the positioning success rate and the
receiver containment rate, even with imperfect LOS/NLOS classification.
Although a slight increase in the position bound was observed due to the
reduced number of satellites used, overall positioning reliability was
substantially enhanced, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach
in urban GNSS environments.

### [5] [Beamforming Tradeoff for Sensing and Communication in Cell-Free MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12917)
*Xi Ding,Luca Kunz,E. Jorswieck*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于SDR的联合波束成形优化框架，解决小规模无小区MIMO系统中联合感知与通信的全局最优问题，无需后处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究在联合感知与通信优化中缺乏全局最优性或需要额外降秩步骤，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用SDR优化框架，确保全局最优解，无需后处理，并提出独立的波束成形策略作为基准。

Result: 提出的框架提供了全局最优且计算高效的波束成形设计，适用于多用户系统。

Conclusion: 该研究为下一代无线网络的发展提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: This paper studies optimal joint beamforming (BF) for joint sensing and
communication (JSAC) in small-scale cell-free MIMO (CF-MIMO) systems. While
prior works have explored JSAC optimization using methods such as successive
convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR), many of these
approaches either lack global optimality or require additional rank-reduction
steps. In contrast, we propose an SDR-based optimization framework that
guarantees globally optimal solutions without post-processing. To benchmark its
performance, we introduce a standalone BF strategy that dedicates each access
point (AP) exclusively to either communication or sensing. The proposed
formulation builds upon a general multi-user system model, enabling future
extensions beyond the single-user setting. Overall, our framework offers a
globally optimal and computationally efficient BF design, providing valuable
insights for the development of next-generation wireless networks.

Result: 仿真表明MM-AFDM-IM在频谱和能量效率上优于传统方案。

Conclusion: MM-AFDM-IM是一种高效且适用于高移动性场景的通信方案。

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), a promising multicarrier
technique utilizing chirp signals, has been envisioned as an effective solution
for high-mobility communication scenarios. In this paper, we develop a
multiple-mode index modulation scheme tailored for AFDM, termed as MM-AFDM-IM,
which aims to further improve the spectral and energy efficiencies of AFDM.
Specifically, multiple constellation alphabets are selected for different
chirp-based subcarriers (chirps). Aside from classical amplitude/phase
modulation, additional information bits can be conveyed by the dynamic patterns
of both constellation mode selection and chirp activation, without extra energy
consumption. Furthermore, we discuss the mode selection strategy and derive an
asymptotically tight upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed
scheme under maximum-likelihood detection. Simulation results are provided to
demonstrate the superior performance of MM-AFDM-IM compared to conventional
benchmark schemes.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了未调制的可见光定位（uVLP）技术，作为一种替代传统VLP的低成本解决方案，分析了其基本原理、分类及研究进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 论文明确了uVLP的基本原理，将其技术分为强度法和成像法，并提出了一种分类法，分为解复用和非解复用方法。

Result: uVLP作为一种低成本、高效率的定位方案，展示了其潜力，但仍需解决技术和可扩展性挑战。

Conclusion: uVLP为室内定位提供了有前景的研究方向，未来需进一步优化技术以实现广泛应用。

Abstract: Visible Light Positioning (VLP) has emerged as a promising technology for
next-generation indoor positioning systems (IPS), particularly within the scope
of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Its attractiveness stems from
leveraging existing lighting infrastructures equipped with light-emitting
diodes (LEDs), enabling cost-efficient deployments and achieving high-precision
positioning accuracy in the centimeter-todecimeter range. However, widespread
adoption of traditional VLP solutions faces significant barriers due to the
increased costs and operational complexity associated with modulating LEDs,
which consequently reduces illumination efficiency by lowering their radiant
flux. To address these limitations, recent research has introduced the concept
of unmodulated Visible Light Positioning (uVLP), which exploits Light Signals
of Opportunity (LSOOP) emitted by unmodulated illumination sources such as
conventional LEDs. This paradigm offers a cost-effective, lowinfrastructure
alternative for indoor positioning by eliminating the need for modulation
hardware and maintaining lighting efficiency. This paper delineates the
fundamental principles of uVLP, provides a comparative analysis of uVLP versus
conventional VLP methods, and classifies existing uVLP techniques according to
receiver technologies into intensity-based methods (e.g., photodiodes, solar
cells, etc.) and imaging-based methods. Additionally, we propose a
comprehensive taxonomy categorizing techniques into demultiplexed and
undemultiplexed approaches. Within this structured framework, we critically
review current advancements in uVLP, discuss prevailing challenges, and outline
promising research directions essential for developing robust, scalable, and
widely deployable uVLP solutions.

### [8] [Angle Estimation of a Single Source with Massive Uniform Circular Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13086)
*Mingyan Gong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种计算简单的二维DOA估计方法，适用于均匀圆形阵列（UCA），能够在实时信号处理中高效工作，并在非均匀噪声环境下仍有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的均匀线性阵列只能估计源方位角，而UCA不仅能提供360度方位角覆盖，还能提供额外的仰角信息，因此需要一种计算简单且适用于UCA的二维DOA估计方法。

Method: 基于UCA的极角量化近似表示方位角，通过计算和比较协方差获得量化方位角估计，再通过显式公式获得仰角估计。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法可以同时获得方位角和仰角估计，并可作为高精度多维搜索的起点，且在非均匀噪声环境下仍有效。

Conclusion: 该方法计算简单，适用于实时处理，为UCA的二维DOA估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of incoming plane waves is an
essential topic in array signal processing. Widely adopted uniform linear
arrays can only provide estimates of source azimuth. Thus, uniform circular
arrays (UCAs) are attractive in that they can provide $360^{\circ}$ azimuthal
coverage and additional elevation angle information. Considering that with a
massive UCA, its polar angles of array sensors can approximately represent
azimuth angles over $360^{\circ}$ using angle quantization, a simple
two-dimensional DOA estimation method for a single source is proposed. In this
method, the quantized azimuth angle estimate is obtained by only calculating
and comparing a number of covariances, based on which the elevation angle
estimate is then obtained by an explicit formula. Thus, the proposed method is
computationally simple and suitable for real-time signal processing. Numerical
results verify that the proposed method can obtain azimuth as well as elevation
angle estimates and the estimates can be used as starting points of
multidimensional searches for methods with higher accuracy. Additionally, the
proposed method can still work in the presence of nonuniform noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该模型为广泛通信和传感系统提供了精确分析和优化的工具，弥补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Utilizing scatterers in communication engineering, such as reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) and backscatter systems, requires physically
consistent models for accurate performance prediction. A multiport model, which
also accounts for structural scattering, has been developed for non-periodic
scatterers. However, many emerging systems operate at multiple frequencies or
generate intermodulation harmonics, particularly when incorporating space-time
modulation (STM) or dynamic load control. These functionalities demand advanced
modeling approaches capable of capturing scattering behavior across several
frequencies and directions simultaneously. This article extends a multiport
S-parameters-based model for predicting the scattering properties of
multifrequency operating structures. The model extends the applicability of
convenient S-matrix models to time-modulated multiport structures. Unlike known
approaches, this model incorporates structural scattering, mutual coupling, the
possibility of non-digital modulation, and non-periodic configurations,
enabling precise analysis and optimization for a broad range of communication
and sensing systems. Validation against experimental results for a space-time
modulated scattering structure demonstrates the accuracy and practical
applicability of the proposed model.

*Moritz Leuthner,Rafael Vorländer,Oliver Hayden*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合全卷积神经网络（FCN）和压缩感知（CS）的混合框架，用于分离一维传感器数据中的重叠事件，显著提高了单细胞分析的准确性和事件恢复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞分析在诊断、免疫监测和细胞治疗中至关重要，但事件重叠会严重影响信号保真度，需开发新方法解决这一问题。

Method: 使用FCN估计重叠事件数量，结合CS模块重构信号特征，并通过可解释性工具确保透明性和临床适用性。

Result: 与传统算法相比，该方法能恢复21%更多事件，分类准确率超过97%，且适用于多种传感器技术。

Conclusion: 该框架为非光学单细胞传感平台的自动化、通用化和高分辨率奠定了基础，拓宽了细胞计数技术在医学中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate single-cell analysis is critical for diagnostics, immunomonitoring,
and cell therapy, but coincident events - where multiple cells overlap in a
sensing zone - can severely compromise signal fidelity. We present a hybrid
framework combining a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with compressive
sensing (CS) to disentangle such overlapping events in one-dimensional sensor
data. The FCN, trained on bead-derived datasets, accurately estimates
coincident event counts and generalizes to immunomagnetically labeled CD4+ and
CD14+ cells in whole blood without retraining. Using this count, the CS module
reconstructs individual signal components with high fidelity, enabling precise
recovery of single-cell features, including velocity, amplitude, and
hydrodynamic diameter. Benchmarking against conventional state-machine
algorithms shows superior performance - recovering up to 21% more events and
improving classification accuracy beyond 97%. Explinability via class
activation maps and parameterized Gaussian template fitting ensures
transparency and clinical interpretability. Demonstrated with magnetic flow
cytometry (MFC), the framework is compatible with other waveform-generating
modalities, including impedance cytometry, nanopore, and resistive pulse
sensing. This work lays the foundation for next-generation non-optical
single-cell sensing platforms that are automated, generalizable, and capable of
resolving overlapping events, broadening the utility of cytometry in
translational medicine and precision diagnostics, e.g. cell-interaction
studies.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified and efficient framework for analyzing antennas
embedded in spherically stratified media -- a model broadly applicable to
implantable antennas in biomedical systems and radome-enclosed antennas in
engineering applications. The proposed method decouples the modeling of the
antenna and its surrounding medium by combining the antenna's free-space
generalized scattering matrix (GSM) with a set of extended spherical scattering
operators (SSOs) that rigorously capture the electromagnetic interactions with
multilayered spherical environments. This decoupling enables rapid reevaluation
under arbitrary material variations without re-simulating the antenna, offering
substantial computational advantages over traditional dyadic Green's function
(DGF)-based MoM approaches. The framework supports a wide range of spherical
media, including radially inhomogeneous and uniaxially anisotropic layers.
Extensive case studies demonstrate excellent agreement with full-wave and
DGF-based solutions, confirming the method's accuracy, generality, and
scalability. Code implementations are provided to facilitate adoption and
future development.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown promise in emotion recognition from
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by employing bi-hemispheric neural
architectures that incorporate neuroscientific priors into deep learning
models. However, interpretability remains a significant limitation for their
application in sensitive fields such as affective computing and cognitive
modeling. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc interpretability framework
tailored to dual-stream EEG classifiers, extending the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) approach to accommodate structured,
bi-hemispheric inputs. Our method adapts LIME to handle structured two-branch
inputs corresponding to left and right-hemisphere EEG channel groups. It
decomposes prediction relevance into per-channel contributions across
hemispheres and emotional classes. We apply this framework to a previously
validated dual-branch recurrent neural network trained on EmoNeuroDB, a dataset
of EEG recordings captured during a VR-based emotion elicitation task. The
resulting explanations reveal emotion-specific hemispheric activation patterns
consistent with known neurophysiological phenomena, such as frontal
lateralization in joy and posterior asymmetry in sadness. Furthermore, we
aggregate local explanations across samples to derive global channel importance
profiles, enabling a neurophysiologically grounded interpretation of the
model's decisions. Correlation analysis between symmetric electrodes further
highlights the model's emotion-dependent lateralization behavior, supporting
the functional asymmetries reported in affective neuroscience.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了用户位置不确定的多用户pinching天线下行链路系统中的鲁棒资源分配问题，提出基于粒子群优化（PSO）的天线放置策略，以减少总发射功率并满足用户中断概率约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的pinching天线设计通常假设用户位置完全已知，而实际系统中用户位置往往不确定，因此需要研究在位置不确定性下的鲁棒资源分配方法。

Method: 针对单用户场景，通过几何分析和二分法推导最优天线位置及功率分配；扩展到多用户场景后，使用PSO算法处理非凸、不可微的优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方案优于传统的固定天线系统，验证了PSO算法在位置不确定性下的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为pinching天线在用户位置不确定场景下的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pinching-antenna technology has lately showcased its promising capability for
reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, especially in high-frequency
communication systems like millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. By dynamically
placing the antenna over a dielectric waveguide, line-of-sight (LoS)
connections can be made to significantly improve system performance. Although
recent research have illustrated the advantages of pinching-antenna-assisted
designs, they mainly presuppose complete knowledge of user locations -- an
impractical assumption in real-world systems. To address this issue, the robust
resource allocation in a multi-user pinching antenna downlink system with
uncertain user positions is investigated, aiming to minimize total transmit
power while satisfying individual outage probability constraints. First, we
address the single-user case, deriving the optimal pinching antenna position
and obtaining the corresponding power allocation using a bisection method
combined with geometric analysis. We then extend this solution to the
multi-user case. In this case, we optimize the pinching antenna position using
a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to handle the resulting
non-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional fixed-antenna
systems and validate the effectiveness of the PSO-based antenna placement
strategy under location uncertainty.

Abstract: This letter investigates the robust beamforming design for a near-field
secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with multiple
communication users (CUs) and targets, as well as multiple eavesdroppers.
Taking into account the channel uncertainty constraints, we maximize the
minimum sensing beampattern gain for targets, subject to the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each CU and the
maximum SINR constraint for each eavesdropper, as well as the ISAC transmit
power constraint. The formulated design problem is non-convex. As a
low-complexity suboptimal solution, we first apply the S-Procedure to convert
semi-infinite channel uncertainty constraints into linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs) and then use the state-of-the-art sequential rank-one constraint
relaxation (SROCR) method to address the rank-one constraints. The numerical
results show that the proposed ISAC beamforming design scheme outperforms the
existing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and other baseline schemes, and it
significantly enhances security and robustness for near-field ISAC systems.

Abstract: In this letter, a pinching antenna (PA)-aided scheme for establishing a
secure integrated sensing and communication system (ISAC) is investigated. The
underlying system comprises a dual-functional radar communication (DFRC) base
station (BS) linked to multiple waveguides to serve several downlink users
while sensing a set of malicious targets in a given area. The PA-aided BS aims
at preserving communication confidentiality with the legitimate users while
being able to detect malicious targets. One objective of the proposed scheme is
to optimize the PA locations, based on which an optimal design of the
legitimate signal beamforming and artificial noise covariance matrices is
provided to maximize the network's sensing performance, subject to secrecy and
total power constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme
through numerical examples and compare that against a traditional DFRC ISAC
system with a uniform linear array of half-wavelength-spaced antennas. We show
that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline PA-aided scheme with
equidistant PAs by $3$ dB in terms of illumination power, while it can provide
gains of up to $30$ dB of the same metric against a traditional ISAC system
with half-wavelength-space uniform linear arrays.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA
vision-based methods.

Abstract: We develop a multi-port-backscatter-modulation technique to determine, over
the air (OTA), the scattering parameters of a linear, passive, time-invariant
multi-port device under test (DUT). A set of "not-directly-accessible" (NDA)
antennas can be switched between being terminated by the DUT or by a specific,
known, tunable load network. Waves can be radiated and captured via a distinct
set of "accessible" antennas that couple OTA to the NDA antennas. First, we
characterize the OTA fixture between the accessible antennas' ports and the
DUT's ports. We achieve this based on our recently introduced "Virtual VNA"
technique; specifically, we connect the NDA antennas to the tunable load
network and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas' ports for
various configurations of the tunable load network. Second, we connect the NDA
antennas to the DUT and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas'
ports. Third, we de-embed the OTA fixture to retrieve the DUT's scattering
parameters. We experimentally validate our technique at 2.45 GHz for 1-port
DUTs and 5-port DUTs, considering a rich-scattering OTA fixture inside a
reverberation chamber. We systematically study the influence of the number of
accessible antennas and various conceivable simplifications in terms of the
system model as well as the properties of the tunable load network. Our
wireless multi-port sensing technique can find applications in areas like RFID
and wireless bioelectronics.
