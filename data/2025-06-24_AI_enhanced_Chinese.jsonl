We propose a two-stage estimation method based on Prony's\ntechnique using OTFS pilot signals with M subchannels and N pilot repetitions.\nIn the first stage, Doppler frequencies are estimated by jointly solving M\ncoupled Prony equations, exploiting the periodicity of the pilot signal. In the\nsecond stage, delays are estimated by applying the discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT) and Prony's method to each Doppler component obtained in the first stage.\nThe proposed method can accurately estimate up to N-1 delay-Doppler parameters\nunder noiseless conditions.

Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific\nmulti-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect\nfault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial.

These distances are used to characterize\nelement-wise variations of path parameters, such as nonlinear changes in phase\nand angle. To capture the effect of SNS at the BS side, a stochastic-based\napproach is proposed to model SNS caused by incomplete scattering, by\nestablishing power attenuation factors from visibility probability and\nvisibility region to characterize antenna element-wise path power variation. In\naddition, a physical blocker-based approach is introduced to model SNS effects\ncaused by partial blockage. Finally, a simulation framework for near-field and\nSNS is developed within the structure of the existing 3GPP channel model.\nPerformance evaluations demonstrate that the near-field model captures higher\nchannel capacity potential compared to the far-field model.

In this work, we examine the fundamental trade-off\nbetween sensing and communication from the perspective of base station (BS)\ndeployment. Furthermore, we conceive a design that simultaneously maximizes the\ntarget localization coverage, while guaranteeing the desired communication\nperformance. In contrast to existing schemes optimized for a single target, an\neffective network-level approach has to ensure consistent localization accuracy\nthroughout the entire service area. While employing time-of-flight (ToF) based\nlocalization, we first analyze the deployment problem from a\nlocalization-performance coverage perspective, aiming for minimizing the area\nCramer-Rao Lower Bound (A-CRLB) to ensure uniformly high positioning accuracy\nacross the service area.

Traditional\nwireless receivers have relied on mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference,\nachieving remarkable success in most areas but falling short in their ability\nto characterize channel matrices. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated\nsignificant potential in this aspect. Nevertheless, integrating traditional\ninference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the\nerror progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems,\ngenerative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased\nattention. In this paper, we propose re-evaluating the MIMO-OFDM receiver using\ndiffusion models, which is a common generative approach. With diffusion models,\nwe can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate\ntraditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the\ndiffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the\ndiffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying\nnoise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing\ntraining and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot\ndensities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces\nchannel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading\ndeep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in\nlow-pilot conditions.

Analytical expressions are derived for several standard\narray geometries to enable the design of the large antenna arrays for given\nsystem requirements. First, the near-field beam focusing is analyzed and the\nminimum beamdepth is observed to rapidly saturate to a low asymptotic limit as\nthe array aperture increases. In contrast, the near-field region span is shown\nto scale quadratically with the array aperture.

However, the bandwidth of these links is limited, and thus,\npresents challenges to the applicability of CF-mMIMO, especially with an\never-increasing number of users. To address this, we propose a method based on\nvariational Bayesian (VB) inference for performing the JED process, where the\nAPs forward low-resolution quantized versions of the signals to the CPU. We\nconsider two approaches: \\emph{quantization-and-estimation} (Q-E) and\n\\emph{estimation-and-quantization} (E-Q). In the Q-E approach, each AP uses a\nlow-bit quantizer to quantize the signal before forwarding it to the CPU, while\nin the E-Q approach, each AP first performs local channel estimation and then\nsends a low-bit quantized version of the estimated channel to the CPU. We\nevaluate the performance of our VB-based approach under perfect fronthaul link\n(PFL) with unquantized received signals, Q-E, and E-Q in terms of symbol error\nrate (SER), normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the channel estimation,\ncomputational complexity, and fronthaul signaling overhead. We also compare\nthese results with those of the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE)\nmethod under the PFL scenario. Our numerical results show that both the VB(Q-E)\nand VB(E-Q) approaches achieve superior performance compared to LMMSE(PFL),\nbenefiting from the nonlinear modeling inherent in VB.

The proposed metric family defines a general form of\nthe graph generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and is also\nproved to satisfy the metric properties. Similarly to the graph GOSPA metric,\nthe proposed graph GOSPA metric family also penalises the node attribute costs\nfor assigned nodes between the two graphs, and the number of unassigned nodes.\nHowever, the proposed family of metrics provides more general penalties for\nedge mismatches than the graph GOSPA metric.

Traditional MOT\nmethods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data\nassociation and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully\ndata-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer\ndistinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods\nare generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven\nMOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for\ntraining is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can\nintegrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that\nutilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model\nin Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so,\nthe performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved.\nTo ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid\nhigh-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to\nperform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines\nthe flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to\nlearn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving\ndataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff08MOT\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u5f3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6539\u8fdb\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afMOT\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5177\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
