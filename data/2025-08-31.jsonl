The high mobility of local devices\nresults in imperfect channel estimation, leading to a misalignment problem,\ni.e., the model parameters transmitted from different local devices do not\narrive at the central PS simultaneously. Moreover, the mobility introduces\ntime-varying uploading channels, which further complicates the aggregation\nprocess. All these factors collectively cause distortions in the OTA-FL\ntraining process which are underexplored. To quantify these effects, we first\nderive a closed-form expression for a single-round global model update in terms\nof these channel imperfections. We then extend our analysis to capture multiple\nrounds of global updates, yielding a bound on the accumulated error in OTA-FL.\nWe validate our theoretical results via extensive numerical simulations, which\ncorroborate our derived analysis."}

Human\nforebrain organoids cultured on a low-density microelectrode array (MEA) are\nsystematically stimulated to characterize the relationship between electrical\nstimulation parameters (number of pulse, phase amplitude, phase duration, and\ntrigger delay) and organoid responses, measured as spike activity and spatial\ndisplacement of the center of activity. Implemented on event-based tactile\ninputs recorded from the Evetac sensor, our system achieved an average Braille\nletter classification accuracy of 61 percent with a single organoid, which\nincreased significantly to 83 percent when responses from a three-organoid\nensemble were combined. Additionally, the multi-organoid configuration\ndemonstrated enhanced robustness against various types of artificially\nintroduced noise. This research demonstrates the potential of organoids as\nlow-power, adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements and provides a\nfoundational encoding framework for future scalable bio-hybrid computing\narchitectures."}

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified\nperception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes\nmethods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.\nWe define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and\nsystematically review existing methods, their architectures, training\nstrategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting\nfuture research directions.

While multi-camera\ncentralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from\nhigh computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and\nreal-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce\nnetwork bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained\nresources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of\ncomputation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this\nchallenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and\nTracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human\npose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and\nbiomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it\nemploys convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it\nimplements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH\non both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion\npipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it\nwell-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications.

Project page:\n  https://sites.google.com/view/ditree", "summary": "Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free\ntrajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical\nproblem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the\nrobot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action\npropagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and\nsolution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due\nto uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield\nsignificantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,\nthus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree\n(DiTree): a \\emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion\npolicies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search\nwithin SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of\nexpert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness\nof SBPs to yield \\emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation\niterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an\nimplementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler\ntrained on a \\emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD\nscenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than\nclassical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.\nDiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other\napproaches by achieving roughly 30\\% higher success rate.

CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and\nintroduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based\nAggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the\nvision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,\nforming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this\ncompact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)\nintroduces action intent into the language model by pruning\ninstruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level\nsparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support\naccurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention\n(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional\naction parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and\nreal-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing\ntraining costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold\ncompared to OpenVLA.
