Moreover, we\nintroduce the Proprioceptive-Visual Enhanced Diffusion Policy (PVE-DP), which\nleverages Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for multi-scale visual feature\nextraction and integrates high-precision IMUs at the end-effector to enrich\nproprioceptive feedback, substantially boosting fine manipulation performance.\nFurthermore, we propose an Auto-Matching Network (AMN) architecture that\ndecomposes long-horizon tasks into logical sequences and dynamically assigns\nlightweight pre-trained models for distributed inference. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach improves data collection efficiency by over 20%,\nincreases task success rates by 20-30% with PVE-DP, and enhances long-horizon\ninference performance by approximately 40% with AMN, offering a robust solution\nfor complex manipulation tasks."}

With their increasing use in high\nrisk situations, the ability to audit these models by determining their\noperational design domain (ODD) is crucial in ensuring safety and compliance.\nHowever, given the high-dimensional input spaces, this process often requires\nsignificant human resources and domain expertise. To alleviate this, we\nintroduce \\coolname, an LLM-Agent centric framework for automated generation of\nsemantically relevant test cases to search for failure modes in specialized\nblack-box models. By leveraging LLM-Agents as tool orchestrators, we aim to fit\na uncertainty-aware failure distribution model on a learned text-embedding\nmanifold by projecting the high-dimension input space to low-dimension\ntext-embedding latent space. The LLM-Agent is tasked with iteratively building\nthe failure landscape by leveraging tools for generating test-cases to probe\nthe model-under-test (MUT) and recording the response.

Recent\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object\nrecognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities\nthat align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,\nit remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social\nnavigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents\nand human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot\nnavigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social\nrobot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to\nmeet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social\nNavigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene\nunderstanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB\nprovides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based\nbaselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social\nreasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art\nVLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging\nprobability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler\nrule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in\nsocial scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for\nfurther research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a\nframework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot\nnavigation needs.
