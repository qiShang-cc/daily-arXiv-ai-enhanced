### [1] [COMET: Co-Optimization of a CNN Model using Efficient-Hardware OBC Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03516)
*Boyang Chen,Mohd Tasleem Khan,George Goussetis,Mathini Sellathurai,Yuan Ding,João F. C. Mota*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: COMET是用于CNN设计的框架，通过偏移二进制编码（OBC）技术实现性能和资源利用的协同优化，减少FPGA资源使用，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在计算密集型和硬件依赖方面存在挑战，尤其是在低功耗边缘设备上部署困难。

Method: 提出COMET框架，采用OBC技术分别表示输入和权重，引入四种LUT技术，并开发OBC-based矩阵乘法核心。

Result: FPGA实验显示资源利用显著减少，对准确性影响最小。

Conclusion: COMET框架通过OBC和LUT技术有效优化了CNN在边缘设备上的部署。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for computer vision
and pattern recognition tasks; however, their computational intensity and
reliance on hardware such as FPGAs pose challenges for deployment on low-power
edge devices. In this work, we present COMET, a framework of CNN designs that
employ efficient hardware offset-binary coding (OBC) techniques to enable
co-optimization of performance and resource utilization. The approach
formulates CNN inference with OBC representations of inputs (Scheme A) and
weights (Scheme B) separately, enabling exploitation of bit-width asymmetry.
The shift-accumulate operation is modified by incorporating the offset term
with the pre-scaled bias. Leveraging inherent symmetries in Schemes A and B, we
introduce four novel look-up table (LUT) techniques -- parallel, shared, split,
and hybrid -- and analyze them to identify the most efficient options. Building
on this foundation, we develop an OBC-based general matrix multiplication core
using the im2col transformation, enabling efficient acceleration of a
fixed-point modified LeNet-5 model. FPGA evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed co-optimization approach significantly reduces resource utilization
compared to state-of-the-art LeNet-5 based CNN designs, with minimal impact on
accuracy.

### [2] [Variable Block-Correlation Modeling and Optimization for Secrecy Analysis in Fluid Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03594)
*Tuo Wu,Kwai-Man Luk,Jie Tang,Kai-Kit Wong,Jianchao Zheng,Baiyang Liu,David Morales-Jimenez,Maged Elkashlan,Kin-Fai Tong,Chan-Byoung Chae,Fumiyuki Adachi,George K. Karagiannidis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于可变块相关模型（VBCM）的流体天线系统（FAS）安全分析方法，显著提高了分析准确性，并通过优化算法提升了保密性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体天线系统（FAS）在6G通信中具有潜力，但其天线端口间的空间相关性导致传统模型（如Jakes模型）分析困难，需要更准确的模型和方法。

Method: 应用VBCM模型分析FAS安全性，并设计网格搜索（GS）和梯度下降（GD）算法优化平均保密容量（ASC）。

Result: VBCM框架的分析误差低于5%，比传统模型更准确；ASC在高威胁场景下提升超过120%，紧凑天线配置下提升18-19%。

Conclusion: VBCM是FAS安全分析和优化的强大工具，对6G通信系统的发展具有实际价值。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) are emerging as a transformative enabler for
sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications, providing unprecedented spatial
diversity through dynamic reconfiguration of antenna ports. However, the
inherent spatial correlation among ports poses significant challenges for
accurate analysis. Conventional models such as Jakes are analytically
intractable, while oversimplified constant-correlation models fail to capture
the true behavior. In this work, we address these challenges by applying the
variable block-correlation model (VBCM) -- originally proposed by
Ram\'{i}rez-Espinosa \textit{et al.} in 2024 -- to FAS security analysis, and
by developing comprehensive optimization methods to enhance analytical
accuracy. We derive new closed-form expressions for average secrecy capacity
(ASC) and secrecy outage probability (SOP), demonstrating that the VBCM
framework achieves simulation-aligned accuracy, with relative errors
consistently below $5\%$ (compared to $10$--$15\%$ for constant-correlation
models). To maximize ASC, we further design two algorithms: a grid search (GS)
method and a gradient descent (GD) method. Numerical results reveal that the
VBCM-based approach not only provides reliable insights into FAS security
performance, but also yields substantial gains -- ASC improvements exceeding
$120\%$ in high-threat scenarios and $18$--$19\%$ performance enhancements for
compact antenna configurations. These findings underscore the practical value
of integrating VBCM into FAS security analysis and optimization, establishing
it as a powerful tool for advancing 6G communication systems.

### [3] [On-Grid Equivalence of Continuous-Time Doubly Selective Channels: A Revisit of Bello's Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03626)
*Jun Tong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文重新探讨了双选择性信道在离散网格（on-grid）模型下的建模问题，研究了实际物理信道中离网格（off-grid）延迟和多普勒频移的等效表示方法，并提出了适用于通用窗口函数的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的双选择性信道研究主要基于Bello在1963年提出的离散网格模型，但实际物理信道通常不符合网格假设，导致模型与实际信道之间存在差距。因此，有必要重新审视离散网格模型在描述实际信道时的适用性。

Method: 研究了连续时间、双选择性信道在离散网格域中的表示方法，考虑了收发端实际使用的时频域窗口函数，假设窗口函数具有有限支撑。

Result: 提出的通用模型适用于窗口函数具有有限支撑的情况，扩展了Bello的经典结果，并讨论了等效离散网格模型的特征和意义。

Conclusion: 论文扩展了经典的离散网格信道模型，使其能够更准确地描述实际物理信道，特别是在收发端使用时频域窗口的情况下。

Abstract: Significant studies on communications over doubly selective channels have
utilized on-grid DD channel models, which are previously investigated in
Bello's seminar paper in 1963. The DD grid is typically specified by the
bandwidth and time duration of the transmission frames. However, the physical
channels are determined by the propagation environments and they are typically
off-grid. Hence, there is often a gap between an actual physical channel and
the on-grid model. This paper revisits the on-grid modeling of practical
physical channels. We study the associated on-grid DD-domain representations
for continuous-time, doubly selective channels with off-grid delay and Doppler
shifts, accounting for practical time/frequency-domain windowing at the
transceivers. The universal models obtained are applicable under the mild
assumption that the windows have finite supports, and they extend Bello's
classical results to account for more general windows. We also discuss the
features and implications of the equivalent on-grid models.

### [4] [Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS) for Cell-Free Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03628)
*Haochen Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Pinching天线系统（PASS）的无蜂窝通信系统，通过交替优化（AO）算法解决了非凸优化问题，仿真结果表明PASS系统优于基准方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过PASS辅助的无蜂窝通信系统提升性能和用户速率，解决传统系统在多用户情况下的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用交替优化算法，结合WMMSE方法和基于惩罚的元素优化技术，解决数字波束成形和Pinching波束成形的子问题。

Result: PASS系统性能优于基准方案，增加每个波导的PA数量可进一步提升优势，且无蜂窝架构能缓解多用户情况下的速率下降。

Conclusion: PASS辅助的无蜂窝系统在性能和扩展性上表现出色，为未来通信系统设计提供了有效方案。

Abstract: A pinching antenna system (PASS) assisted cell-free communication system is
proposed. A sum rate maximization problem under the BS power budget constraint
and PA deployment constraint is formulated. To tackle the proposed non-convex
optimization problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed.
In particular, the digital beamforming sub-problem is solved using the weighted
minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method, whereas the pinching beamforming
sub-problem is handled via a penalty based approach combined with element-wise
optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the PASS assisted
cell-free systems achieve superior performance over benchmark schemes; 2)
increasing the number of PAs per waveguides can improve the advantage of PASS
assisted cell-free systems; and 3) the cell-free architecture mitigates the
average user rate degradation as the number of users increases.

### [5] [Towards Secure ISAC Beamforming: How Many Dedicated Sensing Beams Are Required?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03749)
*Fanghao Xia,Zesong Fei,Xinyi Wang,Nanchi Su,Zhaolin Wang,Yuanwei Liu,Jie Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了多用户多窃听者的ISAC系统中感应辅助的安全通信，提出了一个基于分数规划和交替优化的算法，并在全数字和混合模拟数字阵列上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在多用户多窃听者的ISAC系统中如何利用专用感应信号提升通信安全性，同时满足感应和通信的双重需求。

Method: 提出了一种基于分数规划的交替优化算法，结合SCA和SDR处理非凸约束，并扩展到HAD阵列结构，利用流形优化解决单位模约束。

Result: 仿真表明，少量感应波束即可满足感应和干扰需求，所提设计显著优于基线方法，同时揭示了通信与感应之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该研究为ISAC系统中的安全通信提供了有效解决方案，尤其在阵列架构设计上具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, sensing-assisted secure communication in a multi-user
multi-eavesdropper integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is
investigated. Confidential communication signals and dedicated sensing signals
are jointly transmitted by a base station (BS) to simultaneously serve users
and sense aerial eavesdroppers (AEs). A sum rate maximization problem is
formulated under AEs' Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and
sensing Signal-to-Clutter-plus-Noise Ratio (SCNR) constraints. A
fractional-programming-based alternating optimization algorithm is developed to
solve this problem for fully digital arrays, where successive convex
approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) are leveraged to handle
non-convex constraints. Furthermore, the minimum number of dedicated sensing
beams is analyzed via a worst-case rank bound, upon which the proposed
beamforming design is further extended to the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) array
architecture, where the unit-modulus constraint is addressed by manifold
optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that only a small number of
sensing beams are sufficient for both sensing and jamming AEs, and the proposed
designs consistently outperform strong baselines while also revealing the
communication-sensing trade-off.

### [6] [A Benchmark Study of Deep Learning Methods for Multi-Label Pediatric Electrocardiogram-Based Cardiovascular Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03780)
*Yiqiao Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文首次在ZZU-pECG数据集上对多标签儿童心血管疾病分类进行了深度学习基准研究，评估了四种代表性模型，结果表明模型表现良好，但也指出了罕见病分类的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是儿科健康的重要负担，早期筛查至关重要，心电图是一种非侵入性且易于获取的工具。

Method: 在ZZU-pECG数据集上系统评估了四种深度学习模型（ResNet-1D、BiLSTM、Transformer和Mamba 2），包括9导联和12导联配置。

Result: 所有模型均表现优异，Hamming Loss低至0.0069，F1分数大多超过85%。ResNet-1D在12导联子集上的macro-F1达到94.67%。

Conclusion: 研究为儿科心电图应用提供了可复用的基准模型，并指出了未来需要更大规模、多中心验证和更广泛疾病覆盖的方向。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major pediatric health burden, and early
screening is of critical importance. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a
noninvasive and accessible tool, is well suited for this purpose. This paper
presents the first benchmark study of deep learning for multi-label pediatric
CVD classification on the recently released ZZU-pECG dataset, comprising 3716
recordings with 19 CVD categories. We systematically evaluate four
representative paradigms--ResNet-1D, BiLSTM, Transformer, and Mamba 2--under
both 9-lead and 12-lead configurations. All models achieved strong results,
with Hamming Loss as low as 0.0069 and F1-scores above 85% in most settings.
ResNet-1D reached a macro-F1 of 94.67% on the 12-lead subset, while BiLSTM and
Transformer also showed competitive performance. Per-class analysis indicated
challenges for rare conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the
9-lead subset, reflecting the effect of limited positive samples. This
benchmark establishes reusable baselines and highlights complementary strengths
across paradigms. It further points to the need for larger-scale, multi-center
validation, age-stratified analysis, and broader disease coverage to support
real-world pediatric ECG applications.

### [7] [Toward Multiband Sensing in FR3: Frequency Anisotropy Characterization and Non-Contiguous Bands Aggregation Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03787)
*Jacopo Pegoraro,Gianmaria Ventura,Dario Tagliaferri,Marco Mezzavilla,Andrea Bedin,Michele Rossi,Joerg Widmer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了6G网络中7-24 GHz频段（FR3）的多频段集成感知与通信（ISAC）技术，首次提出了针对FR3的相干多频段感知方法，解决了频谱非连续性和频率各向异性导致的挑战，并提出新算法优化感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FR3频段为6G提供了前所未有的带宽多样性和感知机会，但其频率各向异性和非连续频谱特性对现有多频段ISAC技术提出了挑战，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 通过实验表征目标的频率各向异性，提出新的相位相干性度量，并设计算法以消除非连续频段带来的感知伪影。

Result: 新算法优于现有技术，为FR3多频段ISAC的开发奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决FR3频段ISAC的关键问题提供了初步解决方案，推动了6G多频段感知技术的发展。

Abstract: Frequency Range 3 (FR3) in the 7-24 GHz band will be the new spectrum for 6G
wireless networks. The bandwidth availability and diversity of FR3 offer
unprecedented opportunities for coherent multiband Integrated Sensing and
Communications (ISAC), which aggregates the carrier phase information from
multiple frequency bands to increase the sensing resolution to the cm-level.
However, the frequency anisotropy of sensing targets over GHz-wide bands and
the non-contiguity of the 6G spectrum, pose critical challenges to the
application of existing multiband ISAC techniques. We present the first study
on coherent multiband sensing in FR3. We experimentally characterize the
frequency anisotropy of targets and propose new phase coherence metrics for
multiband processing. Then, we analyze the impact of non-contiguous FR3 bands
considered by 3GPP, and design a new algorithm to mitigate the resulting
sensing artifacts, outperforming existing techniques. Our results represent a
first step toward fully developing multiband ISAC for FR3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G物联网中短码长低延迟密钥生成的需求迫切，但现有源编码方案在短码长下性能显著下降。

Method: 提出多级源PAC编码框架，并结合极化效应和最大似然解码错误系数设计新型码构造算法。

Result: 仿真表明，该方案在短码长下优于传统和多级源极化编码方法，提供更高的密钥生成率。

Conclusion: 多级源PAC编码框架及联合优化的码构造是短码长密钥生成的可行方案。

Abstract: Source polar coding is a potential solution for short blocklength-based
low-latency key generation with limited sources, which is a critical aspect of
six generation (6G) Internet of things. However, existing source coding schemes
still suffer from significant degradation in key generation rate and
reconciliation reliability in short blocklength regime. To address this issue,
we introduce a multilevel source polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC)
coding framework. Furthermore, we propose a novel code construction algorithm
that jointly leverages polarization effects and the maximum likelihood (ML)
decoding error coefficient. Simulations demonstrate that the multilevel source
PAC scheme with the proposed code construction achieves superior key generation
rate under key disagreement constraints compared to conventional and multilevel
source polar coding methods even in short blocklength regimes.

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication is an effective underground emergency
communication technique after disasters such as landslides, mine collapses, and
earthquakes, due to its advantages in mediums such as soil, concrete, and
metals. However, the propagation mediums in practical MI based underground
emergency communications are usually diverse and composed randomly due to the
impact of disasters, which poses a challenge for MI communication in practical
applications. In this paper, we formulate a statistical fading channel model,
which reflects the random composition of diverse mediums and is shown to follow
a lognormal distribution. To mitigate the impact of diverse medium fading,
Multi-frequency Resonating Compensation (MuReC) based coils are used to achieve
multiband transmission. Then, we analyze the performance of MuReC based
multi-band MI communication with diverse medium fading and derive the
expressions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) probability density functions,
ergodic capacities, average bit error rates (BERs), and outage probabilities
for both multiplexing and diversity cases. Numerical results show that MuReC
based multiband transmission schemes can effectively reduce the impact of
diverse medium fading and enhance the performance.

Abstract: The sum of random variables (RVs) appears extensively in wireless
communications, at large, both conventional and advanced, and has been subject
of longstanding research. The statistical characterization of the referred sum
is crucial to determine the performance of such communications systems.
Although efforts have been undertaken to unveil these sum statistics, e.g.,
probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF),
no general efficient nor manageable solutions capable of evaluating the exact
sum PDF and CDF are available to date. The only formulations are given in terms
of either the multi-fold Brennan's integral or the multivariate Fox H-function.
Unfortunately, these methods are only feasible up to a certain number of RVs,
meaning that when the number of RVs in the sum increases, the computation of
the sum PDF and CDF is subject to stability problems, convergence issues, or
inaccurate results. In this paper, we derive new, simple, exact formulations
for the PDF and CDF of the sum of L independent and identically distributed
{\alpha}-{\mu} RVs. Unlike the available solutions, the computational
complexity of our analytical expressions is independent of the number of
summands. Capitalizing on our unprecedented findings, we analyze, in exact and
asymptotic manners, the performance of L-branch pre-detection equal-gain
combining and maximal-ratio combining receivers over {\alpha}-{\mu} fading
environments. The coding and diversity gains of the system for both receivers
are analyzed and quantified. Moreover, numerical simulations show that the
computation time reduces drastically when using our expressions, which are
arguably the most efficient and manageable formulations derived so far.

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的鲁棒波束成形方案能有效提升信道估计误差存在时的通信可靠性和吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该方法为地下应急通信提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication is an effective underground emergency
communication technique after disasters such as landslides, mine collapses, and
earthquakes, due to its advantages in mediums such as soil, concrete, and
metals. Based on channel state information (CSI), magnetic beamforming can
significantly improve the performance of MI communication. However, in
post-disaster underground communication, channel estimation may suffer from
errors due to factors such as complex environmental interferences. Taking
channel estimation error into account, we formulate a beamforming optimization
problem for multi-user MI underground emergency communications, which aims to
minimize the power consumption under the constraints of sum rate and signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of each user. Based on the worst-case
optimization criterion and the S-procedure, the non-convex optimization problem
is transformed into convex and solved. Numerical results show that the proposed
robust beamforming scheme can effectively enhance communication reliability and
effective throughput in the presence of channel estimation errors.

Result: 仿真结果显示，AFDM在非白噪声下性能最佳，增益超过1 dB。

Conclusion: AFDM因其解调矩阵特性在非白噪声环境中优于OTFS和OFDM，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of affine frequency division
multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation
schemes against non-white Gaussian noise, which can model various sources of
additive disturbances to the received signal. The proposed approach
demonstrates that the performance of these waveforms depends on the ability of
the demodulation matrix to whiten the noise-a property that is, in turn,
related to the sparsity of the matrix. AFDM is shown to outperform OTFS and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), as its demodulation matrix
is generally less sparse than those of the other waveforms. Based on this
analysis, several application examples and use cases are presented, such as the
use of AFDM and OTFS in narrowband signals or in coexistence with OFDM signals.
Finally, simulation results confirm that AFDM achieves better performance than
OTFS and OFDM in the presence of non-white noise, with gains exceeding 1 dB in
most application scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入距离率导数，成功扩展了运动目标的运动学参数估计范围，并在性能上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: This letter presents a novel method for estimating the position, velocity,
and acceleration of a moving target using range-based measurements. Although
most existing studies focus on position and velocity estimation, the framework
of this letter is extended to include acceleration. To achieve this, we propose
using the derivative of the range rate, in addition to the range and range rate
measurements. The proposed method estimates the position at first using
Time-of-Arrival (TOA)-based techniques; then, develops a reformulated least
squares (LS) and weighted least squares (WLS) approaches for velocity
estimation; and finally, employs the derivative of the range rate to estimate
the acceleration using previous position and velocity estimates. On the other
hand, closed-form LS and WLS solutions are derived for both velocity and
acceleration. The simulation results show that the proposed approach provides
improved performance in estimating moving target kinematics compared to
existing methods.

TL;DR: CLEAR是一种高效的双阶段定位估计器，融合TDOA和FDOA测量，使用最少传感器（N+1个）定位移动目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式IoT应用中计算资源受限的定位问题，如无人机追踪和智能交通。

Method: 第一阶段引入辅助参数构建伪线性方程，第二阶段通过代数消除和线性优化减少误差。

Result: 仿真显示CLEAR接近CRLB，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLEAR适合资源受限的IoT应用，提供高效准确的定位。

Abstract: This paper presents CLEAR -- a closed-form localization estimator with a
reduced sensor network. The proposed method is a computationally efficient,
two-stage estimator that fuses time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and
frequency-difference-of-arrival (FDOA) measurements with a minimal number of
sensors. CLEAR localizes a moving source in N-dimensional space using only N+1
sensors, achieving the theoretical minimum sensor count. The first stage
introduces auxiliary range and range-rate parameters to construct a set of
pseudo-linear equations, solved via weighted least squares. An algebraic
elimination using Sylvester's resultant then reduces the problem to a quartic
equation, yielding closed-form estimates for the nuisance variables. A second,
lightweight linear refinement stage is applied to mitigate residual bias. Under
mild Gaussian noise assumptions, the estimator's position and velocity
estimates are statistically efficient, closely approaching the Cramer-Rao lower
bound (CRLB). Extensive Monte Carlo simulations in 2-D and 3-D scenarios
demonstrate CRLB-level accuracy and consistent performance gains over
representative two-stage and iterative baselines, confirming the method's high
suitability for power-constrained, distributed Internet of Things (IoT)
applications such as UAV tracking and smart transportation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating multistatic coherent
imaging functionalities in the downlink (DL) of a phase-coherent distributed
multiple input multiple output (D-MIMO) communication network. During DL, the
D-MIMO access points (APs) jointly precode the transmitted signals to maximize
the spectral efficiency (SE) at the users (UEs) locations. However, imaging
requires that \textit{(i)} a fraction of the APs work as receivers for sensing
and \textit{(ii)} the transmitting APs emit AP-specific and orthogonal signals
to illuminate the area to be imaged and allow multistatic operation. In these
settings, our contribution is twofold. We propose a novel distributed
integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC) system that superposes a
purposely designed AP-specific signal for imaging to the legacy UE-specific
communication one, with a tunable trade-off factor. We detail both the imaging
waveform design according to the \textit{extended orthogonality condition} and
the space-frequency precoder design. Then, we propose an optimized selection
strategy for the receiving APs, in order to maximize imaging performance under
half-duplex constraints. Extensive numerical results prove the feasibility and
benefits of our proposal, materializing the potential of joint multistatic
imaging and communications in practical D-MIMO deployments.

Abstract: Accurate channel modeling is essential for realizing the potential of
terahertz (THz) communications in 6G indoor networks, where existing models
struggle with severe frequency selectivity and multipath effects. We propose a
physically grounded Rician fading channel model that jointly incorporates
deterministic line-of-sight (LOS) and stochastic non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
components, enhanced by frequency-dependent attenuation characterized by
optimized exponents alpha and beta. Unlike conventional approaches, our model
integrates a two-ray reflection framework to capture standing wave phenomena
and employs wideband spectral averaging to mitigate frequency selectivity over
bandwidths up to 15 GHz. Empirical measurements at a 208 GHz carrier, spanning
0.1-0.9 m, demonstrate that our model achieves root mean square errors (RMSE)
as low as 2.54 dB, outperforming free-space path loss (FSPL) by up to 14.2% and
reducing RMSE by 73.3% as bandwidth increases. These findings underscore the
importance of bandwidth in suppressing oscillatory artifacts and improving
modeling accuracy. Our approach provides a robust foundation for THz system
design, supporting reliable indoor wireless personal area networks (WPANs),
device-to-device (D2D) communications, and precise localization in future 6G
applications.

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了6G无线网络中多模态数据的泛化能力和数据效率。

Abstract: In 6G wireless networks, multi-modal ML models can be leveraged to enable
situation-aware network decisions in dynamic environments. However, trained ML
models often fail to generalize under domain shifts when training and test data
distributions are different because they often focus on modality-specific
spurious features. In practical wireless systems, domain shifts occur
frequently due to dynamic channel statistics, moving obstacles, or hardware
configuration. Thus, there is a need for learning frameworks that can achieve
robust generalization under scarce multi-modal data in wireless networks. In
this paper, a novel and data-efficient two-phase learning framework is proposed
to improve generalization performance in unseen and unfamiliar wireless
environments with minimal amount of multi-modal data. In the first stage, a
physics-based loss function is employed to enable each BS to learn the physics
underlying its wireless environment captured by multi-modal data. The
data-efficiency of the physics-based loss function is analytically
investigated. In the second stage, collaborative domain adaptation is proposed
to leverage the wireless environment knowledge of multiple BSs to guide
under-performing BSs under domain shift. Specifically, domain-similarity-aware
model aggregation is proposed to utilize the knowledge of BSs that experienced
similar domains. To validate the proposed framework, a new dataset generation
framework is developed by integrating CARLA and MATLAB-based mmWave channel
modeling to predict mmWave RSS. Simulation results show that the proposed
physics-based training requires only 13% of data samples to achieve the same
performance as a state-of-the-art baseline that does not use physics-based
training. Moreover, the proposed collaborative domain adaptation needs only 25%
of data samples and 20% of FLOPs to achieve the convergence compared to
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于忆阻器在写入电导值时的精度问题，影响了向量矩阵乘法的准确性，因此需要一种方法来减小误差。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了计算精度，优于基准方案，尤其在矩阵大小和秩的影响下表现出稳定的误差缩放特性。

Abstract: Memristor crossbars enable vector-matrix multiplication (VMM), and are
promising for low-power applications. However, it can be difficult to write the
memristor conductance values exactly. To improve the accuracy of VMM, we
propose a scheme based on low-rank matrix approximation. Specifically, singular
value decomposition (SVD) is first applied to obtain a low-rank approximation
of the target matrix, which is then factored into a pair of smaller matrices.
Subsequently, a two-step serial VMM is executed, where the stochastic write
errors are mitigated through step-wise averaging. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed scheme, we derive a general expression for the resulting
computation error and provide an asymptotic analysis under a prescribed
singular-value profile, which reveals how the error scales with matrix size and
rank. Both analytical and numerical results confirm the superiority of the
proposed scheme compared with the benchmark scheme.

Abstract: In recent decades Human Body Communication has emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional radio wave communication, utilizing the body's
conductive properties for low-power connectivity among wearables. This method
harnesses the human body as an energy-efficient channel for data transmission
within the electro-quasistatic frequency range, enabling advancements in
human-machine interaction. While prior work has noted the role of parasitic
return paths in such capacitively coupled systems, the influence of surrounding
metallic objects on these paths, which are critical for EQS wireless signaling,
has not been fully explored. This paper fills that gap with a structured study
of how various conducting objects, from non-grounded (floating) metals and
grounded metals to enclosed metallic environments such as elevators and cars,
affect the body-communication channel. We present a theoretical framework
supported by finite element method simulations and experiments with wearable
devices. Results show that metallic objects within 20 cm of devices can reduce
transmission loss by about 10 dB. When a device ground connects to a grounded
metallic object, channel gain can increase by at least 20 dB. Contact area
during touch-based interactions with grounded metals produces contact-impedance
dependent high-pass channel characteristics. Proximity to metallic objects
introduces variability within a critical distance, with grounded metals
producing a larger overall effect than floating metals. These findings improve
understanding of body-centric communication links and inform design for
healthcare, consumer electronics, defense, and industrial applications.

Abstract: The commencement of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks represents a
fundamental shift in the integration of communication and sensing technologies
to support next-generation applications. Integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) is a key concept in this evolution, enabling end-to-end support for both

deployment. The paper further analyzes current research directions to highlight
key challenges, open issues, and emerging trends. Design insights and

implementation. This work ultimately try to address three central questions:
Why is ISAC essential for 6G? What innovations does it bring? How will it shape
the future of wireless communication?

Conclusion: 该策略通过协同缓存和动态链路探测调度，有效解决了卫星-地面混合网络的吞吐量优化问题。

Abstract: Caching is crucial in hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks to reduce
latency, optimize throughput, and improve data availability by storing
frequently accessed content closer to users, especially in bandwidth-limited
satellite systems, requiring strategic Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. This
paper addresses throughput optimization in satellite-terrestrial integrated
networks through opportunistic cooperative caching. We propose a joint probing
and scheduling strategy to enhance content retrieval efficiency. The strategy
leverages the LEO satellite to probe satellite-to-ground links and cache states
of multiple cooperative terrestrial stations, enabling dynamic user scheduling
for content delivery. Using an optimal stopping theoretic approach with two
levels of incomplete information, we make real-time decisions on
satellite-terrestrial hybrid links and caching probing. Our threshold-based
strategy optimizes probing and scheduling, significantly improving average
system throughput by exploiting cooperative caching, satellite-terrestrial link
transmission, and time diversity from dynamic user requests. Simulation results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed strategies.

Abstract: Holographic MIMO (HMIMO) has emerged as a promising solution for future
wireless systems by enabling ultra-dense, spatially continuous antenna
deployments. While prior studies have primarily focused on electromagnetic (EM)
modeling or simulation-based performance analysis, a rigorous
communication-theoretic framework remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents the first analytical performance study of a multi-user HMIMO downlink
system with matched filter (MF) precoding - a low-complexity baseline scheme.
By incorporating multipath propagation, mutual coupling, and element
excitation, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the MF
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) using an equivalent random
variable model. Leveraging bivariate gamma distributions, we then develop
tractable throughput approximations under full, partial, and no channel state
information (CSI) scenarios. Additionally, we formulate a max-min beamforming
problem to benchmark optimal user fairness performance. Numerical results
validate the accuracy of the proposed framework and reveal that MF precoding
achieves competitive performance with strong robustness to low SINR and CSI
uncertainty.

Abstract: Networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained significant
attention as a promising technology for enabling next-generation wireless
systems. To further enhance networked ISAC, delegating the reception of sensing
signals to dedicated target monitoring terminals (TMTs) instead of base
stations (BSs) offers significant advantages in terms of sensing capability and
deployment flexibility. Despite its potential, the coordinated beamforming
design for networked integrated communication and time-of-arrival (ToA)-based
multi-TMT localization remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive study to fill this gap. Specifically, we first establish signal
models for both communication and localization, and, for the first time, derive
a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize the localization
performance. Subsequently, we exploit this CRLB to formulate two optimization
problems, focusing on sensing-centric and communication-centric criteria,
respectively. For the sensing-centric problem, we develop a globally optimal
algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) when each BS is equipped with
more antennas than the total number of communication users. While for the
communication-centric problem, we design a globally optimal algorithm for the
single-BS case using bisection search. For the general case of both problems,
we propose a unified successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm,
which is suboptimal yet efficient, and further extend it from single-target
scenarios to more practical multi-target scenarios. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, reveal the intrinsic
performance trade-offs between communication and localization, and further show
that deploying more TMTs is always preferable to deploying more BSs in
networked ISAC systems.

Result: DEP方法资源需求减半，实数序列有界且易于量化，数值结果展示了其在无线通信中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: DEP方法有效降低了存储和传输酉矩阵的资源需求，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Unitary matrices are the basis of a large number of signal processing
applications. In many of these applications, finding ways to efficiently store,
and even transmit these matrices, can significantly reduce memory and
throughput requirements. In this work, we study the problem of efficient
transmission and storage of unitary matrices. Specifically, we explicitly
derive a dimensionally-efficient parametrization (DEP) for unitary matrices
that allows identifying them with sequences of real numbers, where the
dimension coincides with the dimension of the unitary group where they lie. We
also characterize its inverse map that allows retrieving the original unitary
matrices from their DEP. The proposed approach effectively allows halving the
dimension with respect to naively considering all the entries of each unitary
matrix, thus reducing the resources required to store and transmit these
matrices. Furthermore, we show that the sequence of real numbers associated to
the proposed DEP is bounded, and we delimit the interval where these numbers
are contained, facilitating the implementation of quantization approaches with
limited distortion. On the other hand, we outline ways to further reduce the
dimension of the DEP when considering more restrictive constraints for matrices
that show up in certain applications. The numerical results showcase the
potential of the proposed approach in general settings, as well as in three
specific applications of current interest for wireless communications research.

Abstract: In this work, we study a multi-user NTN in which a satellite serves as the
primary network and a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) operates as the
secondary network, acting as a cognitive radio. To reduce the cost, complexity,
and power consumption of conventional antenna arrays, we equip the HAPS with a
transmissive BD-RIS antenna front end. We then formulate a joint optimization
problem for the BD-RIS phase response and the HAPS transmit power allocation
under strict per-user interference temperature constraints. To tackle the
resulting highly nonconvex problem, we propose an alternating-optimization
framework: the power-allocation subproblem admits a closed-form,
water-filling-type solution derived from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions, while the BD-RIS configuration is refined via Riemannian manifold
optimization. Simulation results show significant gains in data rate and
interference suppression over diagonal RIS-assisted benchmarks, establishing
BD-RIS as a promising enabler for future multilayer NTNs.

Abstract: One of the main challenges facing Internet of Things (IoT) networks is
managing interference caused by the large number of devices communicating
simultaneously, particularly in multi-cluster networks where multiple devices
simultaneously transmit to their respective receiver. Over-the-Air Computation
(AirComp) has emerged as a promising solution for efficient real-time data
aggregation, yet its performance suffers in dense, interference-limited

scheme tailored for up-link AirComp systems. Unlike previous approaches, the
proposed method scales to an arbitrary number $\sf K$ of clusters and enables
each cluster to exploit half of the available channels, instead of only
$\tfrac{1}{\sf K}$ as in time-sharing. In addition, we develop schemes tailored
to scenarios where users are shared between adjacent clusters.

Abstract: In every imaging or sensing application, the physical hardware creates
constraints that must be overcome or they limit system performance. Techniques
that leverage additional degrees of freedom can effectively extend performance
beyond the inherent physical capabilities of the hardware. An example includes
synchronizing distributed sensors so as to synthesize a larger aperture for
remote sensing applications. An additional example is integrating the
communication and sensing functions in a wireless system through the clever
design of waveforms and optimized resource management. As these technologies
mature beyond the conceptual and prototype phase they will ultimately
transition to the commercial market. Here, standards play a critical role in
ensuring success. Standards ensure interoperability between systems
manufactured by different vendors and define industry best practices for
vendors and customers alike. The Signal Processing Society of the Institute for
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) plays a leading role in developing
high-quality standards for computational sensing technologies through the
working groups of the Synthetic Aperture Standards Committee (SASC). In this
column we highlight the standards activities of the P3383 Performance Metrics

Conclusion: 研究为非渐近、易计算的稳态偏离提供了保证，适用于任何拉普拉斯平滑和线性扩散的场景。

Abstract: We study how far a diffusion process on a graph can drift from a designed
starting pattern when that pattern is produced using Laplacian regularisation.
Under standard stability conditions for undirected, entrywise nonnegative
graphs, we give a closed-form, instance-specific upper bound on the
steady-state spread, measured as the relative change between the final and
initial profiles. The bound separates two effects: (i) an irreducible term
determined by the graph's maximum node degree, and (ii) a design-controlled
term that shrinks as the regularisation strength increases (following an
inverse square-root law). This leads to a simple design rule: given any target
limit on spread, one can choose a sufficient regularisation strength in closed
form. Although one motivating application is array beamforming, where the
initial pattern is the squared magnitude of the beamformer weights, the result
applies to any scenario that first enforces Laplacian smoothness and then
evolves by linear diffusion on a graph. Overall, the guarantee is
non-asymptotic, easy to compute, and certifies how much steady-state deviation
can occur.

Abstract: General-purpose robots need a deep understanding of the physical world,
advanced reasoning, and general and dexterous control. This report introduces
the latest generation of the Gemini Robotics model family: Gemini Robotics 1.5,
a multi-embodiment Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, and Gemini Robotics-ER
1.5, a state-of-the-art Embodied Reasoning (ER) model. We are bringing together
three major innovations. First, Gemini Robotics 1.5 features a novel
architecture and a Motion Transfer (MT) mechanism, which enables it to learn
from heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data and makes the VLA more general.
Second, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal
reasoning process in natural language. This enables the robot to "think before
acting" and notably improves its ability to decompose and execute complex,
multi-step tasks, and also makes the robot's behavior more interpretable to the
user. Third, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 establishes a new state-of-the-art for
embodied reasoning, i.e., for reasoning capabilities that are critical for
robots, such as visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress
estimation. Together, this family of models takes us a step towards an era of
physical agents-enabling robots to perceive, think and then act so they can
solve complex multi-step tasks.

Abstract: Elongate animals and robots use undulatory body waves to locomote through
diverse environments. Geometric mechanics provides a framework to model and
optimize such systems in highly damped environments, connecting a prescribed
shape change pattern (gait) with locomotion displacement. However, existing
approaches assume precise execution of prescribed gaits, whereas in practice
environmental interactions with compliant bodies of animals or robots
frequently perturb the realized trajectories. In this work, we extend geometric
mechanics to predict locomotor performance and search for optimal swimming
strategy of compliant undulators. We introduce a compliant extension of
Purcell's three-link swimmer by incorporating series-connected springs at the
joints. Body dynamics are derived with resistive force theory. Geometric
mechanics is incorporated into movement prediction and into an optimization
framework that identifies strategies for controlling compliant swimmers to
achieve maximal displacement. We validate our framework on a physical
cable-driven three-link limbless robot, and demonstrate accurate prediction and
optimization of locomotor performance under varied programmed, state-dependent
compliance in a granular medium. Our results establish a systematic
physics-based approach for modeling and controlling compliant swimming
locomotion, highlighting compliance as a design feature that can be exploited
for robust movement in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于学习的运动规划方法，通过Flow Matching模型直接从单视图点云生成优化的初始轨迹，解决了传统优化方法易陷入局部最优的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在HRC系统中，机器人需实时响应动态环境，而现有采样和优化方法在效率和初始化敏感度上存在不足。

Method: 采用Flow Matching模型，基于单视图点云学习生成优化的初始轨迹，无需先验环境知识。

Result: 仿真实验表明，该方法显著提高了轨迹优化的成功率，减少了迭代次数，并展现出对新环境的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效、高成功率的机器人运动规划提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Rapid robot motion generation is critical in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
systems, as robots need to respond to dynamic environments in real time by
continuously observing their surroundings and replanning their motions to
ensure both safe interactions and efficient task execution. Current
sampling-based motion planners face challenges in scaling to high-dimensional
configuration spaces and often require post-processing to interpolate and
smooth the generated paths, resulting in time inefficiency in complex
environments. Optimization-based planners, on the other hand, can incorporate
multiple constraints and generate smooth trajectories directly, making them
potentially more time-efficient. However, optimization-based planners are
sensitive to initialization and may get stuck in local minima. In this work, we
present a novel learning-based method that utilizes a Flow Matching model
conditioned on a single-view point cloud to learn near-optimal solutions for
optimization initialization. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the
environment, such as obstacle locations and geometries, and can generate
feasible trajectories directly from single-view depth camera input. Simulation
studies on a UR5e robotic manipulator in cluttered workspaces demonstrate that
the proposed generative initializer achieves a high success rate on its own,
significantly improves the success rate of trajectory optimization compared
with traditional and learning-based benchmark initializers, requires fewer
optimization iterations, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen
environments.

Abstract: Robust adaptive control methods are essential for maintaining quadcopter
performance under external disturbances and model uncertainties. However,
fragmented evaluations across tasks, simulators, and implementations hinder
systematic comparison of these methods. This paper introduces an
easy-to-deploy, modular simulation testbed for quadcopter control, built on
RotorPy, that enables evaluation under a wide range of disturbances such as
wind, payload shifts, rotor faults, and control latency. The framework includes
a library of representative adaptive and non-adaptive controllers and provides
task-relevant metrics to assess tracking accuracy and robustness. The unified
modular environment enables reproducible evaluation across control methods and
eliminates redundant reimplementation of components such as disturbance models,
trajectory generators, and analysis tools. We illustrate the testbed's
versatility through examples spanning multiple disturbance scenarios and
trajectory types, including automated stress testing, to demonstrate its
utility for systematic analysis. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究动机是解决机器人分拣系统中目的地到滑槽任务映射的优化问题，以提高吞吐量，并应对滑槽关闭和下游处理的挑战。

Method: 方法包括正式定义任务映射和任务映射优化问题，开发RSS模拟器进行评价，以及提出基于进化算法和混合整数线性规划的优化方法。

Conclusion: 结论是通过优化任务映射可以显著提高机器人分拣系统的吞吐量，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study optimizing a destination-to-chutes task mapping to improve
throughput in Robotic Sorting Systems (RSS), where a team of robots sort
packages on a sortation floor by transporting them from induct workstations to
eject chutes based on their shipping destinations (e.g. Los Angeles or
Pittsburgh). The destination-to-chutes task mapping is used to determine which
chutes a robot can drop its package. Finding a high-quality task mapping is
challenging because of the complexity of a real-world RSS. First, optimizing
task mapping is interdependent with robot target assignment and path planning.
Second, chutes will be CLOSED for a period of time once they receive sufficient
packages to allow for downstream processing. Third, task mapping quality
directly impacts the downstream processing, as scattered chutes for the same
destination increase package handling time. In this paper, we first formally
define task mappings and the problem of Task Mapping Optimization (TMO). We
then present a simulator of RSS to evaluate task mappings. We then present a
simple TMO method based on the Evolutionary Algorithm and Mixed Integer Linear
Programming, demonstrating the advantage of our optimized task mappings over
the greedily generated ones in various RSS setups with different map sizes,
numbers of chutes, and destinations. Finally, we use Quality Diversity
algorithms to analyze the throughput of a diverse set of task mappings. Our
code is available online at https://github.com/lunjohnzhang/tmo_public.

### [35] [Robust Permissive Controller Synthesis for Interval MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03481)
*Khang Vo Huynh,David Parker,Lu Feng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于IMDP的鲁棒容忍控制器合成框架，首次解决了不确定动态下的多策略合成问题，并通过MILP方法实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对机器人操作中的不确定动态（IMDP建模），传统确定性策略缺乏灵活性，而现有容忍控制器方法未考虑概率不确定性，限制了实用性。

Method: 将问题转化为混合整数线性规划（MILP），提出两种编码方法：基线顶点枚举法和可扩展的对偶法。

Result: 实验显示，两种方法均能合成鲁棒且最大化容忍的控制器，并可扩展至数十万状态的大型IMDP。

Conclusion: 该框架首次在IMDP上实现鲁棒容忍控制器合成，填补了理论与实际应用的鸿沟，具备高效性与可扩展性。

Abstract: We address the problem of robust permissive controller synthesis for robots
operating under uncertain dynamics, modeled as Interval Markov Decision
Processes (IMDPs). IMDPs generalize standard MDPs by allowing transition
probabilities to vary within intervals, capturing epistemic uncertainty from
sensing noise, actuation imprecision, and coarse system abstractions-common in
robotics. Traditional controller synthesis typically yields a single
deterministic strategy, limiting adaptability. In contrast, permissive
controllers (multi-strategies) allow multiple actions per state, enabling
runtime flexibility and resilience. However, prior work on permissive
controller synthesis generally assumes exact transition probabilities, which is
unrealistic in many robotic applications. We present the first framework for
robust permissive controller synthesis on IMDPs, guaranteeing that all
strategies compliant with the synthesized multi-strategy satisfy reachability
or reward-based specifications under all admissible transitions. We formulate
the problem as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and propose two encodings:
a baseline vertex-enumeration method and a scalable duality-based method that
avoids explicit enumeration. Experiments on four benchmark domains show that
both methods synthesize robust, maximally permissive controllers and scale to
large IMDPs with up to hundreds of thousands of states.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于预测的安全规划框架，通过数字孪生验证实现人类运动的精确预测和主动避碰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类与机器人协作需要精确预测人类运动以避免碰撞，现有规划器仅依赖运动学模型，难以满足主动避碰的需求。

Method: 结合CNN-BiLSTM模型预测关节轨迹，利用胶囊人工势场（APF）计算碰撞风险，触发自适应RRT*规划器，并通过数字孪生实时验证。

Result: 在50次试验中，该方法实现了100%的主动避碰，碰撞距离大于250毫米，且重新规划时间低于2秒。

Conclusion: 结合预测模型和数字孪生验证的方法在精度和可靠性上优于仅依赖运动学的规划器。

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration requires precise prediction of human motion over
extended horizons to enable proactive collision avoidance. Unlike existing
planners that rely solely on kinodynamic models, we present a prediction-driven
safe planning framework that leverages granular, joint-by-joint human motion
forecasting validated in a physics-based digital twin. A capsule-based
artificial potential field (APF) converts these granular predictions into
collision risk metrics, triggering an Adaptive RRT* (A-RRT*) planner when
thresholds are exceeded. The depth camera is used to extract 3D skeletal poses
and a convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory
(CNN-BiLSTM) model to predict individual joint trajectories ahead of time. A
digital twin model integrates real-time human posture prediction placed in
front of a simulated robot to evaluate motions and physical contacts. The
proposed method enables validation of planned trajectories ahead of time and
bridging potential latency gaps in updating planned trajectories in real-time.
In 50 trials, our method achieved 100% proactive avoidance with > 250 mm
clearance and sub-2 s replanning, demonstrating superior precision and
reliability compared to existing kinematic-only planners through the
integration of predictive human modeling with digital twin validation.

Conclusion: 提出的MPC-CLF-CBF框架在多机器人导航中表现出高效鲁棒性，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Maintaining connectivity is crucial in many multi-robot applications, yet
fragile to obstacles and visual occlusions. We present a real-time distributed
framework for multi-robot navigation certified by high-order control barrier
functions (HOCBFs) that controls inter-robot proximity to maintain connectivity
while avoiding collisions. We incorporate control Lyapunov functions to enable
connectivity recovery from initial disconnected configurations and temporary
losses, providing robust connectivity during navigation in obstacle-rich
environments. Our trajectory generation framework concurrently produces
planning and control through a Bezier-parameterized trajectory, which naturally
provides smooth curves with arbitrary degree of derivatives. The main
contribution is the unified MPC-CLF-CBF framework, a continuous-time trajectory
generation and control method for connectivity maintenance and recovery of
multi-robot systems. We validate the framework through extensive simulations
and a physical experiment with 4 Crazyflie nano-quadrotors.

Conclusion: LapSurgie为手术机器人系统在资源匮乏地区的部署提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Robotic laparoscopic surgery has gained increasing attention in recent years
for its potential to deliver more efficient and precise minimally invasive
procedures. However, adoption of surgical robotic platforms remains largely
confined to high-resource medical centers, exacerbating healthcare disparities
in rural and low-resource regions. To close this gap, a range of solutions has
been explored, from remote mentorship to fully remote telesurgery. Yet, the
practical deployment of surgical robotic systems to underserved communities
remains an unsolved challenge. Humanoid systems offer a promising path toward
deployability, as they can directly operate in environments designed for humans
without extensive infrastructure modifications -- including operating rooms. In
this work, we introduce LapSurgie, the first humanoid-robot-based laparoscopic
teleoperation framework. The system leverages an inverse-mapping strategy for
manual-wristed laparoscopic instruments that abides to remote center-of-motion
constraints, enabling precise hand-to-tool control of off-the-shelf surgical
laparoscopic tools without additional setup requirements. A control console
equipped with a stereo vision system provides real-time visual feedback.
Finally, a comprehensive user study across platforms demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed framework and provides initial evidence for the
feasibility of deploying humanoid robots in laparoscopic procedures.

Result: 在特征检测和位姿估计方面表现优异，速度快且在手术环境中达到最新精度。

Conclusion: 该框架在挑战性环境中实现了高效且高精度的相机-机器人标定。

Abstract: Accurate camera-to-robot calibration is essential for any vision-based
robotic control system and especially critical in minimally invasive surgical
robots, where instruments conduct precise micro-manipulations. However, MIS
robots have long kinematic chains and partial visibility of their degrees of
freedom in the camera, which introduces challenges for conventional
camera-to-robot calibration methods that assume stiff robots with good
visibility. Previous works have investigated both keypoint-based and
rendering-based approaches to address this challenge in real-world conditions;
however, they often struggle with consistent feature detection or have long
inference times, neither of which are ideal for online robot control. In this
work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the detection of geometric
primitives (keypoints and shaft edges) through a shared encoding, enabling
efficient pose estimation via projection geometry. This architecture detects
both keypoints and edges in a single inference and is trained on large-scale
synthetic data with projective labeling. This method is evaluated across both
feature detection and pose estimation, with qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrating fast performance and state-of-the-art accuracy in
challenging surgical environments.

Abstract: Soft robots, inspired by elephant trunks or octopus arms, offer extraordinary
flexibility to bend, twist, and elongate in ways that rigid robots cannot.
However, their motion planning remains a challenge, especially in cluttered
environments with obstacles, due to their highly nonlinear and
infinite-dimensional kinematics. Here, we present a graph-based path planning
tool for an elephant-trunk-inspired soft robotic arm designed with three
artificial muscle fibers that allow for multimodal continuous deformation
through contraction. Using a biomechanical model inspired by morphoelasticity
and active filament theory, we precompute a shape library and construct a
$k$-nearest neighbor graph in \emph{shape space}, ensuring that each node
corresponds to a mechanically accurate and physically valid robot shape. For
the graph, we use signed distance functions to prune nodes and edges colliding
with obstacles, and define multi-objective edge costs based on geometric
distance and actuation effort, enabling energy-efficient planning with
collision avoidance. We demonstrate that our algorithm reliably avoids
obstacles and generates feasible paths within milliseconds from precomputed
graphs using Dijkstra's algorithm. We show that including energy costs can
drastically reduce the actuation effort compared to geometry-only planning, at
the expense of longer tip trajectories. Our results highlight the potential of
shape-space graph search for fast and reliable path planning in the field of
soft robotics, paving the way for real-time applications in surgical,
industrial, and assistive settings.

Conclusion: 接触显式策略学习显著提升了对未见场景的泛化能力，为可扩展的联合运动与操作奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present a unified framework for multi-task locomotion and manipulation
policy learning grounded in a contact-explicit representation. Instead of
designing different policies for different tasks, our approach unifies the
definition of a task through a sequence of contact goals-desired contact
positions, timings, and active end-effectors. This enables leveraging the
shared structure across diverse contact-rich tasks, leading to a single policy
that can perform a wide range of tasks. In particular, we train a
goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) policy to realise given contact
plans. We validate our framework on multiple robotic embodiments and tasks: a
quadruped performing multiple gaits, a humanoid performing multiple biped and
quadrupedal gaits, and a humanoid executing different bimanual object
manipulation tasks. Each of these scenarios is controlled by a single policy
trained to execute different tasks grounded in contacts, demonstrating
versatile and robust behaviours across morphologically distinct systems. Our
results show that explicit contact reasoning significantly improves
generalisation to unseen scenarios, positioning contact-explicit policy
learning as a promising foundation for scalable loco-manipulation.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous vehicles necessitates advanced path planning
and obstacle avoidance capabilities, particularly in dynamic environments. This
paper introduces a bi-level control framework that efficiently augments road
boundaries by incorporating time-dependent grid projections of obstacle
movements, thus enabling precise and adaptive path planning. The main control
loop utilizes Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for real-time path
optimization, wherein homotopy-based constraint relaxation is employed to
improve the solvability of the optimal control problem (OCP). Furthermore, an
independent backup loop runs concurrently to provide safe fallback trajectories
when an optimal trajectory cannot be computed by the main loop within a
critical time frame, thus enhancing safety and real-time performance. Our
evaluation showcases the benefits of the proposed methods in various driving
scenarios, highlighting the real-time applicability and robustness of our
approach. Overall, the framework represents a significant step towards safer
and more reliable autonomous driving in complex and dynamic environments.

Result: 模型在模拟壳结构时避免了奇异性和锁定现象，并通过实验验证了其在严重旋转和位移情况下的有效性。

Conclusion: 新模型为磁性软壳结构的分析和控制提供了高效工具，尤其在形变剧烈时表现优异。

Abstract: Cosserat rod theory is the popular approach to modeling ferromagnetic soft
robots as 1-Dimensional (1D) slender structures in most applications, such as
biomedical. However, recent soft robots designed for locomotion and
manipulation often exhibit a large width-to-length ratio that categorizes them
as 2D shells. For analysis and shape-morphing control purposes, we develop an
efficient coordinate-free static model of hard-magnetic shells found in soft
magnetic grippers and walking soft robots. The approach is based on a novel
formulation of Cosserat shell theory on the Special Euclidean group
($\mathbf{SE}(3)$). The shell is assumed to be a 2D manifold of material points
with six degrees of freedom (position & rotation) suitable for capturing the
behavior of a uniformly distributed array of spheroidal hard magnetic particles
embedded in the rheological elastomer. The shell's configuration manifold is
the space of all smooth embeddings $\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbf{SE}(3)$.
According to a novel definition of local deformation gradient based on the Lie
group structure of $\mathbf{SE}(3)$, we derive the strong and weak forms of
equilibrium equations, following the principle of virtual work. We extract the
linearized version of the weak form for numerical implementations. The
resulting finite element approach can avoid well-known challenges such as
singularity and locking phenomenon in modeling shell structures. The proposed
model is analytically and experimentally validated through a series of test
cases that demonstrate its superior efficacy, particularly when the shell
undergoes severe rotations and displacements.

infrastructure. The robot's dynamic performance and locomotion capabilities are
systematically validated through experimental characterization.

Abstract: Robots with internal visual self-models promise unprecedented adaptability,
yet existing autonomous modeling pipelines remain fragile under realistic
sensing conditions such as noisy imagery and cluttered backgrounds. This paper
presents the first systematic study quantifying how visual
degradations--including blur, salt-and-pepper noise, and Gaussian noise--affect
robotic self-modeling. Through both simulation and physical experiments, we
demonstrate their impact on morphology prediction, trajectory planning, and
damage recovery in state-of-the-art pipelines. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce a task-aware denoising framework that couples classical restoration
with morphology-preserving constraints, ensuring retention of structural cues
critical for self-modeling. In addition, we integrate semantic segmentation to
robustly isolate robots from cluttered and colorful scenes. Extensive
experiments show that our approach restores near-baseline performance across
simulated and physical platforms, while existing pipelines degrade
significantly. These contributions advance the robustness of visual
self-modeling and establish practical foundations for deploying self-aware
robots in unpredictable real-world environments.

Abstract: Data-driven planar pushing methods have recently gained attention as they
reduce manual engineering effort and improve generalization compared to
analytical approaches. However, most prior work targets narrow capabilities
(e.g., side switching, precision, or single-task training), limiting broader
applicability. We present a model-based framework for non-prehensile tabletop
pushing that uses a single learned model to address multiple tasks without
retraining. Our approach employs a recurrent GRU-based architecture with
additional non-linear layers to capture object-environment dynamics while
ensuring stability. A tailored state-action representation enables the model to
generalize across uncertain dynamics, variable push lengths, and diverse tasks.
For control, we integrate the learned dynamics with a sampling-based Model
Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller, which generates adaptive,
task-oriented actions. This framework supports side switching, variable-length
pushes, and objectives such as precise positioning, trajectory following, and
obstacle avoidance. Training is performed in simulation with domain
randomization to support sim-to-real transfer. We first evaluate the
architecture through ablation studies, showing improved prediction accuracy and
stable rollouts. We then validate the full system in simulation and real-world
experiments using a Franka Panda robot with markerless tracking. Results
demonstrate high success rates in precise positioning under strict thresholds
and strong performance in trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance. Moreover,
multiple tasks are solved simply by changing the controller's objective
function, without retraining. While our current focus is on a single object
type, we extend the framework by training on wider push lengths and designing a
balanced controller that reduces the number of steps for longer-horizon goals.

Conclusion: 在数据有限或不平衡的环境下，基于模式的方法可能比深度学习方法更适用，这为机器人在新环境中的冷启动提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Robots and other intelligent systems navigating in complex dynamic
environments should predict future actions and intentions of surrounding agents
to reach their goals efficiently and avoid collisions. The dynamics of those
agents strongly depends on their tasks, roles, or observable labels.
Class-conditioned motion prediction is thus an appealing way to reduce forecast
uncertainty and get more accurate predictions for heterogeneous agents.
However, this is hardly explored in the prior art, especially for mobile robots
and in limited data applications. In this paper, we analyse different
class-conditioned trajectory prediction methods on two datasets. We propose a
set of conditional pattern-based and efficient deep learning-based baselines,
and evaluate their performance on robotics and outdoors datasets (TH\"OR-MAGNI
and Stanford Drone Dataset). Our experiments show that all methods improve
accuracy in most of the settings when considering class labels. More
importantly, we observe that there are significant differences when learning
from imbalanced datasets, or in new environments where sufficient data is not
available. In particular, we find that deep learning methods perform better on
balanced datasets, but in applications with limited data, e.g., cold start of a
robot in a new environment, or imbalanced classes, pattern-based methods may be
preferable.

Conclusion: COVER为半静态环境提供了一种高效的固定时间运动规划解决方案。

Abstract: Having the ability to answer motion-planning queries within a fixed time
budget is critical for the widespread deployment of robotic systems.
Semi-static environments, where most obstacles remain static but a limited set
can vary across queries, exhibit structured variability that can be
systematically exploited to provide stronger guarantees than in general
motion-planning problems. However, prior approaches in this setting either lack
formal guarantees or rely on restrictive discretizations of obstacle
configurations, limiting their applicability in realistic domains. This paper
introduces COVER, a novel framework that incrementally constructs a
coverage-verified roadmap in semi-static environments. By partitioning the
obstacle configuration space and solving for feasible paths within each
partition, COVER systematically verifies feasibility of the roadmap in each
partition and guarantees fixed-time motion planning queries within the verified
regions. We validate COVER with a 7-DOF simulated Panda robot performing table
and shelf tasks, demonstrating that COVER achieves broader coverage with higher
query success rates than prior works.

Conclusion: SBP证明了3D潜在地图在移动操作任务中的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that mobile manipulation policies utilizing a
3D latent map achieve stronger spatial and temporal reasoning than policies
relying solely on images. We introduce Seeing the Bigger Picture (SBP), an
end-to-end policy learning approach that operates directly on a 3D map of
latent features. In SBP, the map extends perception beyond the robot's current
field of view and aggregates observations over long horizons. Our mapping
approach incrementally fuses multiview observations into a grid of
scene-specific latent features. A pre-trained, scene-agnostic decoder
reconstructs target embeddings from these features and enables online
optimization of the map features during task execution. A policy, trainable
with behavior cloning or reinforcement learning, treats the latent map as a
state variable and uses global context from the map obtained via a 3D feature
aggregator. We evaluate SBP on scene-level mobile manipulation and sequential
tabletop manipulation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that SBP (i) reasons
globally over the scene, (ii) leverages the map as long-horizon memory, and
(iii) outperforms image-based policies in both in-distribution and novel
scenes, e.g., improving the success rate by 25% for the sequential manipulation
task.

Result: 在多任务评估中超越基线pi0，节省计算资源且无需额外摄像头，保持语言能力。

Conclusion: NoTVLA在性能、泛化与资源效率上均优于传统方法，适合多平台部署。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied
intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment,
most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance
on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create
isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle
these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA)
framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories,
thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory
fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning
strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages
temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot
end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these
sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that
delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot.
In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and
generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints:
it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires
no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy
closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also
preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot
generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment
across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even
when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.

Abstract: Millions of people around the world need assistance with feeding. Robotic
feeding systems offer the potential to enhance autonomy and quality of life for
individuals with impairments and reduce caregiver workload. However, their
widespread adoption has been limited by technical challenges such as estimating
bite timing, the appropriate moment for the robot to transfer food to a user's
mouth. In this work, we introduce WAFFLE: Wearable Approach For Feeding with
LEarned bite timing, a system that accurately predicts bite timing by
leveraging wearable sensor data to be highly reactive to natural user cues such
as head movements, chewing, and talking. We train a supervised regression model
on bite timing data from 14 participants and incorporate a user-adjustable
assertiveness threshold to convert predictions into proceed or stop commands.
In a study with 15 participants without motor impairments with the Obi feeding
robot, WAFFLE performs statistically on par with or better than baseline
methods across measures of feeling of control, robot understanding, and
workload, and is preferred by the majority of participants for both individual
and social dining. We further demonstrate WAFFLE's generalizability in a study
with 2 participants with motor impairments in their home environments using a
Kinova 7DOF robot. Our findings support WAFFLE's effectiveness in enabling
natural, reactive bite timing that generalizes across users, robot hardware,
robot positioning, feeding trajectories, foods, and both individual and social
dining contexts.

Conclusion: TCB-VIO通过FPSP的高帧率特性有效减少了时空漂移问题，为视觉惯性里程计提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision algorithms can be executed directly on the image sensor when
implemented on the next-generation sensors known as focal-plane
sensor-processor arrays (FPSP)s, where every pixel has a processor. FPSPs
greatly improve latency, reducing the problems associated with the bottleneck
of data transfer from a vision sensor to a processor. FPSPs accelerate
vision-based algorithms such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO). However, VIO
frameworks suffer from spatial drift due to the vision-based pose estimation,
whilst temporal drift arises from the inertial measurements. FPSPs circumvent
the spatial drift by operating at a high frame rate to match the high-frequency
output of the inertial measurements. In this paper, we present TCB-VIO, a
tightly-coupled 6 degrees-of-freedom VIO by a Multi-State Constraint Kalman
Filter (MSCKF), operating at a high frame-rate of 250 FPS and from IMU
measurements obtained at 400 Hz. TCB-VIO outperforms state-of-the-art methods:

Abstract: Off-road environments present unique challenges for autonomous navigation due
to their complex and unstructured nature. Traditional global path-planning
methods, which typically aim to minimize path length and travel time, perform
poorly on large-scale maps and fail to account for critical factors such as
real-time performance, kinematic feasibility, and memory efficiency. This paper
introduces a novel global path-planning method specifically designed for
off-road environments, addressing these essential factors. The method begins by
constructing an intermediate map within the pixel coordinate system,
incorporating geographical features like off-road trails, waterways, restricted
and passable areas, and trees. The planning problem is then divided into three
sub-problems: graph-based path planning, kinematic feasibility checking, and
path smoothing. This approach effectively meets real-time performance
requirements while ensuring kinematic feasibility and efficient memory use. The
method was tested in various off-road environments with large-scale maps up to
several square kilometers in size, successfully identifying feasible paths in
an average of 1.5 seconds and utilizing approximately 1.5GB of memory under
extreme conditions. The proposed framework is versatile and applicable to a
wide range of off-road autonomous navigation tasks, including search and rescue
missions and agricultural operations.

Abstract: Learning robust robotic control policies remains a major challenge due to the
high cost of collecting labeled data, limited generalization to unseen
environments, and difficulties in planning over long horizons. While
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a promising solution by grounding
natural language instructions into single-step control commands, they often
lack mechanisms for lookahead and struggle with compounding errors in dynamic
tasks. In this project, we introduce Scaling Inference-Time COMpute for VLAs
(SITCOM), a framework that augments any pretrained VLA with model-based
rollouts and reward-based trajectory selection, inspired by Model Predictive
Control algorithm. SITCOM leverages a learned dynamics model to simulate
multi-step action rollouts to select the best candidate plan for real-world
execution, transforming one-shot VLAs into robust long-horizon planners. We
develop an efficient transformer-based dynamics model trained on large-scale
BridgeV2 data and fine-tuned on SIMPLER environments to bridge the Real2Sim
gap, and score candidate rollouts using rewards from simulator. Through
comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks and settings in the SIMPLER
environment, we demonstrate that SITCOM when combined with a good reward
function can significantly improve task completion rate from 48% to 72% using
trained dynamics model.

Abstract: Autonomous surgical systems must adapt to highly dynamic environments where
tissue properties and visual cues evolve rapidly. Central to such adaptability
is feedback: the ability to sense, interpret, and respond to changes during
execution. While feedback mechanisms have been explored in surgical robotics,
ranging from tool and tissue tracking to error detection, existing methods
remain limited in handling the topological and perceptual challenges of tissue
dissection. In this work, we propose a feedback-enabled framework for
autonomous tissue dissection that explicitly reasons about topological changes
from endoscopic images after each dissection action. This structured feedback
guides subsequent actions, enabling the system to localize dissection progress
and adapt policies online. To improve the reliability of such feedback, we
introduce visibility metrics that quantify tissue exposure and formulate
optimal controller designs that actively manipulate tissue to maximize
visibility. Finally, we integrate these feedback mechanisms with both
planning-based and learning-based dissection methods, and demonstrate
experimentally that they significantly enhance autonomy, reduce errors, and
improve robustness in complex surgical scenarios.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in modern control applications, particularly in
robot and vehicle motion control, is achieving accurate, fast, and safe
movement. To address this, optimal control policies have been developed to
enforce safety while ensuring high performance. Since basic first-principles
models of real systems are often available, model-based controllers are widely
used. Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes
performance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining
accurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven
alternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on
hand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal
policies directly from interaction data. Data-enabled predictive control
(DeePC) goes further by bypassing modeling altogether, directly learning safe
policies from raw input-output data. Recently, large language model (LLM)
agents have also emerged, translating natural language instructions into
structured formulations of optimal control problems. Despite these advances,
data-driven policies face significant limitations. They often suffer from slow
response times, high computational demands, and large memory needs, making them
less practical for real-world systems with fast dynamics, limited onboard
computing, or strict memory constraints. To address this, various technique,
such as reduced-order modeling, function-approximated policy learning, and
convex relaxations, have been proposed to reduce computational complexity. In
this paper, we present eight such approaches and demonstrate their
effectiveness across real-world applications, including robotic arms, soft
robots, and vehicle motion control.

Result: 实验表明，HEHA能比基线方法减少高达30%的探索时间。

Conclusion: HEHA通过分层规划和异构性优化，有效提升了多机器人探索的效率。

Abstract: This paper considers the path planning problem for autonomous exploration of
an unknown environment using multiple heterogeneous robots such as drones,
wheeled, and legged robots, which have different capabilities to traverse
complex terrains. A key challenge there is to intelligently allocate the robots
to the unknown areas to be explored and determine the visiting order of those
spaces subject to traversablity constraints, which leads to a large scale
constrained optimization problem that needs to be quickly and iteratively
solved every time when new space are explored. To address the challenge, we
propose HEHA (Hierarchical Exploration with Heterogeneous Agents) by leveraging
a recent hierarchical method that decompose the exploration into global
planning and local planning. The major contribution in HEHA is its global
planning, where we propose a new routing algorithm PEAF (Partial Anytime Focal
search) that can quickly find bounded sub-optimal solutions to minimize the
maximum path length among the agents subject to traversability constraints.
Additionally, the local planner in HEHA also considers heterogeneity to avoid
repeated and duplicated exploration among the robots. The experimental results
show that, our HEHA can reduce up to 30% of the exploration time than the
baselines.

TL;DR: 这是一篇关于利用数据驱动的强化学习方法实现挖掘机抓取岩石的论文，无需建模岩石或土壤特性，展示了在非结构化环境中的高效表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的岩石抓取依赖熟练操作员，且现有自动化方法局限于连续介质或专用夹具，难以适应实际建筑工地的需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在未见过的岩石和土壤条件下表现良好，成功率接近人类操作员，同时保持机器稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于学习的策略可以在不需要专用硬件或详细材料模型的情况下，有效处理离散物体操作问题。

Abstract: Rock capturing with standard excavator buckets is a challenging task
typically requiring the expertise of skilled operators. Unlike soil digging, it
involves manipulating large, irregular rocks in unstructured environments where
complex contact interactions with granular material make model-based control
impractical. Existing autonomous excavation methods focus mainly on continuous
media or rely on specialized grippers, limiting their applicability to
real-world construction sites. This paper introduces a fully data-driven
control framework for rock capturing that eliminates the need for explicit
modeling of rock or soil properties. A model-free reinforcement learning agent
is trained in the AGX Dynamics simulator using the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm and a guiding reward formulation. The learned policy outputs
joint velocity commands directly to the boom, arm, and bucket of a CAT365
excavator model. Robustness is enhanced through extensive domain randomization
of rock geometry, density, and mass, as well as the initial configurations of
the bucket, rock, and goal position. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to develop and evaluate an RL-based controller for the rock
capturing task. Experimental results show that the policy generalizes well to
unseen rocks and varying soil conditions, achieving high success rates
comparable to those of human participants while maintaining machine stability.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of learning-based excavation
strategies for discrete object manipulation without requiring specialized
hardware or detailed material models.

Conclusion: VBM-NET提供了一种高效且实用的基座姿态选择方案，适用于实际移动操作任务。

Abstract: In Mobile Manipulation, selecting an optimal mobile base pose is essential
for successful object grasping. Previous works have addressed this problem
either through classical planning methods or by learning state-based policies.
They assume access to reliable state information, such as the precise object
poses and environment models. In this work, we study base pose planning
directly from top-down orthographic projections of the scene, which provide a
global overview of the scene while preserving spatial structure. We propose
VBM-NET, a learning-based method for base pose selection using such top-down
orthographic projections. We use equivariant TransporterNet to exploit spatial
symmetries and efficiently learn candidate base poses for grasping. Further, we
use graph neural networks to represent a varying number of candidate base poses
and use Reinforcement Learning to determine the optimal base pose among them.
We show that VBM-NET can produce comparable solutions to the classical methods
in significantly less computation time. Furthermore, we validate sim-to-real
transfer by successfully deploying a policy trained in simulation to real-world
mobile manipulation.

Abstract: Transcatheter valve repair presents significant challenges due to the
mechanical limitations and steep learning curve associated with manual catheter
systems. This paper investigates the use of robotics to facilitate
transcatheter procedures in the context of mitral valve edge-to-edge repair.
The complex handle-based control of a clinical repair device is replaced by
intuitive robotic joint-based control via a game controller. Manual versus
robotic performance is analyzed by decomposing the overall device delivery task
into motion-specific steps and comparing capabilities on a step-by-step basis
in a phantom model of the heart and vasculature. Metrics include procedure
duration and clip placement accuracy. Results demonstrate that the robotic
system can reduce procedural time and motion errors while also improving
accuracy of clip placement. These findings suggest that robotic assistance can
address key limitations of manual systems, offering a more reliable and
user-friendly platform for complex transcatheter procedures.

Abstract: In the study, the social robot act as a patrol to recognize and notify
illegal parking in real-time. Dual-model pipeline method and large multimodal

plate recognition without preprocessing. For moving smoothly on a flat ground,
the robot navigated in a simulated parking lot in the experiments. The robot
changes angle view of the camera automatically to capture the images around
with the format of license plate number. From the captured images of the robot,
the numbers on the plate are recognized through the GPT-4o model, and
identifies legality of the numbers. When an illegal parking is detected, the
robot sends Line messages to the system manager immediately. The contribution
of the work is that a novel multimodal deep learning method has validated with
high accuracy in license plate recognition, and a social assistive robot is
also provided for solving problems in a real scenario, and can be applied in an
indoor parking lot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法生成的策略固定且难以适应新行为，而经典MPC依赖精确的动力学模型。论文旨在结合两者的优势，提出更灵活的控制方法。

Method: Diffusion-MPC利用学习的生成扩散模型作为动力学先验，通过奖励和约束优化实现灵活规划。设计了交互式训练算法提升模型的适应性。

Result: Diffusion-MPC在真实世界中展示了强大的运动能力和灵活的适应性，能够在不重新训练的情况下适应新的奖励规范。

Conclusion: Diffusion-MPC成功结合了扩散模型和MPC的优势，提供了更具适应性的运动控制解决方案。

Abstract: Legged locomotion demands controllers that are both robust and adaptable,
while remaining compatible with task and safety considerations. However,
model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods often yield a fixed policy that
can be difficult to adapt to new behaviors at test time. In contrast, Model
Predictive Control (MPC) provides a natural approach to flexible behavior
synthesis by incorporating different objectives and constraints directly into
its optimization process. However, classical MPC relies on accurate dynamics
models, which are often difficult to obtain in complex environments and
typically require simplifying assumptions. We present Diffusion-MPC, which
leverages a learned generative diffusion model as an approximate dynamics prior
for planning, enabling flexible test-time adaptation through reward and
constraint based optimization. Diffusion-MPC jointly predicts future states and
actions; at each reverse step, we incorporate reward planning and impose
constraint projection, yielding trajectories that satisfy task objectives while
remaining within physical limits. To obtain a planning model that adapts beyond
imitation pretraining, we introduce an interactive training algorithm for
diffusion based planner: we execute our reward-and-constraint planner in
environment, then filter and reweight the collected trajectories by their
realized returns before updating the denoiser. Our design enables strong
test-time adaptability, allowing the planner to adjust to new reward
specifications without retraining. We validate Diffusion-MPC on real world,
demonstrating strong locomotion and flexible adaptation.

Result: ContextVLA相比单帧VLA表现更优，且减少了训练和推理时间。

Conclusion: ContextVLA提供了高效利用多帧观测的新方法，提升了任务性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Leveraging temporal context is crucial for success in partially observable
robotic tasks. However, prior work in behavior cloning has demonstrated
inconsistent performance gains when using multi-frame observations. In this
paper, we introduce ContextVLA, a policy model that robustly improves robotic
task performance by effectively leveraging multi-frame observations. Our
approach is motivated by the key observation that Vision-Language-Action models
(VLA), i.e., policy models built upon a Vision-Language Model (VLM), more
effectively utilize multi-frame observations for action generation. This
suggests that VLMs' inherent temporal understanding capability enables them to
extract more meaningful context from multi-frame observations. However, the
high dimensionality of video inputs introduces significant computational
overhead, making VLA training and inference inefficient. To address this,
ContextVLA compresses past observations into a single context token, allowing
the policy to efficiently leverage temporal context for action generation. Our
experiments show that ContextVLA consistently improves over single-frame VLAs
and achieves the benefits of full multi-frame training but with reduced
training and inference times.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) faces significant limitations when applied to
systems evolving on nonlinear manifolds, such as robotic attitude dynamics and
constrained motion planning, where traditional Euclidean formulations struggle
with singularities, over-parameterization, and poor convergence. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces FactorMPC, a factor-graph based MPC
toolkit that unifies system dynamics, constraints, and objectives into a
modular, user-friendly, and efficient optimization structure. Our approach
natively supports manifold-valued states with Gaussian uncertainties modeled in
tangent spaces. By exploiting the sparsity and probabilistic structure of
factor graphs, the toolkit achieves real-time performance even for
high-dimensional systems with complex constraints. The velocity-extended
on-manifold control barrier function (CBF)-based obstacle avoidance factors are
designed for safety-critical applications. By bridging graphical models with
safety-critical MPC, our work offers a scalable and geometrically consistent
framework for integrated planning and control. The simulations and experimental
results on the quadrotor demonstrate superior trajectory tracking and obstacle
avoidance performance compared to baseline methods. To foster research
reproducibility, we have provided open-source implementation offering
plug-and-play factors.

Abstract: Teleoperation is a powerful method to generate reference motions and enable
humanoid robots to perform a broad range of tasks. However, teleoperation
becomes challenging when using hand contacts and non-coplanar surfaces, often
leading to motor torque saturation or loss of stability through slipping. We
propose a centroidal stability-based retargeting method that dynamically
adjusts contact points and posture during teleoperation to enhance stability in
these difficult scenarios. Central to our approach is an efficient analytical
calculation of the stability margin gradient. This gradient is used to identify
scenarios for which stability is highly sensitive to teleoperation setpoints
and inform the local adjustment of these setpoints. We validate the framework
in simulation and hardware by teleoperating manipulation tasks on a humanoid,
demonstrating increased stability margins. We also demonstrate empirically that
higher stability margins correlate with improved impulse resilience and joint
torque margin.

Abstract: Rapid progress in imitation learning, foundation models, and large-scale
datasets has led to robot manipulation policies that generalize to a wide-range
of tasks and environments. However, rigorous evaluation of these policies
remains a challenge. Typically in practice, robot policies are often evaluated
on a small number of hardware trials without any statistical assurances. We
present SureSim, a framework to augment large-scale simulation with relatively
small-scale real-world testing to provide reliable inferences on the real-world
performance of a policy. Our key idea is to formalize the problem of combining
real and simulation evaluations as a prediction-powered inference problem, in
which a small number of paired real and simulation evaluations are used to
rectify bias in large-scale simulation. We then leverage non-asymptotic mean
estimation algorithms to provide confidence intervals on mean policy
performance. Using physics-based simulation, we evaluate both diffusion policy
and multi-task fine-tuned \(\pi_0\) on a joint distribution of objects and
initial conditions, and find that our approach saves over \(20-25\%\) of
hardware evaluation effort to achieve similar bounds on policy performance.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory
optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability
distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic
feasi- bility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory
optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on
a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied
to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce
constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In
this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via
model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure
dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is
incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that,
compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero
dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a
quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.

Abstract: Data-driven control methods such as data-enabled predictive control (DeePC)
have shown strong potential in efficient control of soft robots without

paper, we present a novel velocity-form DeePC framework that achieves robust
and optimal control of soft robots under unknown payloads. The proposed
framework leverages input-output data in an incremental representation to
mitigate performance degradation induced by unknown payloads, eliminating the
need for weighted datasets or disturbance estimators. We validate the method
experimentally on a planar soft robot and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to standard DeePC in scenarios involving unknown payloads.

Abstract: Grasping objects across vastly different sizes and physical states-including
both solids and liquids-with a single robotic gripper remains a fundamental
challenge in soft robotics. We present the Everything-Grasping (EG) Gripper, a
soft end-effector that synergistically integrates distributed surface suction
with internal granular jamming, enabling cross-scale and cross-state
manipulation without requiring airtight sealing at the contact interface with
target objects. The EG Gripper can handle objects with surface areas ranging
from sub-millimeter scale 0.2 mm2 (glass bead) to over 62,000 mm2 (A4 sized
paper and woven bag), enabling manipulation of objects nearly 3,500X smaller
and 88X larger than its own contact area (approximated at 707 mm2 for a 30
mm-diameter base). We further introduce a tactile sensing framework that
combines liquid detection and pressure-based suction feedback, enabling
real-time differentiation between solid and liquid targets. Guided by the
actile-Inferred Grasping Mode Selection (TIGMS) algorithm, the gripper
autonomously selects grasping modes based on distributed pressure and voltage
signals. Experiments across diverse tasks-including underwater grasping,
fragile object handling, and liquid capture-demonstrate robust and repeatable
performance. To our knowledge, this is the first soft gripper to reliably grasp
both solid and liquid objects across scales using a unified compliant
architecture.

Conclusion: MobRT填补了移动机械臂数据收集的空白，为复杂任务提供了可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics have been largely driven by imitation learning,
which depends critically on large-scale, high-quality demonstration data.
However, collecting such data remains a significant challenge-particularly for
mobile manipulators, which must coordinate base locomotion and arm manipulation
in high-dimensional, dynamic, and partially observable environments.
Consequently, most existing research remains focused on simpler tabletop
scenarios, leaving mobile manipulation relatively underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we present \textit{MobRT}, a digital twin-based framework designed to
simulate two primary categories of complex, whole-body tasks: interaction with
articulated objects (e.g., opening doors and drawers) and mobile-base
pick-and-place operations. \textit{MobRT} autonomously generates diverse and
realistic demonstrations through the integration of virtual kinematic control
and whole-body motion planning, enabling coherent and physically consistent
execution. We evaluate the quality of \textit{MobRT}-generated data across
multiple baseline algorithms, establishing a comprehensive benchmark and
demonstrating a strong correlation between task success and the number of
generated trajectories. Experiments integrating both simulated and real-world
demonstrations confirm that our approach markedly improves policy
generalization and performance, achieving robust results in both simulated and
real-world environments.

Our unified SLAM framework seamlessly integrates different sensor modalities:
visual, inertial, measured or learned depth, LiDAR and Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. Unlike most state-of-the-art SLAM
systems, we advocate using dense volumetric map representations when leveraging
depth or range-sensing capabilities. We employ an efficient submapping strategy
that allows our system to scale to large environments, showcased in sequences
of up to 9 kilometers. OKVIS2-X enhances its accuracy and robustness by
tightly-coupling the estimator and submaps through map alignment factors. Our
system provides globally consistent maps, directly usable for autonomous
navigation. To further improve the accuracy of OKVIS2-X, we also incorporate
the option of performing online calibration of camera extrinsics. Our system
achieves the highest trajectory accuracy in EuRoC against state-of-the-art
alternatives, outperforms all competitors in the Hilti22 VI-only benchmark,
while also proving competitive in the LiDAR version, and showcases state of the

Abstract: Biomimetic intelligence and robotics are transforming field ecology by
enabling lifelike robotic surrogates that interact naturally with animals under
real world conditions. Studying avian behavior in the wild remains challenging
due to the need for highly realistic morphology, durable outdoor operation, and
intelligent perception that can adapt to uncontrolled environments. We present
a next generation bio inspired robotic platform that replicates the morphology
and visual appearance of the female Houbara bustard to support controlled
ethological studies and conservation oriented field research. The system
introduces a fully digitally replicable fabrication workflow that combines high
resolution structured light 3D scanning, parametric CAD modelling, articulated
3D printing, and photorealistic UV textured vinyl finishing to achieve
anatomically accurate and durable robotic surrogates. A six wheeled rocker
bogie chassis ensures stable mobility on sand and irregular terrain, while an
embedded NVIDIA Jetson module enables real time RGB and thermal perception,
lightweight YOLO based detection, and an autonomous visual servoing loop that
aligns the robot's head toward detected targets without human intervention. A
lightweight thermal visible fusion module enhances perception in low light
conditions. Field trials in desert aviaries demonstrated reliable real time
operation at 15 to 22 FPS with latency under 100 ms and confirmed that the
platform elicits natural recognition and interactive responses from live
Houbara bustards under harsh outdoor conditions. This integrated framework
advances biomimetic field robotics by uniting reproducible digital fabrication,
embodied visual intelligence, and ecological validation, providing a
transferable blueprint for animal robot interaction research, conservation
robotics, and public engagement.

Result: 该方法在物理双臂装配任务中表现出色，能够自动生成重试、协调动作和自主交接。

Conclusion: 梯度框架在长时任务中高效，适用于紧公差装配任务，展现了适应性强的特点。

Abstract: There are many challenges in bimanual assembly, including high-level
sequencing, multi-robot coordination, and low-level, contact-rich operations
such as component mating. Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods, while
effective in this domain, may be prohibitively slow to converge when adapting
to disturbances that require new task sequencing and optimisation. These events
are common during tight-tolerance assembly, where difficult-to-model dynamics
such as friction or deformation require rapid replanning and reattempts.
Moreover, defining explicit task sequences for assembly can be cumbersome,
limiting flexibility when task replanning is required. To simplify this
planning, we introduce a decentralised gradient-based framework that uses a
piecewise continuous energy function through the automatic composition of
adaptive potential functions. This approach generates sub-goals using only
myopic optimisation, rather than long-horizon planning. It demonstrates
effectiveness at solving long-horizon tasks due to the structure and adaptivity
of the energy function. We show that our approach scales to physical bimanual
assembly tasks for constructing tight-tolerance assemblies. In these
experiments, we discover that our gradient-based rapid replanning framework
generates automatic retries, coordinated motions and autonomous handovers in an
emergent fashion.

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for task-specific design optimization of

TL;DR: TAG-K是一种轻量级的Kaczmarz方法扩展，结合贪婪随机行选择和尾部平均，用于在线惯性参数估计，在动态环境中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线惯性参数估计对于自适应机器人控制至关重要，但传统方法（如RLS和KF）难以应对参数突变或计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出TAG-K方法，结合贪婪随机行选择和尾部平均，实现快速收敛和噪声鲁棒性。

Result: TAG-K在合成基准和四旋翼跟踪任务中，计算速度提升1.5x-20.7x，估计误差降低25%，跟踪性能提高近2倍。

Conclusion: TAG-K是一种高效且鲁棒的参数估计方法，适用于动态环境和计算资源受限的机器人系统。

Abstract: Accurate online inertial parameter estimation is essential for adaptive
robotic control, enabling real-time adjustment to payload changes,
environmental interactions, and system wear. Traditional methods such as
Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and the Kalman Filter (KF) often struggle to
track abrupt parameter shifts or incur high computational costs, limiting their
effectiveness in dynamic environments and for computationally constrained
robotic systems. As such, we introduce TAG-K, a lightweight extension of the
Kaczmarz method that combines greedy randomized row selection for rapid
convergence with tail averaging for robustness under noise and inconsistency.
This design enables fast, stable parameter adaptation while retaining the low
per-iteration complexity inherent to the Kaczmarz framework. We evaluate TAG-K
in synthetic benchmarks and quadrotor tracking tasks against RLS, KF, and other
Kaczmarz variants. TAG-K achieves 1.5x-1.9x faster solve times on laptop-class
CPUs and 4.8x-20.7x faster solve times on embedded microcontrollers. More
importantly, these speedups are paired with improved resilience to measurement
noise and a 25% reduction in estimation error, leading to nearly 2x better
end-to-end tracking performance.

Motivation: 红外流在低光环境下比RGB更抗噪，但受主动发射器模式干扰，影响高级任务（如目标检测、跟踪和定位）。

Method: 采用U-Net架构重建干净的红外图像，减少发射器模式的干扰。

Result: 该方法优于现有增强技术，支持机器人在从光照充足到极低光场景下的可靠运行。

Conclusion: 该方法的图像重建能力显著提升了机器人系统的视觉感知性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for enabling robust robotic perception
in dark environments using infrared (IR) stream. IR stream is less susceptible
to noise than RGB in low-light conditions. However, it is dominated by active
emitter patterns that hinder high-level tasks such as object detection,
tracking and localisation. To address this, a U-Net-based architecture is
proposed that reconstructs clean IR images from emitter-populated input,
improving both image quality and downstream robotic performance. This approach
outperforms existing enhancement techniques and enables reliable operation of
vision-driven robotic systems across illumination conditions from well-lit to
extreme low-light scenes.

TL;DR: HyperVLA是一种基于超网络的Vision-Language-Action模型，显著降低了推理成本，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Vision-Language-Action模型的推理成本过高，限制了其实际应用能力。

Result: 在保持或超越性能的同时，减少了90倍的参数激活和120倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: HyperVLA是一种高效且高性能的解决方案，适用于多任务机器人政策学习。

Abstract: Built upon language and vision foundation models with strong generalization
ability and trained on large-scale robotic data, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models have recently emerged as a promising approach to learning generalist
robotic policies. However, a key drawback of existing VLAs is their extremely
high inference costs. In this paper, we propose HyperVLA to address this
problem. Unlike existing monolithic VLAs that activate the whole model during
both training and inference, HyperVLA uses a novel hypernetwork (HN)-based
architecture that activates only a small task-specific policy during inference,
while still retaining the high model capacity needed to accommodate diverse
multi-task behaviors during training. Successfully training an HN-based VLA is
nontrivial so HyperVLA contains several key algorithm design features that
improve its performance, including properly utilizing the prior knowledge from
existing vision foundation models, HN normalization, and an action generation
strategy. Compared to monolithic VLAs, HyperVLA achieves a similar or even
higher success rate for both zero-shot generalization and few-shot adaptation,
while significantly reducing inference costs. Compared to OpenVLA, a
state-of-the-art VLA model, HyperVLA reduces the number of activated parameters
at test time by $90\times$, and accelerates inference speed by $120\times$.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的高层规划框架，用于提升未知室内环境中的自主导航效率，相比传统方法路径缩短约10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统探索方法因全局推理能力有限且依赖局部启发式规则，常导致路径低效。本文旨在通过VLM的直接推理能力改善这一问题。

Method: 将3D占据网格转化为部分2D地图，生成候选子目标，并由VLM评估排序。该方法集成至先进轨迹规划器DYNUS中。

Result: VLM能从未完整地图推断结构模式（如房间、走廊），平衡目标进展与未知空间风险，路径平均缩短约10%。

Conclusion: 结合VLM的规划框架显著提升了导航效率，减少了贪婪策略的常见失败。

Abstract: We present a novel high-level planning framework that leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to improve autonomous navigation in unknown
indoor environments with many dead ends. Traditional exploration methods often
take inefficient routes due to limited global reasoning and reliance on local
heuristics. In contrast, our approach enables a VLM to reason directly about an
occupancy map in a zero-shot manner, selecting subgoals that are likely to lead
to more efficient paths. At each planning step, we convert a 3D occupancy grid
into a partial 2D map of the environment, and generate candidate subgoals. Each
subgoal is then evaluated and ranked against other candidates by the model. We
integrate this planning scheme into DYNUS \cite{kondo2025dynus}, a
state-of-the-art trajectory planner, and demonstrate improved navigation
efficiency in simulation. The VLM infers structural patterns (e.g., rooms,
corridors) from incomplete maps and balances the need to make progress toward a
goal against the risk of entering unknown space. This reduces common greedy
failures (e.g., detouring into small rooms) and achieves about 10\% shorter
paths on average.

Motivation: 探索非生物形态机器人在人类工程环境中的潜在优势。

Method: 结合了简化模型和深度强化学习（DRL）来开发和控制机器人的多种步态。

Result: 机器人实现了两种理论步态并通过DRL发现新行为，展示了非生物形态的多模态运动潜力。

Conclusion: TARS3D展示了非生物形态机器人在多模态运动中的潜力，结合分析与学习的方法是未来机器人研究的有效途径。

Abstract: Robotic locomotion research typically draws from biologically inspired leg
designs, yet many human-engineered settings can benefit from
non-anthropomorphic forms. TARS3D translates the block-shaped 'TARS' robot from
Interstellar into a 0.25 m, 0.99 kg research platform with seven actuated
degrees of freedom. The film shows two primary gaits: a bipedal-like walk and a
high-speed rolling mode. For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each,
derive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on
hardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip
limits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an
eight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg
provides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke
double rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far
richer gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we
used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored
space. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under
the right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that
TARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple
previously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search
is likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and
reinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics.

Method: 采用轻量编码器和预训练DiT解码器，学习两令牌状态表示，并通过潜在插值生成潜在动作。

Conclusion: StaMo方法通过静态图像学习通用运动表示，减少了对复杂架构和视频数据的依赖，具有广泛适用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in embodied intelligence is developing expressive and
compact state representations for efficient world modeling and decision making.
However, existing methods often fail to achieve this balance, yielding
representations that are either overly redundant or lacking in task-critical
information. We propose an unsupervised approach that learns a highly
compressed two-token state representation using a lightweight encoder and a
pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder, capitalizing on its strong
generative prior. Our representation is efficient, interpretable, and
integrates seamlessly into existing VLA-based models, improving performance by
14.3% on LIBERO and 30% in real-world task success with minimal inference
overhead. More importantly, we find that the difference between these tokens,
obtained via latent interpolation, naturally serves as a highly effective
latent action, which can be further decoded into executable robot actions. This
emergent capability reveals that our representation captures structured
dynamics without explicit supervision. We name our method StaMo for its ability
to learn generalizable robotic Motion from compact State representation, which
is encoded from static images, challenging the prevalent dependence to learning
latent action on complex architectures and video data. The resulting latent
actions also enhance policy co-training, outperforming prior methods by 10.4%
with improved interpretability. Moreover, our approach scales effectively
across diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and
human egocentric video.

Result: ACQL在连续控制任务中表现优于现有方法，成功应用于6-DOF机械臂任务。

Conclusion: ACQL是一种鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案，适用于复杂时序规范的机器人学习。

Abstract: Real-world robotic tasks often require agents to achieve sequences of goals
while respecting time-varying safety constraints. However, standard
Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms are fundamentally limited in these
settings. A natural approach to these problems is to combine RL with
Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL), a formal language for specifying complex,
temporally extended tasks and safety constraints. Yet, existing RL methods for
LTL objectives exhibit poor empirical performance in complex and continuous
environments. As a result, no scalable methods support both temporally ordered
goals and safety simultaneously, making them ill-suited for realistic robotics
scenarios. We propose Automaton Constrained Q-Learning (ACQL), an algorithm
that addresses this gap by combining goal-conditioned value learning with
automaton-guided reinforcement. ACQL supports most LTL task specifications and
leverages their automaton representation to explicitly encode stage-wise goal
progression and both stationary and non-stationary safety constraints. We show
that ACQL outperforms existing methods across a range of continuous control
tasks, including cases where prior methods fail to satisfy either goal-reaching
or safety constraints. We further validate its real-world applicability by
deploying ACQL on a 6-DOF robotic arm performing a goal-reaching task in a
cluttered, cabinet-like space with safety constraints. Our results demonstrate
that ACQL is a robust and scalable solution for learning robotic behaviors
according to rich temporal specifications.

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body loco-manipulation promises transformative capabilities
for daily service and warehouse tasks. While recent advances in general motion
tracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these
policies lack the precision and object awareness required for
loco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual
learning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human
motion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion,
serves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements.
An efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT
outputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further
facilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object
tracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that
encourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a
curriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We
evaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results
show substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness
over strong baselines. Videos are available at https://resmimic.github.io/ .

Conclusion: 研究表明，真实的VI测试平台可以有效验证学习型qPACT方法，为其进一步的实验研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is a promising imaging
modality for estimating physiological parameters such as blood oxygen
saturation. However, developing robust qPACT reconstruction methods remains
challenging due to computational demands, modeling difficulties, and
experimental uncertainties. Learning-based methods have been proposed to
address these issues but remain largely unvalidated. Virtual imaging (VI)
studies are essential for validating such methods early in development, before
proceeding to less-controlled phantom or in vivo studies. Effective VI studies
must employ ensembles of stochastically generated numerical phantoms that
accurately reflect relevant anatomy and physiology. Yet, most prior VI studies
for qPACT relied on overly simplified phantoms. In this work, a realistic VI
testbed is employed for the first time to assess a representative 3D
learning-based qPACT reconstruction method for breast imaging. The method is
evaluated across subject variability and physical factors such as measurement
noise and acoustic aberrations, offering insights into its strengths and
limitations.

Motivation: 导频污染攻击（PCA）威胁无线通信系统的安全，传统检测方法（如LRT）依赖先验假设，本研究旨在探索DT算法的优势。

Method: 生成DT分类器的训练数据，选择最佳深度的DT，并在多场景中模拟比较DT与LRT的性能。

Result: 单层深度的DT即可超越LRT，尤其在噪声和低功率攻击场景中表现优异，且无需噪声或信号功率的先验信息。

Conclusion: DT算法在PCA检测中具有显著优势，无需复杂假设，适用于实际无线通信系统。

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MMIMO) is essential to modern
wireless communication systems, like 5G and 6G, but it is vulnerable to active
eavesdropping attacks. One type of such attack is the pilot contamination
attack (PCA), where a malicious user copies pilot signals from an authentic
user during uplink, intentionally interfering with the base station's (BS)
channel estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose to use a Decision Tree
(DT) algorithm for PCA detection at the BS in a multi-user system. We present a
methodology to generate training data for the DT classifier and select the best
DT according to their depth. Then, we simulate different scenarios that could
be encountered in practice and compare the DT to a classical technique based on
likelihood ratio testing (LRT) submitted to the same scenarios. The results
revealed that a DT with only one level of depth is sufficient to outperform the
LRT. The DT shows a good performance regarding the probability of detection in
noisy scenarios and when the malicious user transmits with low power, in which
case the LRT fails to detect the PCA. We also show that the reason for the good
performance of the DT is its ability to compute a threshold that separates PCA
data from non-PCA data better than the LRT's threshold. Moreover, the DT does
not necessitate prior knowledge of noise power or assumptions regarding the
signal power of malicious users, prerequisites typically essential for LRT and
other hypothesis testing methodologies.

Conclusion: 论文为社区提供了新的数据集和诊断工具，未来可评估模型的因果真实性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Model (VLM) driving agents promise explainable end-to-end
autonomy by first producing natural-language reasoning and then predicting
trajectory planning. However, whether planning is causally driven by this
reasoning remains a critical but unverified assumption. To investigate this, we
build DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus
with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT), automatically generated from nuPlan.
Our data generation process converts sensors and annotations into structured
inputs and, crucially, separates priors from to-be-reasoned signals, enabling
clean information ablations. Using DriveMind, we train representative VLM
agents with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) and evaluate them with nuPlan's metrics. Our results, unfortunately,
indicate a consistent causal disconnect in reasoning-planning: removing
ego/navigation priors causes large drops in planning scores, whereas removing
CoT produces only minor changes. Attention analysis further shows that planning
primarily focuses on priors rather than the CoT. Based on this evidence, we
propose the Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis, positing that the
training-yielded reasoning is an ancillary byproduct rather than a causal
mediator. To enable efficient diagnosis, we also introduce a novel,
training-free probe that measures an agent's reliance on priors by evaluating
its planning robustness against minor input perturbations. In summary, we
provide the community with a new dataset and a diagnostic tool to evaluate the

### [88] [Agile Tradespace Exploration for Space Rendezvous Mission Design via Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03544)
*Yuji Takubo,Daniele Gammelli,Marco Pavone,Simone D'Amico*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于AI的Transformer架构框架，用于快速生成多目标优化的太空交会任务轨迹，支持高效的任务设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太空交会任务设计需要在控制成本和飞行时间之间进行多目标优化，但非凸约束使得传统方法效率低、迭代慢。

Method: 利用Transformer架构，通过并行推理生成近似Pareto最优轨迹，适应可变飞行时间和扰动轨道动力学。

Result: 验证表明，模型在飞行时间和动力学上均能泛化，提供高质量初始解，显著减少收敛迭代次数。

Conclusion: 该框架为非线性轨迹生成提供了实用替代方案，推动了AI驱动的任务设计在现实交会应用中的应用。

Abstract: Spacecraft rendezvous enables on-orbit servicing, debris removal, and crewed
docking, forming the foundation for a scalable space economy. Designing such
missions requires rapid exploration of the tradespace between control cost and
flight time across multiple candidate targets. However, multi-objective
optimization in this setting is challenging, as the underlying constraints are
often highly nonconvex, and mission designers must balance accuracy (e.g.,
solving the full problem) with efficiency (e.g., convex relaxations), slowing
iteration and limiting design agility. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes an AI-powered framework that enables agile mission design for a wide
range of Earth orbit rendezvous scenarios. Given the orbital information of the
target spacecraft, boundary conditions, and a range of flight times, this work
proposes a Transformer-based architecture that generates, in a single
parallelized inference step, a set of near-Pareto optimal trajectories across
varying flight times, thereby enabling rapid mission trade studies. The model
is further extended to accommodate variable flight times and perturbed orbital
dynamics, supporting realistic multi-objective trade-offs. Validation on
chance-constrained rendezvous problems with passive safety constraints
demonstrates that the model generalizes across both flight times and dynamics,
consistently providing high-quality initial guesses that converge to superior
solutions in fewer iterations. Moreover, the framework efficiently approximates
the Pareto front, achieving runtimes comparable to convex relaxation by
exploiting parallelized inference. Together, these results position the
proposed framework as a practical surrogate for nonconvex trajectory generation
and mark an important step toward AI-driven trajectory design for accelerating
preliminary mission planning in real-world rendezvous applications.

*Nahshon Mokua Obiri,Kristof Van Laerhoven*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种环境感知的室内LoRaWAN传播路径损耗框架，通过多环境协变量和多方法建模提升预测精度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对数距离模型和正态阴影假设在室内环境中受到结构和时变因素的挑战，需开发更准确的模型。

Method: 结合环境协变量和多方法建模（如多项式回归、贝叶斯回归等），使用核密度估计和非参数方法分析阴影衰落。

Result: 多项式均值将交叉验证RMSE从8.07降至7.09 dB，R^2从0.81提升至0.86；在99%包交付率下，所需衰减余量更低。

Conclusion: 该方法为室内物联网规划提供了高精度和可靠性的工作流程，符合6G目标。

Abstract: Indoor LoRaWAN propagation is shaped by structural and time-varying context
factors, which challenge log-distance models and the assumption of log-normal
shadowing. We present an environment-aware, statistically disciplined path loss
framework evaluated using leakage-safe cross-validation on a 12-month campaign
in an eighth-floor office measuring 240 m^2. A log-distance multi-wall mean is
augmented with environmental covariates (relative humidity, temperature, carbon
dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure), as well as the
signal-to-noise ratio. We compare multiple linear regression with regularized
variants, Bayesian linear regression, and a selective second-order polynomial
applied to continuous drivers. Predictor relevance is established using
heteroscedasticity-robust Type II and III analysis of variance and nested
partial F tests. Shadow fading is profiled with kernel density estimation and
non-parametric families, including Normal, Skew-Normal, Student's t, and
Gaussian mixtures. The polynomial mean reduces cross-validated RMSE from 8.07
to 7.09 dB and raises R^2 from 0.81 to 0.86. Out-of-fold residuals are
non-Gaussian; a 3-component mixture captures a sharp core with a light, broad
tail. We convert accuracy into reliability by prescribing the fade margin as
the upper-tail quantile of cross-validated residuals, quantifying uncertainty
via a moving-block bootstrap, and validating on a held-out set. At 99% packet
delivery ratio, the environment-aware polynomial requires 25.7 dB versus 27.7
to 27.9 dB for linear baselines. This result presents a deployment-ready,
interpretable workflow with calibrated reliability control for indoor Internet
of Things planning, aligned with 6G targets.

### [90] [Privacy Enhancement in Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Adaptive Receive Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03860)
*Faeze Moradi Kalarde,Ben Liang,Min Dong,Yahia A. Eldemerdash Ahmed,Ho Ting Cheng*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为AdaScale的自适应接收缩放因子设计方法，用于在联邦学习中平衡训练收敛性与隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习的无线聚合中，接收缩放因子的选择直接影响信号质量和隐私保护。过大的缩放因子虽能减少噪声，但会降低隐私保护效果，因此需要动态调整以兼顾两者。

Method: 通过随机优化建模，设计新算法AdaScale，动态调整缩放因子，确保长期收敛性的同时最小化Rényi差分隐私泄漏。

Result: AdaScale算法在动态遗憾和约束违反方面有理论上界，实际实验中有效降低了RDP和DP泄漏，不影响学习性能。

Conclusion: AdaScale在动态信道条件下有效平衡了联邦学习的隐私保护与训练收敛性，优于现有基准。

Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL) with over-the-air aggregation, the quality of the
signal received at the server critically depends on the receive scaling
factors. While a larger scaling factor can reduce the effective noise power and
improve training performance, it also compromises the privacy of devices by
reducing uncertainty. In this work, we aim to adaptively design the receive
scaling factors across training rounds to balance the trade-off between
training convergence and privacy in an FL system under dynamic channel
conditions. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the
overall R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) leakage over the entire training
process, subject to a long-term constraint that ensures convergence of the
global loss function. Our problem depends on unknown future information, and we
observe that standard Lyapunov optimization is not applicable. Thus, we develop
a new online algorithm, termed AdaScale, based on a sequence of novel per-round
problems that can be solved efficiently. We further derive upper bounds on the
dynamic regret and constraint violation of AdaSacle, establishing that it
achieves diminishing dynamic regret in terms of time-averaged RDP leakage while
ensuring convergence of FL training to a stationary point. Numerical
experiments on canonical classification tasks show that our approach
effectively reduces RDP and DP leakages compared with state-of-the-art
benchmarks without compromising learning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体在分散式优化中如何共同学习最优解集，同时保护各自可行集的隐私不被泄露的问题。

Method: 设计了一种通信方案，领导智能体通过查询非领导智能体来检索解集，确保信息泄露最小。研究了环形和星形两种通信网络设置。

Result: 研究表明，通过直接学习解集而非联合可行集，可以减少信息泄露，并且在某些情况下通信效率更高。

Conclusion: 提出的方案在保护隐私的同时实现了通信高效性，特别是对于随机映射的目标函数，通信效率优于传统的私有集合交集协议。

Abstract: We consider the problem of decentralized constrained optimization with
multiple agents $E_1,\ldots,E_N$ who jointly wish to learn the optimal solution
set while keeping their feasible sets $\mathcal{P}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{P}_N$
private from each other. We assume that the objective function $f$ is known to
all agents and each feasible set is a collection of points from a universal
alphabet $\mathcal{P}_{alph}$. A designated agent (leader) starts the
communication with the remaining (non-leader) agents, and is the first to
retrieve the solution set. The leader searches for the solution by sending
queries to and receiving answers from the non-leaders, such that the
information on the individual feasible sets revealed to the leader should be no
more than nominal, i.e., what is revealed from learning the solution set alone.
We develop achievable schemes for obtaining the solution set at nominal
information leakage, and characterize their communication costs under two
communication setups between agents. In this work, we focus on two kinds of
network setups: i) ring, where each agent communicates with two adjacent
agents, and ii) star, where only the leader communicates with the remaining
agents. We show that, if the leader first learns the joint feasible set through
an existing private set intersection (PSI) protocol and then deduces the
solution set, the information leaked to the leader is greater than nominal.
Moreover, we draw connection of our schemes to threshold PSI (ThPSI), which is
a PSI-variant where the intersection is revealed only when its cardinality is
larger than a threshold value. Finally, for various realizations of $f$ mapped
uniformly at random to a fixed range of values, our schemes are more
communication-efficient with a high probability compared to retrieving the
entire feasible set through PSI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D医学影像数据集增大和复杂性带来的协作与传输问题。

Method: 在误差容忍和固定速率模式下应用ZFP压缩技术，并与未压缩基线对比分割质量。

Result: ZFP可实现高达22.89:1的数据压缩比，同时保真度高（平均Dice系数0.87656）。

Conclusion: ZFP是促进大规模医学数据集高效协作研究的有效工具。

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly
in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and
transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique
can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated
cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm
detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a
large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical
dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation
quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed
baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can
achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance
mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice
coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a
viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on
large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野生动物保护需要非侵入性监测，但现有方法在计算资源和物种隐蔽性方面存在挑战。

Method: 使用YOLOv10检测和MobileSAM分割的并行框架，降低延迟以提升实时性能。

Result: 在Houbara Bustard数据集上，mAP50达0.9627，mAP75为0.7731，mAP95为0.7178，MobileSAM mIoU为0.7421，YOLOv10每帧耗时43.7毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法高效适用于实时动物监测，并公开了数据集和代码。

Abstract: Real-time animal detection and segmentation in natural environments are vital
for wildlife conservation, enabling non-invasive monitoring through remote
camera streams. However, these tasks remain challenging due to limited
computational resources and the cryptic appearance of many species. We propose
a mobile-optimized two-stage deep learning framework that integrates a
Threading Detection Model (TDM) to parallelize YOLOv10-based detection and
MobileSAM-based segmentation. Unlike prior YOLO+SAM pipelines, our approach
improves real-time performance by reducing latency through threading. YOLOv10
handles detection while MobileSAM performs lightweight segmentation, both
executed concurrently for efficient resource use. On the cryptic Houbara
Bustard, a conservation-priority species, our model achieves mAP50 of 0.9627,
mAP75 of 0.7731, mAP95 of 0.7178, and a MobileSAM mIoU of 0.7421. YOLOv10
operates at 43.7 ms per frame, confirming real-time readiness. We introduce a
curated Houbara dataset of 40,000 annotated images to support model training
and evaluation across diverse conditions. The code and dataset used in this
study are publicly available on GitHub at

TL;DR: SketchPlan是一种基于扩散模型的无人机路径规划系统，通过解析2D手绘草图生成3D飞行路径，实现了零样本从模拟到现实的迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决无人机导航中如何准确理解人类意图并生成安全飞行路径的问题，提出了SketchPlan。

Method: SketchPlan包括SketchAdapter（将手绘草图映射到2D路径）和DiffPath（从2D投影和深度图像生成3D轨迹）。训练数据包括合成的32k路径和872人类标注的草图。

Result: SketchPlan在低/中密度环境中实现了100%成功率，在高密度环境中为40%，优于其他方法20-60%。

Conclusion: 结合人类标注与自动标注数据的模块化设计显著提升了系统性能，验证了其在真实环境中的有效性。

Abstract: We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D
hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone
navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to
map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model
that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth
image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate
and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train
the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set
of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data
by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and
use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D
sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label
872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the
SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate
SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and
show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled
data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to
correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests,
SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen
high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task
completion.

TL;DR: LIBERO-PRO扩展了LIBERO基准，通过系统扰动评估模型，揭示现有模型依赖记忆而非真实理解，准确性从90%降至0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIBERO基准的训练与评估存在问题，导致模型性能评估偏高且不公平，需引入更全面的测试方法。

Method: 在LIBERO-PRO中，通过对物体、初始状态、任务指令和环境四个维度的扰动，系统性评估模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 现有模型在标准LIBERO评估中准确率超90%，但在扰动下崩溃至0%，显示其依赖记忆而非理解。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法存在严重缺陷，社区应采用更健壮的评测标准，关注模型泛化与理解能力。

Abstract: LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and
evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance
estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we
introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically
evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four
dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and
environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models
achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their
performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this
discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action
sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine
task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in
executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant
items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted
instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in
current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon
misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization
and comprehension. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 传统VLA模型在处理物理世界任务时泛化能力差，双系统方法又存在语义模糊性和跨任务训练困难的问题，因此需要一种新框架来解决这些限制。

Method: 利用稀疏3D轨迹作为中间表示，将VLM的粗粒度路点通过动作专家转化为可执行的动作序列，并提出“动作预训练，点云微调”的训练范式。

Result: 该方法结合了VLM的广泛泛化能力和动作专家的精细动作泛化能力，提升了系统在新环境中的适应性和效率。

Conclusion: 该框架在提升VLA模型泛化能力和跨任务适应性方面显示出潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning
and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world
introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture,
generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data.
While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from
"acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action
module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible.
Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly
collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation
mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these
limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a
generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an
intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning
capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the
planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These
waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines
them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud
observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust
generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud
Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization
capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the
fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

Motivation: 集中式VPS无法覆盖私人室内空间，且存在隐私和维护问题。

Method: 采用联邦化的方法，允许独立组织管理自己的VPS服务。

Result: 实现了跨空间的定位一致性、数据质量和选择优化。

Conclusion: OpenFLAME为未来AR应用提供了一种分布式、隐私友好的VPS解决方案。

Abstract: World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF
localization backend to anchor content to the real world consistently across
devices. Large organizations such as Google and Niantic are 3D scanning outdoor
public spaces in order to build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS).
These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR
applications -- they do not cover private indoor spaces because of privacy
concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D
scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows
independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for
their own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed
maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger coverage. Sharding of VPS
services introduces several unique challenges -- coherency of localization
results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right
VPS service for a location, and many others. We introduce the concept of
federated image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing
and merging data across maps without sharing private data.

Conclusion: 研究表明，轻量级光栅化结合特征对齐足以取代高成本的真实感渲染，为端到端驾驶规划提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert
demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery
data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A
promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories
beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via
neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and
costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that
photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is
semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics,
not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which
replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated
primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers
and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively
to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment
that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization
Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning.
RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail
generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo
Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that
lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E
training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering. Project

Result: 诊断准确率提升28%，校准误差降低75%，有效纠正传统模型误判。

Conclusion: 该架构为高可信、可解释的工业AI诊断系统提供了实用工程方案。

Abstract: There are limitations of traditional methods and deep learning methods in
terms of interpretability, generalization, and quantification of uncertainty in
industrial fault diagnosis, and there are core problems of insufficient
credibility in industrial fault diagnosis. The architecture performs
preliminary analysis through a Bayesian network-based diagnostic engine and
features an LLM-driven cognitive quorum module with multimodal input
capabilities. The module conducts expert-level arbitration of initial diagnoses
by analyzing structured features and diagnostic charts, prioritizing final
decisions after conflicts are identified. To ensure the reliability of the
system output, the architecture integrates a confidence calibration module
based on temperature calibration and a risk assessment module, which
objectively quantifies the reliability of the system using metrics such as
expected calibration error (ECE). Experimental results on a dataset containing
multiple fault types showed that the proposed framework improved diagnostic
accuracy by more than 28 percentage points compared to the baseline model,
while the calibrated ECE was reduced by more than 75%. Case studies have
confirmed that HCAA effectively corrects misjudgments caused by complex feature
patterns or knowledge gaps in traditional models, providing novel and practical
engineering solutions for building high-trust, explainable AI diagnostic
systems for industrial applications.

Result: 仿真和硬件实验表明，该方法比基线控制器运行更快，轨迹更平滑。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统控制器的安全问题，并提升了控制性能和轨迹平滑性。

Abstract: Conventional passivity-based torque controllers for manipulators are
typically unconstrained, which can lead to safety violations under external
perturbations. In this paper, we employ viability theory to pre-compute safe
sets in the state-space of joint positions and velocities. These viable sets,
constructed via data-driven and analytical methods for self-collision
avoidance, external object collision avoidance and joint-position and
joint-velocity limits, provide constraints on joint accelerations and thus
joint torques via the robot dynamics. A quadratic programming-based control
framework enforces these constraints on a passive controller tracking a
dynamical system, ensuring the robot states remain within the safe set in an
infinite time horizon. We validate the proposed approach through simulations
and hardware experiments on a 7-DoF Franka Emika manipulator. In comparison to
a baseline constrained passive controller, our method operates at higher
control-loop rates and yields smoother trajectories.

Abstract: Therapist-in-the-loop robotic rehabilitation has shown great promise in
enhancing rehabilitation outcomes by integrating the strengths of therapists
and robotic systems. However, its broader adoption remains limited due to
insufficient safe interaction and limited adaptation capability. This article
proposes a novel telerobotics-mediated framework that enables therapists to
intuitively and safely deliver assist-as-needed~(AAN) therapy based on two
primary contributions. First, our framework encodes the therapist-informed
corrective force into via-points in a latent space, allowing the therapist to
provide only minimal assistance while encouraging patient maintaining own
motion preferences. Second, a shape-adaptive ANN rehabilitation policy is
learned to partially and progressively deform the reference trajectory for
movement therapy based on encoded patient motion preferences and
therapist-informed via-points. The effectiveness of the proposed shape-adaptive
AAN strategy was validated on a telerobotic rehabilitation system using two
representative tasks. The results demonstrate its practicality for remote AAN
therapy and its superiority over two state-of-the-art methods in reducing
corrective force and improving movement smoothness.

Abstract: This paper presents a new multi-query motion planning algorithm for linear
Gaussian systems with the goal of reaching a Euclidean ball with high
probability. We develop a new formulation for ball-shaped ambiguity sets of
Gaussian distributions and leverage it to develop a distributionally robust
belief roadmap construction algorithm. This algorithm synthe- sizes robust
controllers which are certified to be safe for maximal size ball-shaped
ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions. Our algorithm achieves better
coverage than the maximal coverage algorithm for planning over Gaussian
distributions [1], and we identify mild conditions under which our algorithm
achieves strictly better coverage. For the special case of no process noise or
state constraints, we formally prove that our algorithm achieves maximal
coverage. In addition, we present a second multi-query motion planning
algorithm for linear Gaussian systems with the goal of reaching a region
parameterized by the Minkowski sum of an ellipsoid and a Euclidean ball with
high probability. This algorithm plans over ellipsoidal sets of maximal size
ball-shaped ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions, and provably achieves
equal or better coverage than the best-known algorithm for planning over
ellipsoidal ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions [2]. We demonstrate the
efficacy of both methods in a wide range of conditions via extensive simulation
experiments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多层移动边缘计算（MLMEC）框架，结合知识蒸馏（KD）技术，以提高跌倒检测的准确性和降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老龄化人口的增加使得跌倒检测系统（FD）尤为重要，但现有系统在边缘设备（ED）计算能力有限和数据传输延迟方面存在问题，亟需改进。

Method: 通过多层MEC框架，将计算任务分配到不同层级的站点，结合知识蒸馏技术，后端计算能力强的站点为前端提供额外的学习经验，提升整体性能。

Result: 实验表明，在SisFall和FallAllD数据集上，KD技术分别提升了11.65%和2.78%的准确性；同时，MLMEC与KD结合显著降低了数据传输延迟。

Conclusion: MLMEC框架结合KD技术，显著提升了跌倒检测系统的准确性和响应速度，为解决现有挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The rising aging population has increased the importance of fall detection
(FD) systems as an assistive technology, where deep learning techniques are
widely applied to enhance accuracy. FD systems typically use edge devices (EDs)
worn by individuals to collect real-time data, which are transmitted to a cloud
center (CC) or processed locally. However, this architecture faces challenges
such as a limited ED model size and data transmission latency to the CC. Mobile
edge computing (MEC), which allows computations at MEC servers deployed between
EDs and CC, has been explored to address these challenges. We propose a
multilayer MEC (MLMEC) framework to balance accuracy and latency. The MLMEC
splits the architecture into stations, each with a neural network model. If
front-end equipment cannot detect falls reliably, data are transmitted to a
station with more robust back-end computing. The knowledge distillation (KD)
approach was employed to improve front-end detection accuracy by allowing
high-power back-end stations to provide additional learning experiences,
enhancing precision while reducing latency and processing loads. Simulation
results demonstrate that the KD approach improved accuracy by 11.65% on the
SisFall dataset and 2.78% on the FallAllD dataset. The MLMEC with KD also
reduced the data latency rate by 54.15% on the FallAllD dataset and 46.67% on
the SisFall dataset compared to the MLMEC without KD. In summary, the MLMEC FD
system exhibits improved accuracy and reduced latency.

Motivation: 严格的隐私法规和资源需求限制了生物医学时间序列AI的发展，合成数据生成可填补数据需求与可访问性之间的鸿沟。

Method: 采用高级预测模型生成合成数据，准确复制EEG和EMG等复杂电生理信号，保留真实数据的时空和频谱特性。

Result: 合成数据不仅可作为真实数据的有效替代，还显著提升AI模型性能，同时保持关键生物医学特征和高可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI驱动的生物医学研究提供了可扩展的资源支持，同时解决了数据稀缺和隐私保护的双重挑战。

Abstract: The limited data availability due to strict privacy regulations and
significant resource demands severely constrains biomedical time-series AI
development, which creates a critical gap between data requirements and
accessibility. Synthetic data generation presents a promising solution by
producing artificial datasets that maintain the statistical properties of real
biomedical time-series data without compromising patient confidentiality. We
propose a framework for synthetic biomedical time-series data generation based
on advanced forecasting models that accurately replicates complex
electrophysiological signals such as EEG and EMG with high fidelity. These
synthetic datasets preserve essential temporal and spectral properties of real
data, which enables robust analysis while effectively addressing data scarcity
and privacy challenges. Our evaluations across multiple subjects demonstrate
that the generated synthetic data can serve as an effective substitute for real
data and also significantly boost AI model performance. The approach maintains
critical biomedical features while provides high scalability for various
applications and integrates seamlessly into open-source repositories,
substantially expanding resources for AI-driven biomedical research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSSL-AMC 提出了一种基于联邦学习和自监督学习的自动调制分类方法，解决了数据隐私和分布不均的问题，并通过实验验证了其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式训练的自动调制分类方法存在隐私问题和数据分布不均的挑战，而联邦学习在此场景下仍受到类别不平衡和标注数据有限的限制。

Method: 提出 FedSSL-AMC，通过联邦学习和自监督学习（三元组损失）在客户端上训练因果时间膨胀 CNN，再利用少量标注数据训练 SVM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在异构 SNR、载波频率偏移和非独立同分布标签分区下均优于监督式联邦学习基线。

Conclusion: FedSSL-AMC 提供了一种有效解决隐私和分布不均问题的方法，并在实际场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Training automatic modulation classification (AMC) models on centrally
aggregated data raises privacy concerns, incurs communication overhead, and
often fails to confer robustness to channel shifts. Federated learning (FL)
avoids central aggregation by training on distributed clients but remains
sensitive to class imbalance, non-IID client distributions, and limited labeled
samples. We propose FedSSL-AMC, which trains a causal, time-dilated CNN with
triplet-loss self-supervision on unlabeled I/Q sequences across clients,
followed by per-client SVMs on small labeled sets. We establish convergence of
the federated representation learning procedure and a separability guarantee
for the downstream classifier under feature noise. Experiments on synthetic and
over-the-air datasets show consistent gains over supervised FL baselines under
heterogeneous SNR, carrier-frequency offsets, and non-IID label partitions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Stigmergic多智能体深度强化学习（S-MADRL）的框架，通过虚拟信息素实现去中心化协调，解决了狭窄环境中多机器人协调问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 狭窄和受限环境中多机器人协调的挑战，表现为拥堵和干扰问题，影响了集体任务性能。

Method: 借鉴昆虫群体的Stigmergy机制，提出了S-MADRL框架，利用虚拟信息素建模局部和社会交互，并通过课程学习分解复杂任务。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该框架能有效协调多达8个智能体，实现不对称工作负载分布以减少拥堵。

Conclusion: S-MADRL框架展现了在拥挤环境中去中心化多智能体协调的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: We address the challenge of coordinating multiple robots in narrow and
confined environments, where congestion and interference often hinder
collective task performance. Drawing inspiration from insect colonies, which
achieve robust coordination through stigmergy -- modifying and interpreting
environmental traces -- we propose a Stigmergic Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement
Learning (S-MADRL) framework that leverages virtual pheromones to model local
and social interactions, enabling decentralized emergent coordination without
explicit communication. To overcome the convergence and scalability limitations
of existing algorithms such as MADQN, MADDPG, and MAPPO, we leverage curriculum
learning, which decomposes complex tasks into progressively harder
sub-problems. Simulation results show that our framework achieves the most
effective coordination of up to eight agents, where robots self-organize into
asymmetric workload distributions that reduce congestion and modulate group
performance. This emergent behavior, analogous to strategies observed in
nature, demonstrates a scalable solution for decentralized multi-agent
coordination in crowded environments with communication constraints.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统性地将多智能体强化学习（MARL）应用于高空气球（HABs）的分布式区域覆盖协调问题，扩展了RLHAB仿真环境以支持多智能体协作，验证了QMIX方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性方法（如Voronoi分区）对小规模团队和局部任务表现不佳，而单智能体强化学习已证明可行，但多智能体协调尚未探讨。

Method: 扩展RLHAB仿真环境，采用QMIX算法（集中训练分散执行），设计专用观测空间和分层奖励机制。

Result: QMIX在分布式区域覆盖任务中表现与理论最优几何方法相当。

Conclusion: MARL为复杂多HAB任务提供了可行方案，弥补了确定性方法的局限性。

Abstract: High Altitude Balloons (HABs) can leverage stratospheric wind layers for
limited horizontal control, enabling applications in reconnaissance,
environmental monitoring, and communications networks. Existing multi-agent HAB
coordination approaches use deterministic methods like Voronoi partitioning and
extremum seeking control for large global constellations, which perform poorly
for smaller teams and localized missions. While single-agent HAB control using
reinforcement learning has been demonstrated on HABs, coordinated multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) has not yet been investigated. This work presents
the first systematic application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
to HAB coordination for distributed area coverage. We extend our previously
developed reinforcement learning simulation environment (RLHAB) to support
cooperative multi-agent learning, enabling multiple agents to operate
simultaneously in realistic atmospheric conditions. We adapt QMIX for HAB area
coverage coordination, leveraging Centralized Training with Decentralized
Execution to address atmospheric vehicle coordination challenges. Our approach
employs specialized observation spaces providing individual state,
environmental context, and teammate data, with hierarchical rewards
prioritizing coverage while encouraging spatial distribution. We demonstrate
that QMIX achieves similar performance to the theoretically optimal geometric
deterministic method for distributed area coverage, validating the MARL
approach and providing a foundation for more complex autonomous multi-HAB
missions where deterministic methods become intractable.

Motivation: 解决基于模型的强化学习中有效探索的挑战，特别是在高维连续控制任务中提高样本效率。

Method: 提出了PO-MPC框架，通过KL正则化的方法将规划器的行动分布纳入策略优化过程中，从而统一了现有的MPPI-based强化学习方法。

Result: 实验表明，PO-MPC框架显著提升了性能，推动了基于MPPI的强化学习的最新进展。

Conclusion: PO-MPC框架通过统一和扩展现有方法，为解决MBRL中的探索问题提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective exploration remains a central challenge in model-based
reinforcement learning (MBRL), particularly in high-dimensional continuous
control tasks where sample efficiency is crucial. A prominent line of recent
work leverages learned policies as proposal distributions for Model-Predictive
Path Integral (MPPI) planning. Initial approaches update the sampling policy
independently of the planner distribution, typically maximizing a learned value
function with deterministic policy gradient and entropy regularization.
However, because the states encountered during training depend on the MPPI
planner, aligning the sampling policy with the planner improves the accuracy of
value estimation and long-term performance. To this end, recent methods update
the sampling policy by minimizing KL divergence to the planner distribution or
by introducing planner-guided regularization into the policy update. In this
work, we unify these MPPI-based reinforcement learning methods under a single
framework by introducing Policy Optimization-Model Predictive Control (PO-MPC),
a family of KL-regularized MBRL methods that integrate the planner's action
distribution as a prior in policy optimization. By aligning the learned policy
with the planner's behavior, PO-MPC allows more flexibility in the policy
updates to trade off Return maximization and KL divergence minimization. We
clarify how prior approaches emerge as special cases of this family, and we
explore previously unstudied variations. Our experiments show that these
extended configurations yield significant performance improvements, advancing
the state of the art in MPPI-based RL.

Method: 结合监督对比微调和对比表征蒸馏，学习通用声学场景表征，并迁移到小型学生模型中。

Result: ContrastASC在未见类别上表现出更强的少样本适应能力，同时保持封闭集性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了模型的泛化能力和适应性，适用于动态变化的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Acoustic scene classification (ASC) models on edge devices typically operate
under fixed class assumptions, lacking the transferability needed for
real-world applications that require adaptation to new or refined acoustic
categories. We propose ContrastASC, which learns generalizable acoustic scene
representations by structuring the embedding space to preserve semantic
relationships between scenes, enabling adaptation to unseen categories without
retraining. Our approach combines supervised contrastive fine-tuning of
pre-trained models with contrastive representation distillation to transfer
this structured knowledge to compact student models. Our evaluation shows that
ContrastASC demonstrates improved few-shot adaptation to unseen categories
while maintaining strong closed-set performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural instrument sound synthesis
using a two-stage semi-supervised learning framework capable of generating
pitch-accurate, high-quality music samples from an expressive timbre latent
space. Existing approaches that achieve sufficient quality for music production
often rely on high-dimensional latent representations that are difficult to
navigate and provide unintuitive user experiences. We address this limitation
through a two-stage training paradigm: first, we train a pitch-timbre
disentangled 2D representation of audio samples using a Variational
Autoencoder; second, we use this representation as conditioning input for a
Transformer-based generative model. The learned 2D latent space serves as an
intuitive interface for navigating and exploring the sound landscape. We
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively learns a disentangled timbre
space, enabling expressive and controllable audio generation with reliable
pitch conditioning. Experimental results show the model's ability to capture
subtle variations in timbre while maintaining a high degree of pitch accuracy.
The usability of our method is demonstrated in an interactive web application,
highlighting its potential as a step towards future music production
environments that are both intuitive and creatively empowering:
