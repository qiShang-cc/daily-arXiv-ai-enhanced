To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an\nobstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a\nshared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our\napproach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on\nprocedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot\nconfigurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of\nscenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning\nto generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems\nof task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly\ngenerated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen\nsettings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We\nfurther demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its\nuse in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and\nscalability of our planner also open the door to new capabilities such as\nfault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning, where rapid\nadaptation to dynamic task sets is required."}

This study\nevaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art\nSSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision\nTransformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality.

While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from\nhigh-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar\nperformance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent\nrepresentations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over\npre-trained models by $2.7 \\pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \\pm 9.4%$ for high and\nlow-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,\nhigh-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.\nAlthough location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard\nSSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the\nbest-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \\pm 0.075$\nand $0.795 \\pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of\nlocation metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using\nlow-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation\nof high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis."}

Although\noffline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to\ncomplete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of\nenvironmental and operational conditions on seafloor image\nappearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address\nthis, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting\nseafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time\non continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.\nThe method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns\nacross the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining\na set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,\nsupporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full\nimage history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image\ndatasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies\non both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the\nhighest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all\ncomparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%\nacross three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior\nclustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it\nmaintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume\nincreases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries\nand supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous\nmarine exploration."}

Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and\nRGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence\non ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a\nnovel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,\nlow-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single\nsensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the\nwavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral\ninformation in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to\n$60\\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the\nspectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral\ncameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to\nRGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from\na Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image\nreconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using\nspectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no\nextra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy\nby over $30\\%$ compared to color-only method.

We\nconsider the case in which the cancer is \"diffuse\", dispersed such that there\nare multiple distinct cancer sites. We investigate the problem of a swarm of\nnanobots locating these sites and treating them by dropping drug payloads at\nthe sites. To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be\nallocated between sites according to their \"demands\"; this requires extra\nnanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the\nnanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement\nmodel for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in\nwhich bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients. We present three\nalgorithms: The first algorithm, called KM, is the most representative of\nreality, with agents simply following naturally existing chemical signals that\nsurround each cancer site. The second algorithm, KMA, includes an additional\nchemical payload which amplifies the existing natural signals. The third\nalgorithm, KMAR, includes another additional chemical payload which counteracts\nthe other signals, instead inducing negative chemotaxis in agents such that\nthey are repelled from sites that are already sufficiently treated. We present\nsimulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer\narrangements. For KM, we show that the treatment is generally successful unless\nthe natural chemical signals are weak, in which case the treatment progresses\ntoo slowly. For KMA, we demonstrate a significant improvement in treatment\nspeed but a drop in eventual success, except for concentrated cancer patterns.\nFor KMAR, our results show great performance across all types of cancer\npatterns, demonstrating robustness and adaptability."}

We evaluated whether the\nsocial interpretation of robotic gestures should also be considered when\nturning off a robot. In the experiment, participants engaged in a brief\npreliminary neutral interaction while a robotic arm showed interest in their\nactions. At the end of the task, participants were asked to turn off the\nrobotic arm under two conditions: (1) a Non-designed condition, where all of\nthe robot's engines were immediately and simultaneously turned off, as robots\ntypically shut down; (2) a Designed condition, where the robot's engines\ngradually folded inward in a motion resembling \"falling asleep.\" Our findings\nrevealed that all participants anthropomorphized the robot's movement when it\nwas turned off. In the Non-designed condition, most participants interpreted\nthe robot's turn-off movement negatively, as if the robot had \"died.\" In the\nDesigned condition, most participants interpreted it more neutrally, stating\nthat the robot \"went to sleep.\" The robot's turn-off movement also impacted its\nperception, leading to higher likeability, perceived intelligence, and animacy\nin the Designed condition.
