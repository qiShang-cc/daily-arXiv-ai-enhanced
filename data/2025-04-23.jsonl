Acoustic signals, for instance, are susceptible to noise\nfrom marine sources due to marine life and human activities. This is not the\ncase with optical signals. However, absorption and scattering significantly\nattenuate optical signals. This limits the communication range and requires\nhigher transmission power or more sensitive receivers to detect transmitted\nlight. Therefore, it is necessary to design underwater optical systems with a\nhigher transmission rate and reduced attenuation. To this end, we introduce a\nframework for designing optical signaling constellations employing\nmulti-wavelength light sources to account for the transmission distance and\nachievable rate. In particular, we redefine the color-shift keying (CSK)\nconstraint region to target blue light and adapt to marine environments. We\ndiscuss an example of 4-point underwater CSK. The corresponding analytical\nresults demonstrate the trade-offs between the symbol error probability,\nachievable rate, and transmission range of the proposed scheme."}

While IRS-aided\ncommunication systems can achieve attractive high channel gains, existing\nschemes require plenty of IRS elements to mitigate the ``multiplicative\nfading'' effect in cascaded channels, leading to high complexity for real-time\nbeamforming and high signaling overhead for channel estimation. In this paper,\nthe concept of sustainable intelligent element-grouping IRS (IEG-IRS) is\nproposed to overcome those fundamental bottlenecks. Specifically, based on the\nstatistical channel state information (S-CSI), the proposed grouping strategy\nintelligently pre-divide the IEG-IRS elements into multiple groups based on the\nbeam-domain grouping method, with each group sharing the common reflection\ncoefficient and being optimized in real time using the instantaneous channel\nstate information (I-CSI). Then, we further analyze the asymptotic performance\nof the IEG-IRS to reveal the substantial capacity gain in an extremely\nlarge-scale IRS (XL-IRS) aided single-user single-input single-output (SU-SISO)\nsystem. In particular, when a line-of-sight (LoS) component exists, it\ndemonstrates that the combined cascaded link can be considered as a\n``deterministic virtual LoS'' channel, resulting in a sustainable squared array\ngain achieved by the IEG-IRS. Finally, we formulate a weighted-sum-rate (WSR)\nmaximization problem for an IEG-IRS-aided multiuser multiple-input\nsingle-output (MU-MISO) system and a two-stage algorithm for optimizing the\nbeam-domain grouping strategy and the multi-user active-passive beamforming is\nproposed."}
