Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation\nmodel, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling\nflexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,\nRynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,\nobject segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a\nregion-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing\nfine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise\ninteractions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an\negocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data.\nFurthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for\nevaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will\nadvance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents\nand facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks.

Deep neural networks that perceive task-critical\ndetails from rich sensory signals have become ubiquitous; however, their\nblack-box behavior and sensitivity to environmental uncertainty and\ndistribution shifts make them challenging to verify formally. Abstraction-based\nverification techniques for vision-based autonomy produce safety guarantees\ncontingent on rigid assumptions, such as bounded errors or known unique\ndistributions. Such overly restrictive and inflexible assumptions limit the\nvalidity of the guarantees, especially in diverse and uncertain test-time\nenvironments. We propose a methodology that unifies the verification models of\nperception with their offline validation. Our methodology leverages interval\nMDPs and provides a flexible end-to-end guarantee that adapts directly to the\nout-of-distribution test-time conditions. We evaluate our methodology on a\nsynthetic perception Markov chain with well-defined state estimation\ndistributions and a mountain car benchmark. Our findings reveal that we can\nguarantee tight yet rigorous bounds on overall system safety."}

Existing approaches for this task rely\nsolely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the\nintrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and\nreduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose\nHRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose\nestimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud\nrepresentations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples\nobject pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately\nencoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a\ncontrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on\nour 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds\nfrom multiple categories by considering rotational and translational\ndifferences as well as categorical information. We further design pose\nestimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and\ntranslation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose\nsuccessfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25\nbenchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only\nstate-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness\nand potential for real-world applications.

Controllable motion generation\n(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code\nrepresentations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained\nmotion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method\nthat augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion\nfeatures using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the\ninterpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing\nsubtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on\nthe HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance\n(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.\nQualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes\nfurther confirms the model's controllability for motion editing."}

The proposed technique addresses the\nlimitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues\nlike equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By\ncombining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object\ndetection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D\nbounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and\nrotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to\nlocate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods\n(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image\ncoordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point\n(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to\nhomography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean\nAverage Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold\nof 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows\nthe creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a\npublicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box\nannotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This\ndataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In\naddition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for\nship detection from the same scene."}

To explore this\nfuture, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,\nand society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D\nscenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at\nscale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans\ndevelop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how\nintelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,\nVirtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator\nthat supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A\nlarge-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast\noutdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with\nrich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two\nnovel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent\nreasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to\nhelp agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The\nCommunity Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate\nin solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these\ntasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task\nplanning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community\nwill unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world\nenvironments."}
