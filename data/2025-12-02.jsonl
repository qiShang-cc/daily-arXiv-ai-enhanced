A poorly selected polynomial order results in over- or under-smoothing which shows as either bias or excessive noise at the output. In this study, we apply the N-fold cross-validation technique (also known as leave-one-out cross-validation) for model order selection and show that the inherent analytical structure of the SG filtering problem, mainly its minimum norm formulation, enables an efficient and effective order selection solution. More specifically, a novel connection between the total prediction error and SG-projection spaces is developed to reduce the implementation complexity of cross-validation method. The suggested solution compares favorably with the state-of-the-art Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) rule in non-asymptotic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sample size regimes.

Conventional wireless methods, however, often face limitations in accuracy, reliability, and coverage, especially in complex non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a key enabling technology, offering dynamic control over the radio propagation environment to overcome these challenges. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of RIS-aided localization and sensing, bridging fundamental theory with practical implementation. The core principles of the RIS technology are first described detailing how programmable metasurfaces can intelligently combat blockages, enhance signal diversity, and create virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links. The chapter then reviews a range of application scenarios where RISs can offer significant improvements. A significant portion of the chapter is dedicated to algorithmic methodologies, covering beam sweeping protocols, codebook-based techniques, and advanced optimization and machine learning strategies for both localization and sensing. To validate the theoretical concepts in real-world conditions, recent experimental results using an RIS prototype are detailed, showcasing the technology's efficacy and illustrating key performance trade-offs."}

In practical multiuser deployments, two considerations arise: the common stream decoding constraint imposed by the weakest user, and residual inter-user interference can remain non-negligible, particularly in single-input single-output (SISO) broadcast settings and under an imperfect CSIT scenario. Motivated by prior advances of RSMA research, we investigate a complementary mechanism-fluid antenna systems (FAS), with dynamic port reconfiguration supplies adaptive spatial selectivity without altering the RSMA signaling structure. Can FAS help alleviate these considerations and enhance RSMA performance? We develop a tractable correlation-aware analytical framework based on block-correlation models, including constant block correlation (CBC) and variable block correlation (VBC), to capture realistic spatial dependence among ports. Closed-form expressions are derived for outage probability (OP) and average capacity (AC), revealing how port reconfiguration strengthens the weakest effective channel and improves SINR through higher channel gains and lower relative noise impact. Monte Carlo simulations verify the analysis and show that VBC matches simulations more tightly than CBC across all port configurations. Finally, FAS-RSMA provides clear gains over conventional antenna systems and NOMA, achieving lower OP and higher AC by combining RSMA interference management with FAS spatial diversity."}

In this work, we address these challenges by introducing DREAMer-VXS, a model-based framework for Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) exploration that learns to plan from imagined latent trajectories. Our approach centers on learning a comprehensive world model from partial and high-dimensional LiDAR observations. This world model is composed of a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which learns a compact representation of the environment's structure, and a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM), which models complex temporal dynamics. By leveraging this learned model as a high-speed simulator, the agent can train its navigation policy almost entirely in imagination. This methodology decouples policy learning from real-world interaction, culminating in a 90% reduction in required environmental interactions to achieve expert-level performance when compared to state-of-the-art model-free SAC baselines. The agent's behavior is guided by an actor-critic policy optimized with a composite reward function that balances task objectives with an intrinsic curiosity bonus, promoting systematic exploration of unknown spaces. We demonstrate through extensive simulated experiments that DREAMer-VXS not only learns orders of magnitude faster but also develops more generalizable and robust policies, achieving a 45% increase in exploration efficiency in unseen environments and superior resilience to dynamic obstacles."}

The goal of this work was to classify the UAV and helicopters micro-Doppler spectrograms with different duration times, using the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture.

This survey offers a critical, structured review of SDTs. We clarify terminology and scope, propose a taxonomy by purpose, model fidelity, and data sources, and synthesize state-of-the-art achievements in deformable registration and tracking, real-time simulation and co-simulation, AR/VR guidance, edge-cloud orchestration, and AI for scene understanding and prediction.

When the emitter is deviated greatly from the normal direction of antenna element or is close to the null-point direction, the sensing energy by array will be seriously attenuated such that the direction-sensing performance is degraded significantly. To address such an issue, a rotatable array system is established with the directive antenna pattern of each element taken into account, where each element has the same antenna pattern. Then, the corresponding the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived. Finally, a recursive rotation Root-MUSIC (RR-Root-MUSIC) direction-sensing method is proposed and its mean-square-error (MSE) performance is evaluated by the derived CRLB. Simulation results show that the proposed rotation method converges rapidly with about ten iterations, and make a significant enhancement on the direction-sensing accuracy in terms of MSE when the target direction departs seriously far away from the normal vector of array. Compared with conventional Root-MUSIC, the sensing performance of the proposed RR-Root-MUSIC method is much closer to the CRLB."}

Prior planning methods, both traditional and generative, often struggle to incorporate high-level semantics with low-level constraints, especially the nexus between task configurations and motion controllability. In this work, we present XFlowMP, a task-conditioned generative motion planner that models robot trajectory evolution as entropic flows bridging stochastic noises and expert demonstrations via Schrodinger bridges given the inquiry task configuration. Specifically, our method leverages Schrodinger bridges as a conditional flow matching coupled with a score function to learn motion fields with high-order dynamics while encoding start-goal configurations, enabling the generation of collision-free and dynamically-feasible motions. Through evaluations, XFlowMP achieves up to 53.79% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 36.36% smoother motions, and 39.88% lower energy consumption while comparing to the next-best baseline on the RobotPointMass benchmark, and also reducing short-horizon planning time by 11.72%. On long-horizon motions in the LASA Handwriting dataset, our method maintains the trajectories with 1.26% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 3.96% smoother, and 31.97% lower energy.

A novel three-dimensional (3D) measurement procedure is proposed to capture comprehensive spatial characteristics, and its effectiveness in improving parameterization accuracy was verified using 28 GHz data. For parameterization, we developed a new method utilizing two dimensions of the high-bandwidth power delay profile-received power and delay spread-thereby fully leveraging the rich information provided by such measurements. Furthermore, we introduce the ER-BK hybrid model, which integrates the Beckmann-Kirchhoff (BK) model's high accuracy and cross-frequency adaptability with the Effective Roughness (ER) model's simplicity, applying it to the building surfaces. Our results show that diffuse scattering at 8 GHz and 12 GHz is highly similar, distinct from that at 28 GHz. A comparison revealed that the BK model provides a better fit for our FR3 measurement data. Crucially, we validated the angular generalization of the parameterized BK model using data from a different incident angle than the one used for fitting. The feasibility of the ER-BK hybrid model was also verified through simulation of the parameterized marble surface."}

Not Submitted to a conference", "summary": "With more devices competing for limited spectrum, dynamic spectrum sharing is increasingly vulnerable to interference from unauthorized emitters. This motivates fast detection and localization of these emitters using low-cost, distributed sensors that do not require precise time synchronization. This paper presents two convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches for multi-emitter detection and localization from sparsely sampled power maps. The first method performs single-stage prediction of existence probabilities and positions. The alternative two-stage method first estimates an occupancy map as an interpretable intermediate representation and then localizes emitters. A unified training objective combines binary cross entropy with coordinate regression loss and can handle an unknown emitter count. Small footprint networks, on the order of 70\\,k parameters, are trained and evaluated on simulated free-space and urban scenes. Experiments demonstrate that both approaches localize multiple emitters from sparse measurements across diverse environments, with the logits based two-stage variant remaining competitive, and in some cases superior, under extreme sensor sparsity. The findings indicate that small CNNs with a unified objective can be deployed for spectrum monitoring and localization."}

To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph-guided Clustering Mixture-of-Experts CNN-GRU (GCMCG), a novel unified framework for MI-ME EEG decoding. Our approach integrates a robust preprocessing stage using Independent Component Analysis and Wavelet Transform (ICA-WT) for effective denoising.

We extend single-user learned feedback codes for the AWGN channel to the broadcast setting, and compare their performance with existing analytical codes, as well as a newly proposed analytical scheme inspired by the learned schemes. Our results show that, for a fixed code rate, learned codes outperform analytical codes at the same blocklength by using power-efficient nonlinear structures and are more robust to feedback noise.

This letter introduces three deterministic pruning rules that exploit QAM-grid symmetry and relative displacement between the ZF estimate and the nearby QAM points to eliminate unlikely branches, avoiding metric sorting and reducing full metric distance calculations. Simulations show large complexity savings with only a small impact on error performance. The resulting detector preserves QAM-order independence, scales to larger MIMO sizes, and maps naturally to parallel hardware implementation."}

These issues are particularly problematic in drone applications where robust and accurate state estimation is critical for safe autonomous operation. In this work, we present ICD-Net, a novel framework that enhances visual-inertial SLAM performance by learning to process raw inertial measurements and generating displacement estimates with associated uncertainty quantification. Rather than relying on analytical inertial sensor models that struggle with real-world sensor imperfections, our method directly extracts displacement maps from sensor data while simultaneously predicting measurement covariances that reflect estimation confidence. We integrate ICD-Net outputs as additional residual constraints into the VINS-Fusion optimization framework, where the predicted uncertainties appropriately weight the neural network contributions relative to traditional visual and inertial terms. The learned displacement constraints provide complementary information that compensates for various error sources in the SLAM pipeline. Our approach can be used under both normal operating conditions and in situations of camera inconsistency or visual degradation. Experimental evaluation on challenging high-speed drone sequences demonstrated that our approach significantly improved trajectory estimation accuracy compared to standard VINS-Fusion, with more than 38% improvement in mean APE and uncertainty estimates proving crucial for maintaining system robustness. Our method shows that neural network enhancement can effectively address multiple sources of SLAM degradation while maintaining real-time performance requirements."}

(ii) What level of position resolution is needed for accurate near-field beam focusing? (iii) How frequently must channel state information be updated to maintain highly directive bweamforming in dynamic scenarios? We develop an analytical framework for assessing near-field beamforming gain degradation due to mismatches between the focusing point and the coordinates of a user. Closed-form expressions for beam correlation, beam sensitivity to user movement, and the direction of fastest beamforming gain degradation are derived. A dynamic polar coordinate grid is also proposed for low complexity and adaptive near-field beam search. Furthermore, we introduce the novel concept of beam coherence time, quantifying the temporal robustness of focused beams and enabling proactive sensing-aided beam tracking strategies.

Prior image imagination based VLN work shows benefits for discrete panoramas but lacks online, action-conditioned predictions and does not produce explicit planning values; moreover, many methods replace the planner with long-horizon objectives that are brittle and slow. To bridge this gap, we propose VISTAv2, a generative world model that rolls out egocentric future views conditioned on past observations, candidate action sequences, and instructions, and projects them into an online value map for planning. Unlike prior approaches, VISTAv2 does not replace the planner. The online value map is fused at score level with the base objective, providing reachability and risk-aware guidance. Concretely, we employ an action-aware Conditional Diffusion Transformer video predictor to synthesize short-horizon futures, align them with the natural language instruction via a vision-language scorer, and fuse multiple rollouts in a differentiable imagination-to-value head to output an imagined egocentric value map. For efficiency, rollouts occur in VAE latent space with a distilled sampler and sparse decoding, enabling inference on a single consumer GPU. Evaluated on MP3D and RoboTHOR, VISTAv2 improves over strong baselines, and ablations show that action-conditioned imagination, instruction-guided value fusion, and the online value-map planner are all critical, suggesting that VISTAv2 offers a practical and interpretable route to robust VLN."}

The content delivery tenant needs to guarantee that each of its clients (users) receives the required content, the sensing tenant aims to gather an adequate amount of uncorrelated data, and the MEC tenant provides computing service to its clients. An energy consumption minimization framework is considered to meet the tenants' requirements by optimizing the number of deployed UAVs, the deployment location of each UAV, the transmit power of each deployed UAV, the user-UAV association, and the transmission power as well as the computing resources of each UAV. Taking into account the spatial correlation among the sensing users, a subset of these users is activated to gather the required sensing information. A solution approach technique inherited from graph theory is presented, in which the Lagrange approach derives the transmission power and computing resource allocation expressions.

In this work, we present a novel framework called Causal structure-aware Reinforcement Learning (CRL) that explicitly integrates causal discovery and reasoning into policy optimization. This method enables an agent to learn and exploit a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that describes the causal dependencies between human behavioral states and robot actions, facilitating more efficient, interpretable, and robust decision-making. We validate our approach in a simulated robot-assisted cognitive care scenario, where the agent interacts with a virtual patient exhibiting dynamic emotional, cognitive, and engagement states. The experimental results show that CRL agents outperform conventional model-free RL baselines by achieving higher cumulative rewards, maintaining desirable patient states more consistently, and exhibiting interpretable, clinically-aligned behavior. We further demonstrate that CRL's performance advantage remains robust across different weighting strategies and hyperparameter settings. In addition, we demonstrate a lightweight LLM-based deployment: a fixed policy is embedded into a system prompt that maps inferred states to actions, producing consistent, supportive dialogue without LLM finetuning. Our work illustrates the promise of causal reinforcement learning for human-robot interaction applications, where interpretability, adaptiveness, and data efficiency are paramount."}

Existing 3GPP-style models are often specified at discrete frequencies, introducing discontinuities in large-scale parameters (LSPs) at the 7.125 GHz boundary. To address this, we develop a unified framework anchored by rigorous double-directional measurements at 4.85 GHz in three representative UMa/UMi layouts. We derive route-specific statistics for path loss, delay and angular spreads, K-factor, and spatial consistency using robust distance-binning and bootstrap processing. Subsequently, we construct a log-log frequency-continuous LSP model spanning 4.85 to 28 GHz by anchoring these local statistics to complementary high-frequency datasets. The resulting models ensure smoothness across 7.125 GHz and systematically deviate from 3GPP trends, capturing weaker dispersion in urban macrocells (UMa) and stronger frequency-dependent compaction in urban microcells (UMi). The proposed parameter set fills the measurement gap around 4.85 GHz and provides a practical, implementation-ready basis for wideband 5G/6G simulations, mobility evaluation, and spectrum-planning activities across the FR1--FR3 interface."}

This survey offers a comprehensive overview of DRL-based approaches to socially aware navigation, highlighting key aspects such as proxemics, human comfort, naturalness, trajectory and intention prediction, which enhance robot interaction in human environments. This work critically analyzes the integration of value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms alongside neural network architectures, such as feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, graph, and transformer networks, for enhancing agent learning and representation in socially aware navigation. Furthermore, we examine crucial evaluation mechanisms, including metrics, benchmark datasets, simulation environments, and the persistent challenges of sim-to-real transfer. Our comparative analysis of the literature reveals that while DRL significantly improves safety, and human acceptance over traditional approaches, the field still faces setback due to non-uniform evaluation mechanisms, absence of standardized social metrics, computational burdens that limit scalability, and difficulty in transferring simulation to real robotic hardware applications. We assert that future progress will depend on hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of multiple approaches and producing benchmarks that balance technical efficiency with human-centered evaluation."}

To demonstrate the capability of PDNN, we propose a PDNN-based space-shift-keying (PDNN-SSK) communication system with a single radio-frequency (RF) chain and a maximum power detector. In this system, PDNNs are deployed at both the transmitter and receiver to jointly execute modulation, beamforming, and detection. We conduct theoretical analyses to provide the maximization condition of correct detection probability and derive the closed-form expression of the symbol error rate (SER) for the proposed system. To approach these theoretical benchmarks, the phase shift parameters of PDNNs are optimized using a surrogate model-based training approach, which effectively navigates the high-dimensional, non-convex optimization landscape. Extensive simulations verify the theoretical analysis framework and uncover fundamental design principles for the PDNN architecture, highlighting its potential to revolutionize RF front-ends by replacing conventional digital baseband modules with this integrable RF computing platform."}

To address this limitation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, enabling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned reinforcement learning in interactive robotics."}

The selected beams feed a sparse beamspace Unitary ESPRIT stage, so that the overall complexity is dominated by a single low-dimensional ESPRIT call while retaining a large effective aperture.

Most existing systems only allow all agents to move synchronously, limiting their use in applications that require differentiated actuation. This research aims to design a controller capable of regulating the radial distance between micro-agents using only the angle ψof a global magnetic field as the actuation parameter, demonstrating potential for practical applications. The proposed cascade control approach enables faster and more precise adjustment of the inter-agent distance than a proportional controller, while maintaining smooth transitions and avoiding abrupt changes in the orientation of the magnetic field, making it suitable for real-world implementation. A bibliographic review was conducted to develop the physical model, considering magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and velocities in viscous media. A PID controller was implemented to regulate the radial distance, followed by a PD controller in cascade to smooth changes in field orientation. These controllers were simulated in MATLAB, showing that the PID controller reduced convergence time to the desired radius by about 40%. When adding the second controller, the combined PID+PD scheme achieved smooth angular trajectories within similar timeframes, with fluctuations of only \\pm 5^\\circ. These results validate the feasibility of controlling the radial distance of two microrobots using a shared magnetic field in a fast and precise manner, without abrupt variations in the control angle. However, the model is limited to a 2D environment and two agents, suggesting future research to extend the controller to 3D systems and multiple agents."}

Most MC literature focuses on particle properties, even though many natural phenomena exhibit wave-like behavior. One such signal is sound waves. Understanding how sound waves are used in nature can help us better utilize this signal in our interactions with our environment. To take a step in this direction, in this paper, we examine how plants process incoming sound waves and take informed actions. Indeed, plants respond to sound, yet no quantitative communication-theoretic model currently explains this behavior. This study develops the first end-to-end acoustic communication framework for plants. The model is formed following the biological steps of the incoming signal, and a mathematical description is constructed at each step following basic biological models. The resulting end-to-end communication-theoretic model is analyzed using MATLAB. Simulations show that a $200$ $Hz$, $20$ $mu Pa$ stimulus elevates cytosolic $Ca^{2+}$ from $150$ $nM$ to $230 \\pm 10$ $nM$ within $50$ seconds which can cause root bending in plants in the long run.

While multi-robot systems offer promising solutions to address labor shortages and rising costs, the efficient scheduling of these systems presents complex optimization challenges. This research investigates the multi-trip picking robot task scheduling (MTPRTS) problem. The problem is characterized by its provision for robot redeployment while maintaining strict adherence to makespan constraints, and encompasses the interdependencies among robot weight, robot load, and energy consumption, thus introducing substantial computational challenges that demand sophisticated optimization algorithms.To effectively tackle this complexity, metaheuristic approaches, which often utilize local search mechanisms, are widely employed. Despite the critical role of local search in vehicle routing problems, most existing algorithms are hampered by redundant local operations, leading to slower search processes and higher risks of local optima, particularly in large-scale scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive experience-based discrete genetic algorithm (AEDGA) that introduces three key innovations: (1) integrated load-distance balancing initialization method, (2) a clustering-based local search mechanism, and (3) an experience-based adaptive selection strategy. To ensure solution feasibility under makespan constraints, we develop a solution repair strategy implemented through three distinct frameworks. Comprehensive experiments on 18 proposed test instances and 24 existing test problems demonstrate that AEDGA significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art algorithms."}

Radio frequency ISAC (RF-ISAC) is constrained by spectrum crowding, limited sensing resolution, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. In contrast, optical ISAC (O-ISAC) leverages the large bandwidth and short wavelength of optical carriers and is regarded as an important complement to RF-ISAC. However, conventional O-ISAC relies on natural optical reflections from target surfaces, which generate weak echoes that are highly dependent on surface materials, thereby limiting the achievable sensing range and sensing accuracy. This article introduces retroreflective optical ISAC (RO-ISAC), which alleviates these limitations by equipping targets with compact retroreflective modules. These modules return incident light approximately back to the source over a useful range of incidence angles, forming a well controlled double pass optical path with strong and stable echoes, and thereby further unlocking the application potential of O-ISAC. The conceptual architecture of RO-ISAC is presented together with the underlying retroreflection mechanism. Key enabling technologies for RO-ISAC systems are discussed, including channel modeling, waveform design, bidirectional transmission, and multi-target sensing and communication, with representative details and experimental validation.

This work targets per-cell per-beam radio mapping from 5G new radio (NR) synchronization signal (SS) burst sets. Conventional processing treats interference as noise and focuses on the strongest link, which is insufficient to comprehensive awareness of the radio environment and ineffective in dense multi-cell low-altitude scenarios. We propose a successive waveform reconstruction and cancellation framework that iteratively estimates, reconstructs, and subtracts the SSs of stronger BSs, thereby enabling reliable detection and estimation of ultra-weak signals. To support this, we introduce the notion of a carrier frequency offset (CFO)-coherent block within which a common-CFO/per-synchronization signal block (SSB)-channel model holds and design a joint CFO-channel estimator that coherently aggregates multiple SSBs within each CFO-coherent block. We further derive closed-form scaling laws that relate estimation accuracy to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) speed, motion geometry, burst periodicity, and the length of the CFO-coherent block. Simulations show that the proposed framework can detect and estimate SSs at signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) levels down to -30 dB. Field tests at 150 m altitude demonstrate per-beam coverage maps for more than ten overlapping BSs and reveal that, despite strong received power, the measured SINR rarely exceeds 10 dB, underscoring the need for careful interference management in low-altitude airspace."}

We attribute this gap to two factors: the lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and the unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction. We introduce AFRO, a self-supervised framework that learns dynamics-aware 3D representations without action or reconstruction supervision. AFRO casts state prediction as a generative diffusion process and jointly models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space to capture causal transition structure. To prevent feature leakage in action learning, we employ feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision, improving the quality and stability of visual features. When combined with Diffusion Policy, AFRO substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforming existing pre-training approaches. The framework also scales favorably with data volume and task complexity. Qualitative visualizations indicate that AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics.

While the application of Transformers to communication systems is a burgeoning field, the notion of context within physical waveforms remains under-explored. This paper addresses that gap by re-examining inter-symbol contribution (ISC) caused by pulse-shaping overlap. Rather than treating ISC as a nuisance, we view it as a deterministic source of contextual information embedded in oversampled complex baseband signals. We propose Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), a framework for the physical (PHY) layer inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers methodology. In MSM, a subset of symbol aligned samples is randomly masked, and a Transformer predicts the missing symbol identifiers using the surrounding \"in-between\" samples. Through this objective, the model learns the latent syntax of complex baseband waveforms. We illustrate MSM's potential by applying it to the task of demodulating signals corrupted by impulsive noise, where the model infers corrupted segments by leveraging the learned context. Our results suggest a path toward receivers that interpret, rather than merely detect communication signals, opening new avenues for context-aware PHY layer design."}

Arcadia delivers consistent gains on navigation and manipulation benchmarks and transfers robustly to physical robots, indicating that a tightly coupled lifecycle: continuous real-world data acquisition, generative simulation update, and shared-representation learning, supports lifelong improvement and end-to-end generalization.

This thesis addresses this issue by designing a novel hierarchical control architecture to improve humanoid locomotion stability with SLs. The core of this framework is a decoupled strategy that combines learning-based locomotion with model-based balancing. The low-level component consists of a walking gait for a Unitree H1 humanoid through imitation learning and curriculum learning. The high-level component actively utilizes the SLs for dynamic balancing. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated in a physics-based simulation under three conditions: baseline gait for an unladen humanoid (baseline walking), walking with a static SL payload (static payload), and walking with the active dynamic balancing controller (dynamic balancing). Our evaluation shows that the dynamic balancing controller improves stability. Compared to the static payload condition, the balancing strategy yields a gait pattern closer to the baseline and decreases the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of the CoM trajectory by 47\\%. The balancing controller also improves the re-stabilization within gait cycles and achieves a more coordinated anti-phase pattern of Ground Reaction Forces (GRF). The results demonstrate that a decoupled, hierarchical design can effectively mitigate the internal dynamic disturbances arising from the mass and movement of the SLs, enabling stable locomotion for humanoids equipped with functional limbs.

Radio map is a spatial representation of signal characteristics across different locations in a given area, which serves as a key tool for enabling precise spectrum management. To generate accurate radio maps, extensive research efforts have been made. However, most existing studies are conducted on simulation data, which differs significantly from real-world data and cannot accurately reflect the spectrum characteristics of practical environments. To tackle this problem, we construct a dataset of real-world radio map with a self-developed measurement system. Due to the limited volume of real-world data and the distributional discrepancies between simulation and real-world data, we propose a Pixel Transformer (PiT)- based model enhanced with the test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, named RadioPiT, for real-world radio map generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RadioPiT significantly outperforms baseline methods in real-world scenarios, yielding a 21.9% decrement in the root mean square error (RMSE) compared to RadioUNet."}

To enhance representation quality for effective policy generation, we implement two complementary constraints on the latent space: (1) a forward dynamics model that promotes state transition predictability, and (2) a distance-based constraint ensuring monotonic progression toward goal states. We evaluate our method on a comprehensive suite of manipulation tasks with varying environmental randomization.

We first study the transceiver without any hardware impairments and explore the integration of transformer-based ICL with DeepJSCC in both open-loop and closed-loop MIMO systems, depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transceiver. For both open-loop and closed-loop scenarios, we propose two MIMO transceiver architectures that leverage context information, i.e., pilot sequences and their outputs, as additional inputs, enabling the DeepJSCC encoder, DeepJSCC decoder, and the ICL denoiser to jointly learn encoding, decoding, and estimation strategies tailored to each channel realization. Next, we extend our study to a more challenging scenario where the transceiver suffers from in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance, resulting in nonlinear MIMO estimation. In this case, the context information is also exploited, facilitating joint learning across the DeepJSCC encoder, decoder, and the ICL denoiser under hardware impairments and varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that the ICL denoiser for MIMO estimation significantly outperforms the conventional least-squares method, with even greater advantages under IQ imbalance. Moreover, the proposed transformer-based ICL framework, integrated with contextual information, achieves significant improvements in end-to-end image reconstruction quality under transceiver IQ imbalance."}

However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches use static fusion strategies that treat all modalities equally and cannot adapt to channel heterogeneity or time-varying modality reliability in dynamic low-altitude environments. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for multimodal ISAC in LAWNs. Each modality is processed by a dedicated expert network, and a lightweight gating module adaptively assigns fusion weights according to the instantaneous informativeness and reliability of each modality. To improve scalability under the stringent energy constraints of aerial platforms, we further develop a sparse MoE variant that selectively activates only a subset of experts, thereby reducing computation overhead while preserving the benefits of adaptive fusion.

Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy."}

Notably, this work represents the first application of a programmable MZI photonic computing chip to robotic continuous control tasks, attaining an energy efficiency of 1.39 TOPS/W and an ultralow computational latency of 120 ps. Such performance underscores the promise of photonic spiking RL for real-time decision-making in autonomous and industrial robotic systems."}

To address these challenges, we propose a digital twin aided codebook learning framework, where a site-specific digital twin is leveraged to generate synthetic channel data for codebook learning. We also propose to learn separate codebooks for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight users, leveraging the geometric information provided by the digital twin. Simulation results demonstrate that the codebook learned from the digital twin can adapt to the environment geometry and user distribution, leading to high received signal-to-noise ratio performance.

However, expert action labeling often dominates the cost, especially in GPU-intensive simulators, human-in-the-loop settings, and robot fleets that revisit near-duplicate states. We present Conformalized Rejection Sampling for Active Imitation Learning (CRSAIL), a querying rule that requests an expert action only when the visited state is under-represented in the expert-labeled dataset. CRSAIL scores state novelty by the distance to the $K$-th nearest expert state and sets a single global threshold via conformal prediction. This threshold is the empirical $(1-α)$ quantile of on-policy calibration scores, providing a distribution-free calibration rule that links $α$ to the expected query rate and makes $α$ a task-agnostic tuning knob. This state-space querying strategy is robust to outliers and, unlike safety-gate-based AIL, can be run without real-time expert takeovers: we roll out full trajectories (episodes) with the learner and only afterward query the expert on a subset of visited states. Evaluated on MuJoCo robotics tasks, CRSAIL matches or exceeds expert-level reward while reducing total expert queries by up to 96% vs. DAgger and up to 65% vs. prior AIL methods, with empirical robustness to $α$ and $K$, easing deployment on novel systems with unknown dynamics."}

Fast polynomial modular multiplication and fast pointwise multiplication problems are important for cryptosystem applications such as post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic encryption.

We further introduce a fine-grained feature distillation mechanism to guide a better interaction and fusion between the high-level semantic planning space and the vectorized scene context.

In this tutorial paper, we outline the main architectural design principles behind fully digital neuromorphic processors and illustrate them using the SENECA platform as a running example. Starting from a flexible array of tiny RISC-V processing cores connected by a simple Network-on-Chip (NoC), we show how to progressively evolve the architecture: from a baseline event-driven implementation of fully connected networks, to versions with dedicated Neural Processing Elements (NPEs) and a loop controller that offloads fine-grained control from the general-purpose cores. Along the way, we discuss software and mapping techniques such as spike grouping, event-driven depth-first convolution for convolutional networks, and hard-attention style processing for high-resolution event-based vision. The focus is on architectural trade-offs, performance and energy bottlenecks, and on leveraging flexibility to incrementally add domain-specific acceleration. This paper assumes familiarity with basic neuromorphic concepts (spikes, event-driven computation, sparse activation) and deep neural network workloads.

These challenges arise in many robotics domains, from urban driving and warehouse automation to defense and surveillance. Classical path planning approaches and memoryless reinforcement learning often fail under limited fields of view (FoVs) and occlusions, committing to unsafe or inefficient maneuvers. We propose a hierarchical navigation framework that integrates a Deep Transformer Q-Network (DTQN) as a high-level subgoal selector with a modular low-level controller for waypoint execution. The DTQN consumes short histories of task-aware features, encoding odometry, goal direction, obstacle proximity, and visibility cues, and outputs Q-values to rank candidate subgoals. Visibility-aware candidate generation introduces masking and exposure penalties, rewarding the use of cover and anticipatory safety. A low-level potential field controller then tracks the selected subgoal, ensuring smooth short-horizon obstacle avoidance. We validate our approach in 2D simulation and extend it directly to a 3D Unity-ROS environment by projecting point-cloud perception into the same feature schema, enabling transfer without architectural changes. Results show consistent improvements over classical planners and RL baselines in success rate, safety margins, and time to goal, with ablations confirming the value of temporal memory and visibility-aware candidate design. These findings highlight a generalizable framework for safe navigation under uncertainty, with broad relevance across robotic platforms."}

In contrast, floating-point numbers offer a larger dynamic range at the cost of increased hardware complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel number format called variable-point (VP). VP numbers cover a larger dynamic range than fixed-point numbers with similar bitwidth, without notably increasing hardware complexity -- this allows for a more efficient representation of signals with high dynamic range. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed VP number format, we consider a matrix-vector multiplication engine for spatial equalization in multi-antenna wireless communication systems involving high-dynamic-range signals. Through post-layout VLSI implementation results, we demonstrate that the proposed VP-based design achieves 20% and 10% area and power savings, respectively, compared to a fully optimized fixed-point design, without incurring any noticeable performance degradation."}

With the growing prevalence of near-field propagation at ultra-high frequencies, this paper focuses on the application of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) MA arrays for near-field sensing to jointly estimate the angle and distance information about a target. First, for the 1D MA array scenario, to gain insights into MA-enhanced near-field sensing, we investigate two simplified cases with only angle-of-arrival (AoA) or distance estimation, respectively, assuming that the other information is already known. The worst-case Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) on the mean square errors (MSEs) of the AoA estimation and the distance estimation are derived in these two cases. Then, we jointly optimize the positions of the MAs within the 1D array to minimize these CRBs and derive their closed-form solutions, which yield an identical array geometry to MA-enhanced far-field sensing. For the more challenging joint AoA and distance estimation, since the associated worst-case CRB is a highly complex and non-convex function with respect to the MA positions, a discrete sampling-based approach is proposed to sequentially update the MA positions and obtain an efficient suboptimal solution. Furthermore, we investigate the worst-case CRB minimization problems for a 2D MA array under various conditions and extend our proposed algorithms to solve them efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced near-field sensing scheme dramatically outperforms conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Moreover, the joint angle and distance estimation results in a different array geometry from that in the individual estimation of angle/distance or far-field sensing."}

We construct a morphology-informed graph neural architecture that is provably equivariant with respect to the robot's morphological symmetry group actions, ensuring consistent policy responses under symmetric states while maintaining invariance in value estimation. This design eliminates the need for tedious reward shaping or costly data augmentation, which are typically required to enforce symmetry.

The proposed approach addresses the computational bottleneck inherent in solving large-scale Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by introducing a two-stage decomposition strategy. In the first stage, a factor-based algorithm partitions the global MDP into smaller, goal-specific sub-MDPs by leveraging domain-specific features such as goal priority, fault states, spatial layout, and energy constraints. In the second stage, a priority-based recombination algorithm solves each sub-MDP independently and integrates the results into a unified global policy using a meta-policy for conflict resolution.

A multiphysics simulation framework models this coupling, and a neural-network-based decoupling strategy removes the parasitic component, restoring sensing fidelity.

However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs."}

One of the key barriers is the lack of motion planning algorithms that can provide verifiable guarantees for safety, efficiency and reliability. To address this, a family of algorithms called Constant-Time Motion Planning (CTMP) was introduced, which leverages a preprocessing phase to enable collision-free motion queries in a fixed, user-specified time budget (e.g., 10 milliseconds). However, existing CTMP methods do not explicitly incorporate the manipulation behaviors essential for object handling. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \\textit{Behavioral Constant-Time Motion Planner} (B-CTMP), an algorithm that extends CTMP to solve a broad class of two-step manipulation tasks: (1) a collision-free motion to a behavior initiation state, followed by (2) execution of a manipulation behavior (such as grasping or insertion) to reach the goal. By precomputing compact data structures, B-CTMP guarantees constant-time query in mere milliseconds while ensuring completeness and successful task execution over a specified set of states. We evaluate B-CTMP on two canonical manipulation tasks in simulation, shelf picking and plug insertion,and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real robot. Our results show that B-CTMP unifies collision-free planning and object manipulation within a single constant-time framework, providing provable guarantees of speed and success for manipulation in semi-structured environments."}

To address this challenge, we introduce H-Zero, a cross-humanoid locomotion pretraining pipeline that learns a generalizable humanoid base policy. We show that pretraining on a limited set of embodiments enables zero-shot and few-shot transfer to novel humanoid robots with minimal fine-tuning. Evaluations show that the pretrained policy maintains up to 81% of the full episode duration on unseen robots in simulation while enabling few-shot transfer to unseen humanoids and upright quadrupeds within 30 minutes of fine-tuning."}

Traditional sensing modalities such as visual cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) fail in environments with poor visibility due to darkness, smoke, or reflective surfaces. In these visioned-impaired conditions, UWB radar offers a promising alternative. To this end, this work explores the suitability of robot-mounted UWB radar for environmental mapping in dynamic, anchor-free scenarios. The study investigates how different materials (metal, concrete and plywood) and UWB radio channels (5 and 9) influence the Channel Impulse Response (CIR). Furthermore, a processing pipeline is proposed to achieve reliable mapping of detected obstacles, consisting of 3 steps: (i) target identification (based on CIR peak detection), (ii) filtering (based on peak properties, signal-to-noise score, and phase-difference of arrival), and (iii) clustering (based on distance estimation and angle-of-arrival estimation). The proposed approach successfully reduces noise and multipath effects, resulting in an obstacle detection precision of at least 82.36% and a recall of 89.46% on channel 9 even when detecting low-reflective materials such as plywood. This work offers a foundation for further development of UWB-based localisation and mapping (SLAM) systems that do not rely on visual features and, unlike conventional UWB localisation systems, do not require on fixed anchor nodes for triangulation."}

These tasks are crucial in daily life, such as shaking a bottle or knocking a nail. However, few prior works have explored this task, leading to two main challenges: 1) the imitation methods often fail to complete these tasks within the expected terminal time due to the ineffective utilization of history; 2) the absence of a benchmark with sufficient data and automatic evaluation tools hinders development of effective solutions in this area. To address these challenges, we first propose the CycleManip framework to achieve cycle-based task manipulation in an end-to-end imitation manner without requiring any extra models, hierarchical structure or significant computational overhead. The core insight is to enhance effective history perception by a cost-aware sampling strategy and to improve historical understanding by multi-task learning. Second, we introduce a cycle-based task manipulation benchmark, which provides diverse cycle-based tasks, and an automatic evaluation method. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method achieves high success rates in cycle-based task manipulation. The results further show strong adaptability performance in general manipulation, and the plug-and-play ability on imitation policies such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

This research aims to develop an autonomous grasping system on a quadruped robot using a task-level interaction approach. The system includes hardware integration of a robotic arm and gripper onto the quadruped robot's body, a layered control system designed using ROS, and a web-based interface for human-robot interaction.

Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to \"privileged\" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy.

While single-drone tracking systems have been extensively studied, swarm-based target tracking remains underexplored, despite its unique advantages of distributed perception, fault-tolerant redundancy, and multidirectional target coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel decentralized LiDAR-based swarm tracking framework that enables visibility-aware, cooperative target tracking in complex environments, while fully harnessing the unique capabilities of swarm systems. To address visibility, we introduce a novel Spherical Signed Distance Field (SSDF)-based metric for 3-D environmental occlusion representation, coupled with an efficient algorithm that enables real-time onboard SSDF updating. A general Field-of-View (FOV) alignment cost supporting heterogeneous LiDAR configurations is proposed for consistent target observation. Swarm coordination is enhanced through cooperative costs that enforce inter-robot safe clearance, prevent mutual occlusions, and notably facilitate 3-D multidirectional target encirclement via a novel electrostatic-potential-inspired distribution metric. These innovations are integrated into a hierarchical planner, combining a kinodynamic front-end searcher with a spatiotemporal $SE(3)$ back-end optimizer to generate collision-free, visibility-optimized trajectories.Deployed on heterogeneous LiDAR swarms, our fully decentralized implementation features collaborative perception, distributed planning, and dynamic swarm reconfigurability.

This challenge is particularly pronounced for objects made of glass, metal, or other materials whose transparent or reflective surfaces introduce severe out-of-distribution variations. Existing approaches either rely on simulated materials in simulators and perform sim-to-real transfer, which is hindered by substantial visual domain gaps, or depend on collecting extensive real-world demonstrations, which is costly, time-consuming, and still insufficient to cover various materials. To overcome these limitations, we resort to computational photography and introduce Mutable Material Manipulation Augmentation (M$^3$A), a unified framework that leverages the physical characteristics of materials as captured by light transport for photometric re-rendering. The core idea is simple yet powerful: given a single real-world demonstration, we photometrically re-render the scene to generate a diverse set of highly realistic demonstrations with different material properties. This augmentation effectively decouples task-specific manipulation skills from surface appearance, enabling policies to generalize across materials without additional data collection. To systematically evaluate this capability, we construct the first comprehensive multi-material manipulation benchmark spanning both simulation and real-world environments. Extensive experiments show that the M$^3$A policy significantly enhances cross-material generalization, improving the average success rate across three real-world tasks by 58.03\\%, and demonstrating robust performance on previously unseen materials."}

Our approach empowers a single VLM to concurrently perform planning and predictive foresight. Conditioned on the full instruction and historical observations, the model is trained to understand the navigation instructions by decomposing the task, tracking its progress, and formulating the subsequent sub-goal. Simultaneously, it functions as a generative world model, providing crucial foresight by predicting short-term environmental dynamics and long-term navigation milestones. The VLM's structured plan guides its targeted prediction, while the imagined future provides rich context to inform the navigation actions, creating a powerful internal feedback loop of perception-planning/prediction-action. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmark that NavForesee achieves highly competitive performance in complex scenarios. Our work highlights the immense potential of fusing explicit language planning with implicit spatiotemporal prediction, paving the way for more intelligent and capable embodied agents."}

This paper proposes a novel one-key calibration framework named L2M-Calib for a fused magnetic-LiDAR system, jointly estimating the extrinsic transformation between the two kinds of sensors and the intrinsic distortion parameters of the magnetic sensors. Magnetic sensors capture ambient magnetic field (AMF) patterns, which are invariant to geometry, texture, illumination, and weather, making them suitable for challenging environments. Nonetheless, the integration of magnetic sensing into multimodal systems remains underexplored due to the absence of effective calibration techniques. To address this, we optimize extrinsic parameters using an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme, coupled with the intrinsic calibration as a weighted ridge-regularized total least squares (w-RRTLS) problem, ensuring robustness against measurement noise and ill-conditioned data. Extensive evaluations on both simulated datasets and real-world experiments, including AGV-mounted sensor configurations, demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy and robustness under various environmental and operational conditions."}

Established YCB and NIST benchmarks quantify grasp success, force, or timing on a single platform, but do not evaluate cross-embodiment transferability or energy-aware performance, capabilities essential for modern mobile and aerial manipulation. This letter introduces the Cross-Embodiment Gripper Benchmark (CEGB), a compact and reproducible benchmarking suite extending YCB and selected NIST metrics with three additional components: a transfer-time benchmark measuring the practical effort required to exchange embodiments, an energy-consumption benchmark evaluating grasping and holding efficiency, and an intent-specific ideal payload assessment reflecting design-dependent operational capability. Together, these metrics characterize both grasp performance and the suitability of reusing a single gripper across heterogeneous robotic systems. A lightweight self-locking gripper prototype is implemented as a reference case. Experiments demonstrate rapid embodiment transfer (median ~= 17.6 s across user groups), low holding energy for gripper prototype (~= 1.5 J per 10 s), and consistent grasp performance with cycle times of 3.2 - 3.9 s and success rates exceeding 90%. CEGB thus provides a reproducible foundation for cross-platform, energy-aware evaluation of grippers in aerial and manipulators domains."}

Firstly, the DLGP-CBF leverages a logarithmic transformation of GP regression to generate smooth and informative barrier values and gradients, even in sparse-data regions. Secondly, by explicitly modeling the DLGP-CBF as a function of obstacle positions, the derived safety constraint integrates predicted obstacle velocities, allowing the controller to proactively respond to dynamic obstacles' motion. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in obstacle avoidance performance, including increased safety margins, smoother trajectories, and enhanced responsiveness compared to baseline methods."}

However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data."}

However, on-robot data collection is labor-intensive and often limited to specific environments. In contrast, open-world images capture a vast diversity of real-world scenes that naturally align with robotic manipulation tasks, offering a promising avenue for low-cost, large-scale robot data acquisition. Despite this potential, the lack of associated robot actions hinders the practical use of open-world images for robot learning, leaving this rich visual resource largely unexploited. To bridge this gap, we propose IGen, a framework that scalably generates realistic visual observations and executable actions from open-world images. IGen first converts unstructured 2D pixels into structured 3D scene representations suitable for scene understanding and manipulation. It then leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to transform scene-specific task instructions into high-level plans and generate low-level actions as SE(3) end-effector pose sequences. From these poses, it synthesizes dynamic scene evolution and renders temporally coherent visual observations. Experiments validate the high quality of visuomotor data generated by IGen, and show that policies trained solely on IGen-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data. This highlights the potential of IGen to support scalable data generation from open-world images for generalist robotic policy training."}

Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundations models to specialize into reliable real-world experts."}

There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model.

To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks."}

However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI."}

While robust in predefined sections, this design lacks flexibility for unknown geometries and obstacles. This paper explores deep visual stereo odometry (DVSO) with 3D-geometric constraints as a focused alternative. DVSO is purely vision-based, leveraging stereo disparity, optical flow, and self-supervised learning to jointly estimate depth and ego-motion without labeled data. For global consistency, DVSO can subsequently be fused with absolute references (e.g., landmarks) or other sensors. We provide a conceptual evaluation for accelerator tunnel environments, using the European XFEL as a case study.

Physics-based vehicle models are often simplified for tractability and therefore exhibit inherent model-form uncertainty, motivating the need for data-driven correction. Moreover, non-autonomous dynamics are governed by time-dependent control inputs, which pose challenges in learning predictive models directly from temporal snapshot data. To address these, we reformulate the vehicle dynamics via a local parameterization of the time-dependent inputs, yielding a modified system composed of a sequence of local parametric dynamical systems. We approximate these parametric systems using two complementary approaches. First, we employ the DRIPS (dimension reduction and interpolation in parameter space) methodology to construct efficient linear surrogate models, equipped with lifted observable spaces and manifold-based operator interpolation. This enables data-efficient learning of vehicle models whose dynamics admit accurate linear representations in the lifted spaces. Second, for more strongly nonlinear systems, we employ FML (Flow Map Learning), a deep neural network approach that approximates the parametric evolution map without requiring special treatment of nonlinearities. We further extend FML with a transfer-learning-based model correction procedure, enabling the correction of misspecified prior models using only a sparse set of high-fidelity or experimental measurements, without assuming a prescribed form for the correction term. Through a suite of numerical experiments on unicycle, simplified bicycle, and slip-based bicycle models, we demonstrate that DRIPS offers robust and highly data-efficient learning of non-autonomous vehicle dynamics, while FML provides expressive nonlinear modeling and effective correction of model-form errors under severe data scarcity."}

To address these challenges, we propose Describe Anything, Anywhere, at Any Moment (DAAAM), a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding. DAAAM introduces a novel optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models, such as the Describe Anything Model (DAM), leveraging batch processing to speed up inference by an order of magnitude for online processing.

We show that DAAAM's 4D SG interfaces well with a tool-calling agent for inference and reasoning.\n  We thoroughly evaluate DAAAM in the complex task of spatio-temporal question answering on the NaVQA benchmark and show its generalization capabilities for sequential task grounding on the SG3D benchmark.

Fractional-order models provide an effective means of describing intrinsically time-dependent viscoelastic dynamics with few parameters, as these models can naturally capture memory effects. However, due to the unintuitive frequency-dependent coupling between the order of the fractional element and the other parameters, determining appropriate parameters for fractional-order models that yield high perceived realism remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a systematic means of determining the parameters of fractional-order viscoelastic models that optimizes the perceived realism of haptic rendering across general populations. First, we demonstrate that the parameters of fractional-order models can be effectively optimized through active learning, via qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop~(HiL) optimizations, to ensure consistently high realism ratings for each individual. Second, we propose a rigorous method to combine HiL optimization results to form an aggregate perceptual map trained on the entire dataset and demonstrate the selection of population-level optimal parameters from this representation that are broadly perceived as realistic across general populations. Finally, we provide evidence of the effectiveness of the generalized fractional-order viscoelastic model parameters by characterizing their perceived realism through human-subject experiments. Overall, generalized fractional-order viscoelastic models established through the proposed HiL optimization and aggregation approach possess the potential to significantly improve the sim-to-real transition performance of medical training simulators."}

Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss.

Under group-invariant Bellman backups for such cases, local symmetry-breaking introduces errors that propagate across the entire state-action space, resulting in global value estimation errors. To address this, we introduce Partially group-Invariant MDP (PI-MDP), which selectively applies group-invariant or standard Bellman backups depending on where symmetry holds. This framework mitigates error propagation from locally broken symmetries while maintaining the benefits of equivariance, thereby enhancing sample efficiency and generalizability. Building on this framework, we present practical RL algorithms -- Partially Equivariant (PE)-DQN for discrete control and PE-SAC for continuous control -- that combine the benefits of equivariance with robustness to symmetry-breaking.

Using deep reinforcement learning, the trout's neural system achieved hierarchical spatiotemporal control of muscle activation. We systematically examined how activation strategies affect speed and energy use. Results show that axial myomere coupling-with activation spanning over 0.5 body lengths-is crucial for stable body wave propagation.

WCDFP quantifies the likelihood of deadline misses under the most pessimistic operating conditions, and safe estimation is essential for dependable real-time applications. However, achieving high accuracy in WCDFP estimation often incurs significant computational cost. Recent studies have revealed that the classical assumption of the critical instant, the activation pattern traditionally considered to trigger the worst-case behavior, can lead to underestimation of WCDFP in probabilistic settings. This observation motivates the use of a revised critical instant formulation that more faithfully captures the true worst-case scenario. This paper investigates convolution-based methods for WCDFP estimation under this revised setting and proposes an optimization technique that accelerates convolution by improving the merge order. Extensive experiments with diverse execution-time distributions demonstrate that the proposed optimized Aggregate Convolution reduces computation time by up to an order of magnitude compared to Sequential Convolution, while retaining accurate and safe-sided WCDFP estimates.

Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments."}

However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments."}

Project page: https://stevenlsw.github.io/visualsync/", "summary": "Today, people can easily record memorable moments, ranging from concerts, sports events, lectures, family gatherings, and birthday parties with multiple consumer cameras. However, synchronizing these cross-camera streams remains challenging. Existing methods assume controlled settings, specific targets, manual correction, or costly hardware. We present VisualSync, an optimization framework based on multi-view dynamics that aligns unposed, unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy. Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms."}

Yet their stringent precision requirements demand highly robust models whose training relies on large amounts of annotated data. However, this kind of data is difficult to obtain in routine practice, especially negative samples. In this work, we focus on pipetting, the most critical and precision sensitive action in SDLs. To overcome the scarcity of training data, we build a hybrid pipeline that fuses real and virtual data generation. The real track adopts a human-in-the-loop scheme that couples automated acquisition with selective human verification to maximize accuracy with minimal effort. The virtual track augments the real data using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation, which is further screened and validated for reliability. Together, these two tracks yield a class-balanced dataset that enables robust bubble detection training. On a held-out real test set, a model trained entirely on automatically acquired real images reaches 99.6% accuracy, and mixing real and generated data during training sustains 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection and review load. Our approach offers a scalable and cost-effective strategy for supplying visual feedback data to SDL workflows and provides a practical solution to data scarcity in rare event detection and broader vision tasks."}
