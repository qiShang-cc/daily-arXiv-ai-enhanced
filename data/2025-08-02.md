Motivation: 解决异构混合模拟-数字H2AD MIMO架构在多发射源数量和方向智能感知方面的难题。

Method: 提出两阶段感知框架，包括三种目标数量感知方法（改进的EDC、增强DNN和1D-CNN）以及OMC-DOA方法进行DOA估计。

Result: 三种方法在中高信噪比下实现100%目标数量感知，1D-CNN在极低信噪比下表现优异；OMC-DOA在多源环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: H2AD MIMO架构在目标数量和方向感知方面表现出色，为未来无线网络提供了高效低复杂度的解决方案。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究通过fMRI分析脑瘤患者术前高阶神经动态能量特征，发现其与术后工作记忆下降相关，并利用机器学习预测准确性高达90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑瘤手术可能导致术后认知功能障碍，研究试图揭示术前神经动态变化与术后工作记忆下降的关系，以优化手术规划。

Method: 分析术前fMRI数据提取高阶脑交互能量特征，结合统计和随机森林模型，研究其与术后工作记忆表现的关系。

Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 设计了BSLE方法嵌入基站位置信息，并利用交叉-自注意力机制学习基站间关系，通过生成扩散模型实现跨基站CKM推理。

Conclusion: 该方法为优化基站部署提供了实用工具，并通过环境感知特性提升了通信效率。

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) inference across base stations (BSs) is the key
to achieving efficient environmentaware communications. This paper proposes an
environmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the
generative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location
embedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS
location information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the
cross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to
respectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as
that among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target
BSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM
inference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.
Specifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free
networks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM
construction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N
model is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any
potential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by
exploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same
wireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to
multi-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same
wireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit
correlation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the
proposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs. We
provide extensive comparisons of CKM inference between the proposed BS-1-to-N
generative model versus benchmarking schemes, and provide one use case study to
demonstrate its practical application for the optimization of BS deployment.

### [6] [A Secure Full-Duplex Wireless Circulator enabled by Non-Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal RIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23381)

Conclusion: NR-BD-RIS在全双工无线循环器中展现出卓越的性能和安全性，为未来通信系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a
promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling
flexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the
interconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave
reconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at
one port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local
control of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further
enhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,
channel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among
non-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of
NR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices
communicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure
transmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses
signal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a
physics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural
scattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,
the advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate
an all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization
algorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual
decomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS
consistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal
(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two
impinging and reflection directions need to be supported. By analyzing the
power of signals from all other users and the beampatterns, we show that secure
transmission can be achieved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的EVM性能受限于通用计算机的计算能力，制约了智能合约的执行效率。

Method: 提出了一种基于FPGA的硬件执行引擎EVMx，利用其并行处理和高速度特性优化智能合约执行。

Result: 实验显示，EVMx的执行时间比CPU环境减少了61%至99%，区块处理速度快6倍。

Conclusion: 硬件加速的EVMx能够显著提升智能合约执行效率，适用于EVM兼容的区块链。

Abstract: Ethereum blockchain uses smart contracts (SCs) to implement decentralized
applications (dApps). SCs are executed by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)
running within an Ethereum client. Moreover, the EVM has been widely adopted by
other blockchain platforms, including Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and
more. However, the EVM performance is limited by the constraints of the
general-purpose computer it operates on. This work proposes offloading SC
execution onto a dedicated hardware-based EVM. Specifically, EVMx is an
FPGA-based SC execution engine that benefits from the inherent parallelism and
high-speed processing capabilities of a hardware architecture. Synthesis
results demonstrate a reduction in execution time of 61% to 99% for commonly
used operation codes compared to CPU-based SC execution environments. Moreover,
the execution time of Ethereum blocks on EVMx is up to 6x faster compared to
analogous works in the literature. These results highlight the potential of the
proposed architecture to accelerate SC execution and enhance the performance of
EVM-compatible blockchains.

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are expected to adopt extremely
large aperture arrays (ELAAs), novel antenna architectures, and operate in
extremely high-frequency bands to meet growing data demands. ELAAs
significantly increase the number of antennas, enabling finer spatial
resolution and improved beamforming. At high frequencies, ELAAs shift
communication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where
spherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle
and distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel
estimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field
scenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel
estimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an
electromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences,
alongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream
near-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major
estimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations
(single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and
RIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among
estimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide
insights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel
estimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research
directions.

Result: 验证了MPGFRFT在图信号处理和图像加密解密中的优越性能。

Conclusion: MPGFRFT框架具有广泛适用性和高性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) applies a single global
fractional order to all graph frequencies, which restricts its adaptability to
diverse signal characteristics across the spectral domain. To address this
limitation, in this paper, we propose two types of multiple-parameter GFRFTs
(MPGFRFTs) and establish their corresponding theoretical frameworks. We design
a spectral compression strategy tailored for ultra-low compression ratios,
effectively preserving essential information even under extreme dimensionality
reduction. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a learnable order vector scheme
that enables adaptive compression and denoising, demonstrating strong
performance on both graph signals and images. We explore the application of
MPGFRFTs to image encryption and decryption. Experimental results validate the
versatility and superior performance of the proposed MPGFRFT framework across
various graph signal processing tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为无线网络优化提供了理论基础，同时启发了对大规模MIMO网络中传播特性的重新思考。

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless
networks, with a focus on the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) and
achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into
interference patterns of modern network architectures, such as cell-less and
extremely large MIMO networks, and it generalizes existing characterizations of
the weak Pareto boundary. A central contribution is the derivation of
sufficient conditions that guarantee convexity of the utility regions.
Convexity is an important property because it ensures that time sharing (or
user grouping) cannot simultaneously increase the utility of all users when the
network operates on the weak Pareto boundary. These sufficient conditions also
have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate
maximization problems that are inherently convex without any variable
transformations, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably
optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide a rigorous justification
for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable
rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an
alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO
literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the
beamforming strategy.

Abstract: Real-time transmission of high-resolution video signals in an uncompressed

communications (URLLC) medium with high bandwidth to maintain the quality of
experience (QoE) for users. We put forward the design and experimental
demonstration of a high-performance laser-based optical wireless communication
(OWC) system that enables high-definition (HD) video transmission with
submillisecond latencies. The serial digital interface (SDI) output of a camera
is used to transmit the live video stream over an optical wireless link by
directly modulating the SDI signal on the intensity of a 940 nm vertical cavity
surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The proposed SDI over light fidelity (LiFi)
system corroborates error-free transmission of full HD (FHD) and 4K
ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions at data rates of 2.97 Gb/s and 5.94
Gb/s, respectively, with a measured end-to-end latency of under 35 ns. Since
SDI standards support various video formats and VCSELs are high-bandwidth and
low-power devices, this presents a scalable and inexpensive solution for
wireless connectivity between professional broadcast equipment using
off-the-shelf SDI components.

Conclusion: 超图辅助的信任任务-资源匹配框架为复杂系统中的价值驱动任务完成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the diverse physical attributes of computing resources and tasks,
developing effective mechanisms to facilitate task and resource matching in
complex connected systems for value-oriented task completion has become
increasingly challenging. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a
networked physical computing system that integrates the physical attributes of
computing resources and tasks as well as task-specific trust relationships
among devices to enable value-driven task completion. Specifically, we propose
a state-of-the-art hypergraph-aided trusted task-resource matching
(TTR-matching) framework to achieve the envisioned physical computing. First, a
task-specific trusted physical resource hypergraph is defined, which integrates
task-specific trust, the physical attributes of resources, and task types. This
enables accurate modeling of device collaboration dependencies under specific
task types. Next, a task hypergraph is generated to associate the task
initiator with the physical attributes of the corresponding tasks. Based on
these two hypergraphs, a hypergraph matching algorithm is designed to
facilitate task-specific trusted collaborator selection and accurate
task-resource matching for value-maximizing task completion. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TTR-matching framework
outperforms comparison algorithms in identifying task-specific trustworthy
collaborators and maximizing the average value of task completion.

Abstract: Having established that Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences are inherently linear
micro-frequency hopping (lmFH) symbols, this paper first presents an intuitive

using the lmFH pattern. This yields interesting results. Subsequently, an
alternative form for computing the cumulative sum of ZC sequences using the
Generalized Quadratic Gauss Sum is introduced. Furthermore, building on the
micro-frequency hopping (mFH) concept, this paper shows that the DFT of ZC
sequences can be transformed into an lmFH symbol with frequency shift and phase
offset. Therefore, the DFT of ZC sequences can be computed via cumulative
frequency points, similar to the computation of normal mFH symbols.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the stochastic security performance of a multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a
downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to
simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target's angular location, and
counteract eavesdropping threats. The attack model considers a passive
single-antenna communication eavesdropper intercepting communication data, as
well as a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target's
location. We also consider a malicious target scenario where the target plays
the role of the communication eavesdropper. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers
channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target's azimuth angle is uniformly
distributed. To evaluate the performance in this random network, we derive the
ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), for
target localization, at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves
computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. We
characterize the boundary of the CRB-secrecy rate region, and interpret the
performance tradeoffs between communication and sensing while guaranteeing a
level of security and privacy in the random ISAC networks.

Abstract: As satellite communications play an increasingly important role in future
wireless networks, the issue of limited link budget in satellite systems has
attracted significant attention in current research. Although semantic
communications emerge as a promising solution to address these constraints, it
introduces the challenge of increased computational resource consumption in
wireless communications. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-layer
hybrid bit and generative semantic communication framework which can adapt to
the dynamic satellite communication networks. Furthermore, to balance the
semantic communication efficiency and performance in satellite-to-ground
transmissions, we introduce a novel semantic communication efficiency metric
(SEM) that evaluates the trade-offs among latency, computational consumption,
and semantic reconstruction quality in the proposed framework. Moreover, we
utilize a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to optimize the resource allocation in the proposed
network. Simulation results demonstrate the flexibility of our proposed
transmission framework and the effectiveness of the proposed metric SEM,
illustrate the relationships among various semantic communication metrics.

TL;DR: 论文研究了将超对角可重构智能表面（BDRIS）集成到无小区大规模多输入多输出（CFmMIMO）系统中，以增强同时无线信息和能量传输（SWIPT）性能。通过优化接入点选择、功率控制和BDRIS散射矩阵设计，显著提升了能量收集效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对角可重构智能表面（RIS）在能量收集方面效率有限，BDRIS通过更灵活的散射矩阵设计，有望显著提升无小区系统中的SWIPT性能。

Method: 研究提出了一种保护性部分零强迫预编码技术，以减少非相干干扰，并通过高效的优化算法（如启发式搜索、凸近似和深度强化学习）解决联合优化问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，BDRIS（尤其是群组或全连接架构）在能量收集方面优于传统对角RIS，平均总能量收集量最高可提升7倍。

Conclusion: BDRIS在CFmMIMO系统中的集成能显著改进SWIPT性能，尤其是在能量收集方面，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (BDRISs) into cell free massive multiple input multiple output
(CFmMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users energy
receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time
frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving
ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A
protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs
to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently,
closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average
sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive
optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power
control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term
statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then
effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems,
efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the
scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep
reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power
control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully
connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the
conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in
the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix
design is employed.

*James Rhodes,Lawrence Ong,Duy T. Ngo*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 论文提出WiRM，一种两阶段无接触呼吸监测方法，通过改进呼吸率估计和波形提取，显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有呼吸监测方法主要关注呼吸率或胸部运动，缺乏既能准确估计呼吸率又能提取呼吸波形的高效方法，WiRM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: WiRM采用两阶段方法：首先通过共轭乘法和自适应多迹追踪改进呼吸率估计，随后利用改进的呼吸率从CSI数据中分解和选择呼吸波形。

Result: WiRM在呼吸率估计上平均减少38%的RMSE，呼吸波形提取的绝对相关性提升178.3%，并在噪声环境中表现稳健。

Conclusion: WiRM是一种高效且稳健的无接触呼吸监测方法，在呼吸率和波形提取方面均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Monitoring respiratory health with the use of channel state information (CSI)
has shown promising results. Many existing methods focus on monitoring only the
respiratory rate, while others focus on monitoring the motion of the chest as a
patient breathes, which is referred to as the respiratory waveform. This paper
presents WiRM, a two-staged approach to contactless respiration monitoring. In
the first stage, WiRM improves upon existing respiratory rate estimation
techniques by using conjugate multiplication for phase sanitisation and
adaptive multi-trace carving (AMTC) for tracing how the respiratory rate
changes over time. When compared against three state-of-the-art methods, WiRM
has achieved an average reduction of $38\%$ in respiratory rate root mean
squared error (RMSE). In the second stage, WiRM uses this improved respiratory
rate estimate to inform the decomposition and selection of the respiratory
waveform from the CSI data. Remarkably, WiRM delivers a $178.3\%$ improvement
in average absolute correlation with the ground truth respiratory waveform.
Within the literature, it is difficult to compare the robustness of existing
algorithms in noisy environments. In this paper, we develop a purpose-built
simulation toolkit to evaluate the robustness of respiration monitoring
solutions under various noise conditions, including thermal, multiplicative,
and phase noise. Our results show that WiRM demonstrates improved or comparable
resilience to these common noise sources.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EMORe是一种自适应重建方法，通过整合自适应分箱校正和显式异常值拒绝，显著提高了5D心脏MRI的运动鲁棒性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统5D MRI的运动分箱方法由于心脏和呼吸信号提取不准确以及散在的体运动，导致残余运动伪影，影响了临床实用性。

Method: EMORe在期望最大化（EM）框架内整合自适应分箱校正和显式异常值拒绝，通过E步和M步交替执行直到收敛。

Result: 在模拟和实际验证中，EMORe在信噪比、结构相似性指数、边缘清晰度和分箱准确性方面均优于标准压缩感知重建。

Conclusion: 尽管计算复杂度略有增加，EMORe的适应性和对体运动伪影的鲁棒处理显著提升了5D心脏MRI的临床适用性和诊断信心。

Abstract: We propose EMORe, an adaptive reconstruction method designed to enhance
motion robustness in free-running, free-breathing self-gated 5D cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Traditional self-gating-based motion binning
for 5D MRI often results in residual motion artifacts due to inaccuracies in
cardiac and respiratory signal extraction and sporadic bulk motion,
compromising clinical utility. EMORe addresses these issues by integrating
adaptive inter-bin correction and explicit outlier rejection within an
expectation-maximization (EM) framework, whereby the E-step and M-step are
executed alternately until convergence. In the E-step, probabilistic (soft) bin
assignments are refined by correcting misassignment of valid data and rejecting
motion-corrupted data to a dedicated outlier bin. In the M-step, the image
estimate is improved using the refined soft bin assignments. Validation in a
simulated 5D MRXCAT phantom demonstrated EMORe's superior performance compared
to standard compressed sensing reconstruction, showing significant improvements
in peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, edge sharpness, and
bin assignment accuracy across varying levels of simulated bulk motion. In vivo
validation in 13 volunteers further confirmed EMORe's robustness, significantly
enhancing blood-myocardium edge sharpness and reducing motion artifacts
compared to compressed sensing, particularly in scenarios with controlled
coughing-induced motion. Although EMORe incurs a modest increase in
computational complexity, its adaptability and robust handling of bulk motion
artifacts significantly enhance the clinical applicability and diagnostic
confidence of 5D cardiac MRI.

TL;DR: 通过分析语音信号的动态特性，结合SSCFs和MFCCs，提出了一种用于越南语ASR的新方法，显著降低了词错率并提高了性别独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音信号的动态特性在增强自动语音识别（ASR）中起重要作用，因此需要一种能够捕捉动态特性并减少频谱变化的方法。

Method: 在SSCFs的比率平面中使用极坐标参数描述声学过渡，结合MFCCs捕捉更多频谱细节，并使用SSCF0作为基频的伪特征。

Result: 提出的参数显著降低了词错率，并且比基线MFCCs表现出更强的性别独立性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了越南语ASR的性能，尤其在动态特性捕捉和性别独立性方面表现突出。

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed
parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender
independence than the baseline MFCCs.

TL;DR: 研究分析了外骨骼设计中锚点位置对步态、肌肉激活和能量消耗的影响，发现后膝与前髋锚点组合能显著降低肌肉活动和代谢消耗，但最佳配置因人而异，需个性化设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锚点位置是外骨骼设计中的关键因素，但常被忽视。研究旨在明确其对步态、肌肉活动和能量消耗的具体影响。

Method: 使用XoSoft外骨骼辅助髋关节屈曲，设置了五种锚点配置，通过IMU、EMG传感器和代谢测量设备对11名受试者进行测试。

Result: 后膝与前髋锚点组合显著减少髋屈肌激活（10.21%）和代谢消耗（18.45%），但最佳配置因人而异，且髋关节辅助会影响膝踝运动学。

Conclusion: 锚点位置对外骨骼效果至关重要，但需个性化设计，未来需开发针对个体的肌肉骨骼模型并验证临床效果。

Abstract: Anchor point placement is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of exosuit
design since it determines how forces interact with the human body. This work
analyzes the impact of different anchor point positions on gait kinematics,
muscular activation and energetic consumption. A total of six experiments were
conducted with 11 subjects wearing the XoSoft exosuit, which assists hip
flexion in five configurations. Subjects were instrumented with an IMU-based
motion tracking system, EMG sensors, and a mask to measure metabolic
consumption. The results show that positioning the knee anchor point on the
posterior side while keeping the hip anchor on the anterior part can reduce
muscle activation in the hip flexors by up to 10.21\% and metabolic expenditure
by up to 18.45\%. Even if the only assisted joint was the hip, all the
configurations introduced changes also in the knee and ankle kinematics.
Overall, no single configuration was optimal across all subjects, suggesting
that a personalized approach is necessary to transmit the assistance forces
optimally. These findings emphasize that anchor point position does indeed have
a significant impact on exoskeleton effectiveness and efficiency. However,
these optimal positions are subject-specific to the exosuit design, and there
is a strong need for future work to tailor musculoskeletal models to individual
characteristics and validate these results in clinical populations.
