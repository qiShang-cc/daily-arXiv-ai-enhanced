<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG情感识别方法在时空动态建模和计算效率上存在不足，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: MSGM结合多窗口时间分割、双模态空间图建模和Mamba架构的高效融合，捕捉细粒度情感波动和脑连接层次结构。

Result: MSGM在多个数据集上超越现有方法，实现高精度和毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: MSGM通过创新的时空建模方法，显著提升了EEG情感识别的性能，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition struggles with capturing multi-scale
spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring computational efficiency for real-time
applications. Existing methods often oversimplify temporal granularity and
spatial hierarchies, limiting accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we
propose the Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Mamba (MSGM), a novel framework
integrating multi-window temporal segmentation, bimodal spatial graph modeling,
and efficient fusion via the Mamba architecture. By segmenting EEG signals
across diverse temporal scales and constructing global-local graphs with
neuroanatomical priors, MSGM effectively captures fine-grained emotional
fluctuations and hierarchical brain connectivity. A multi-depth Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) and token embedding fusion module, paired with
Mamba's state-space modeling, enable dynamic spatiotemporal interaction at
linear complexity. Notably, with just one MSST-Mamba layer, MSGM surpasses
leading methods in the field on the SEED, THU-EP, and FACED datasets,
outperforming baselines in subject-independent emotion classification while
achieving robust accuracy and millisecond-level inference on the NVIDIA Jetson
Xavier NX.

Abstract: Maritime channel modeling is crucial for designing robust communication
systems in marine environments, where factors like waves and wind impact signal
propagation. This article investigates land-to-ship maritime wireless channel
characteristics at 5.8 GHz based upon an extensive measurement campaign, with
concurrent hydrological and meteorological information collection. First, a
novel large-scale path loss model with physical foundation and high accuracy is
proposed for dynamic marine environments. Then, we introduce the concept of
sea-wave-induced fixed-point (SWIFT) fading, a peculiar phenomenon in maritime
scenarios that captures the impact of sea surface fluctuations on received
power. An enhanced two-ray model incorporating vessel rotational motion is
propounded to simulate the SWIFT fading, showing good alignment with measured
data, particularly for modest antenna movements. Next, the small-scale fading
is studied by leveraging a variety of models including the two-wave with
diffuse power (TWDP) and asymmetric Laplace distributions, with the latter
performing well in most cases, while TWDP better captures bimodal fading in
rough seas. Furthermore, maritime channel sparsity is examined via the Gini
index and Rician $K$ factor, and temporal dispersion is characterized. The
resulting channel models and parameter characteristics offer valuable insights
for maritime wireless system design and deployment.

*Yue Xiu,Wanting Lyu,You Li,Ran Yang,Phee Lep Yeoh,Wei Zhang,Guangyi Liu,Ning Wei*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于移动天线（MAs）的CF-DFRC系统，通过联合优化天线位置、波束成形和载频偏移（CFO）参数，显著提升了6G无线网络的频谱效率和感知精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决宽带场景中CFO导致的同步错误对通信和感知性能的严重影响。

Method: 采用鲁棒元强化学习（MRL）两阶段交替优化策略，结合流形优化和惩罚对偶分解（PDD）解决CFO鲁棒性问题。

Result: 提出的MRL方法在CFO环境下显著优于传统深度强化学习方案，并优于固定位置天线（FPAs）系统。

Conclusion: MA辅助的CF-DFRC系统在动态无线环境中表现出优异的通信和感知性能。

Abstract: By enabling spectrum sharing between radar and communication operations, the
cell-free dual-functional radar-communication (CF-DFRC) system is a promising
candidate to significantly improve spectrum efficiency in future
sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. However, in wideband scenarios,
synchronization errors caused by carrier frequency offset (CFO) can severely
reduce both communication capacity and sensing accuracy. To address this
challenge, this paper integrates movable antennas (MAs) into the CF-DFRC
framework, leveraging their spatial flexibility and adaptive beamforming to
dynamically mitigate CFO-induced impairments. To fully exploit the advantages
of MAs in wideband scenarios with CFO, we aim to maximize the worst-case
sum-rate of communication and sensing by jointly optimizing MA positions,
{beamforming}, and CFO parameters, subject to transmit power and MA positioning
constraints. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem, we propose a robust
meta reinforcement learning (MRL)-based two-stage alternating optimization
strategy. In the first stage, we employ manifold optimization (MO) with penalty
dual decomposition (PDD) to solve the CFO-robust worst-case subproblem. In the
second stage, we adopt to jointly optimize {the MA positions and beamforming
vectors} in a data-driven manner {for dynamic wireless environments}.
Simulation results show that the proposed MRL approach significantly
outperforms conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) schemes in both
communication and sensing performance under CFO impairments. Furthermore,
compared to fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the MA-aided CF-DFRC system

Method: 提出AQUES方案，结合拉格朗日对偶、SCA、PDD框架和启发式搜索等方法，优化BS波束成形和STARS配置。

Result: 仿真显示，AQUES显著提升能效，耦合STARS在硬件复杂度降低的同时表现最佳。

Conclusion: AQUES在多种网络参数和部署场景中优于现有方法，验证了其高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper investigates a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting
reconfigurable intelligent surface (STARS)-aided integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) systems in support of full-space energy-efficient data
transmissions and target sensing. We formulate an energy efficiency (EE)
maximization problem jointly optimizing dual-functional radar-communication
(DFRC)-empowered base station (BS) ISAC beamforming and STARS configurations of
amplitudes, phase-shifts, quantization levels as well as element selection.
Furthermore, relaxed/independent/coupled STARS are considered to examine
architectural flexibility. To tackle the non-convex and mixed-integer problem,
we propose a joint active-passive beamforming, quantization and element
selection (AQUES) scheme based on alternating optimization: Lagrangian dual and
Dinkelbach's transformation deals with fractions, whereas successive convex
approximation (SCA) convexifies the problem; Penalty dual decomposition (PDD)
framework and penalty-based convex-concave programming (PCCP) procedure solves
amplitude and phase-shifts; Heuristic search decides the quantization level;
Integer relaxation deals with the element selection. Simulation results
demonstrate that STARS-ISAC with the proposed AQUES scheme significantly
enhances EE while meeting communication rates and sensing quality requirements.
The coupled STARS further highlights its superior EE performance over
independent and relaxed STARS thanks to its reduced hardware complexity.
Moreover, AQUES outperforms existing configurations and benchmark methods in
the open literature across various network parameters and deployment scenarios.

### [5] [Liquid Intelligent Metasurface for Fluid Antennas-Assisted Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16211)
*Li-Hsiang Shen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于液体智能超表面（LIM）的下行多用户MISO系统，结合流体天线（FA）和液体元素实现电磁和空间可重构性，通过优化波束成形和相位移控制，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel liquid intelligent metasurface (LIM)-assisted
downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, wherein both
the base station (BS) and the metasurface are respectively equipped with fluid
antennas (FA) and liquid elements. Unlike conventional reconfigurable
metasurface-assisted systems with static geometries, the proposed architecture
enables joint electromagnetic and spatial reconfigurability by allowing both
the FA-empowered BS (FAS) and LIM to dynamically adjust their small-scale
positions in addition to beamforming and phase-shift controls. We formulate a
sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS beamforming, LIM
phase-shifts, and the positions of fluid antennas and liquid elements. The
problem is highly non-convex due to coupling between variables, fractional
expressions, unit-modulus constraints as well as spatial correlation functions.
To address these challenges, we adopt alternating optimization and introduce
auxiliary variables and employ successive convex approximation (SCA) as well as
the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) to solve the respective
subproblems. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed FAS-LIM
architecture significantly outperforms benchmark methods employing conventional
fixed metasurface and fixed antenna arrays in terms of various parameter
settings.

Conclusion: 该研究为ISCC-V2X系统提供了有效的资源分配方案，验证了性能提升的可行性。

Abstract: Incorporating mobile edge computing (MEC) and integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) has emerged as a promising technology to enable integrated
sensing, communication, and computing (ISCC) in the sixth generation (6G)
networks. ISCC is particularly attractive for vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
applications, where vehicles perform ISAC to sense the environment and
simultaneously offload the sensing data to roadside base stations (BSs) for
remote processing. In this paper, we investigate a particular ISCC-enabled V2X
system consisting of multiple multi-antenna BSs serving a set of single-antenna
vehicles, in which the vehicles perform their respective ISAC operations (for
simultaneous sensing and offloading to the associated BS) over orthogonal
sub-bands. With the focus on fairly minimizing the sensing completion latency
for vehicles while ensuring the detection probability constraints, we jointly
optimize the allocations of radio resources (i.e., the sub-band allocation,
transmit power control at vehicles, and receive beamforming at BSs) as well as
computation resources at BS MEC servers. To solve the formulated complex
mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose an alternating
optimization algorithm. In this algorithm, we determine the sub-band allocation
via the branch-and-bound method, optimize the transmit power control via
successive convex approximation (SCA), and derive the receive beamforming and
computation resource allocation at BSs in closed form based on generalized
Rayleigh entropy and fairness criteria, respectively. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed joint resource allocation design significantly
reduces the maximum task completion latency among all vehicles. Furthermore, we
also demonstrate several interesting trade-offs between the system performance
and resource utilizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 性能评估表明HRISs在传感及通信一体化方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: HRISs为智能无线环境提供了一种更具自主性和高效性的解决方案。

Abstract: The concept of smart wireless environments envisions dynamic programmable
propagation of information-bearing signals through the deployment of
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). Typical RIS implementations include
metasurfaces with passive unit elements capable to reflect their incident waves
in controllable ways. However, this solely reflective operation induces
significant challenges in the RIS orchestration from the wireless network. For
example, channel estimation, which is essential for coherent RIS-empowered
wireless communications, is quite challenging with the available solely
reflecting RIS designs. This chapter reviews the emerging concept of Hybrid
Reflecting and Sensing RISs (HRISs), which enables metasurfaces to reflect the
impinging signal in a controllable manner, while simultaneously sensing a
portion of it. The sensing capability of HRISs facilitates various network
management functionalities, including channel parameter estimation and
localization, while, most importantly, giving rise to computationally
autonomous and self-configuring RISs. The implementation details of HRISs are
first presented, which are then followed by a convenient mathematical model for
characterizing their dual functionality. Then, two indicative applications of
HRISs are discussed, one for simultaneous communications and sensing and
another that showcases their usefulness for estimating the individual channels
in the uplink of a multi-user HRIS-empowered communication system. For both of
these applications, performance evaluation results are included validating the
role of HRISs for sensing as well as integrated sensing and communications.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)
technology, Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) have shown significant
empowerment potential in the field of wireless networks due to advantages, such
as noise resistance, training stability, controllability, and multimodal
generation. Although there have been multiple studies focusing on GDMs for

application of GDMs in wireless networks. Firstly, starting from mathematical
principles, we analyze technical advantages of GDMs and present six
representative models. Furthermore, we propose the multi-layer wireless network
architecture including sensing layer, transmission layer, application layer,
and security plane. We also introduce the core mechanisms of GDM at each of the
layers. Subsequently, we conduct a rigorous review on existing GDM-based
schemes, with a focus on analyzing their innovative points, the role of GDMs,
strengths, and weaknesses. Ultimately, we extract key challenges and provide
potential solutions, with the aim of providing directional guidance for future
research in this field.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种由多功能可重构智能表面（MF-RIS）赋能的空间-空中-地面一体化网络（SAGIN）架构，旨在解决低地球轨道卫星在阴影区域的能量短缺问题，并通过优化多种参数最大化长期能效（EE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决低地球轨道（LEO）卫星在阴影区域的能量短缺问题，并综合考虑SAGIN节点中的通信和计算能耗，作者提出了一个基于MF-RIS的SAGIN架构。

Method: 论文提出了一种压缩混合智能的双模型增强多智能体深度强化学习（CHIMERA）框架，通过语义状态-动作压缩和参数化共享，优化MF-RIS和SAGIN的参数。

Result: 仿真结果表明，CHIMERA方案在能效方面显著优于传统基准方案，包括固定配置或无能量收集的MF-RIS、传统RIS及无RIS情况，以及集中式和多智能体深度强化学习基线。

Conclusion: SAGIN-MF-RIS架构通过互补覆盖实现了更高的能效性能，优于单独的卫星、空中或地面部署方案。

Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture is proposed,
empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS)
capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless
energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of
low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions, while
explicitly accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption
across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE), we
formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including
signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element
selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude
platform station (HAPS) deployment, user association, and computing capability.
The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed
discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid
intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and
parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore
suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the
proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks,
including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and
no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed
SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior EE performance due to its
complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone
satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

Abstract: Quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to enable
precision measurements of physical quantities such as time, magnetic and
electric fields, acceleration, and gravitational gradients well beyond the
limits of classical sensors. However, identifying suitable sensing probes and
measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires
optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum
sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum
circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum
channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are
typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning
criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian
inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active
information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for
non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step,
and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum
sensing agents.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)-empowered communication has emerged
as a transformative technology for next generation wireless networks, enabling
the programmable shaping of the propagation environment. However, conventional
RISs are fundamentally limited by the double path loss effect, which severely
attenuates the reflected signals. To overcome this, active RIS architectures,
capable of amplifying impinging signals, have been proposed. This chapter
investigates the modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of active
RISs, focusing on two hardware designs: a dual-RIS structure with a single
Power Amplifier (PA), and a reflection amplification structure at the unit cell
level using tunnel diodes. For the PA-based design, a comprehensive
mathematical model is developed, and closed-form expressions for the received
signal-to-noise ratio, bit error probability, and Energy Efficiency (EE) are
derived. An optimization framework for configuring the phase shifts and
amplifier gain is proposed to maximize system capacity under power constraints.
Regarding the second design, the integration of a tunnel diode into the unit
cell is carefully studied by analyzing its I-V characteristic, enabling the
derivation of the negative resistance range and the power consumption model.
Furthermore, the intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling of the reflection
coefficient is characterized through compact linear algebra formulations,
enabling practical optimization of active RISs. Extensive numerical simulations
validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that active RISs can
effectively overcome the double path loss limitation and achieve favorable EE
trade-offs compared to passive RISs. Finally, the trade-off between the
available power budget and the number of active elements is examined, revealing
that a higher number of active elements does not always lead to optimal
performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates a multi-user uplink mobile edge computing (MEC)
network, where the users offload partial tasks securely to an access point
under the non-orthogonal multiple access policy with the aid of a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) against a multi-antenna eavesdropper.
We formulate a non-convex optimization problem of minimizing the total energy
consumption subject to secure offloading requirement, and we build an efficient
block coordinate descent framework to iteratively optimize the number of local
computation bits and transmit power at the users, the RIS phase shifts, and the
multi-user detection matrix at the access point. Specifically, we successively
adopt successive convex approximation, semi-definite programming, and
semidefinite relaxation to solve the problem with perfect eavesdropper's
channel state information (CSI), and we then employ S-procedure and penalty
convex-concave to achieve robust design for the imperfect CSI case. We provide
extensive numerical results to validate the convergence and effectiveness of
the proposed algorithms. We demonstrate that RIS plays a significant role in
realizing a secure and energy-efficient MEC network, and deploying a
well-designed RIS can save energy consumption by up to 60\% compared to that
without RIS. We further reveal impacts of various key factors on the secrecy
energy efficiency, including RIS element number and deployment position, user
number, task scale and duration, and CSI imperfection.

Abstract: In this chapter, using statistical physics methods, asymptotic closed-form
expressions for the mean and variance of the mutual information for a
multi-antenna transmitter-receiver pair in the presence of multiple
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are presented. While nominally valid
in the large-system limit, it is shown that the derived Gaussian approximation
for the mutual information can be quite accurate, even for modest-sized antenna
arrays and metasurfaces. The above results are particularly useful when
fast-fading conditions are present, which renders channel estimation
challenging. The derived analysis indicates that, when the channel close to an
RIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle spread which is reasonable
for wireless systems with increasing carrier frequencies, the communication
link benefits significantly from statistical RIS optimization, resulting in
gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. More
importantly, the presented novel asymptotic properties of the correlation
matrices of the impinging and outgoing signals at the RISs can be deployed to
optimize the metasurfaces without brute-force numerical optimization. The
numerical investigation demonstrates that, when the desired reflection from any
of the RISs departs significantly from geometrical optics, the metasurfaces can
be optimized to provide robust communication links, without significant need
for their optimal placement.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: DASPack 是一种针对分布式声学传感（DAS）数据设计的高性能开源压缩工具，支持无损和有损压缩，显著减少文件大小，适用于大规模监测网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着 DAS 技术在实时高密度长距离监测中的广泛应用，数据量急剧增加，长期存储成为重大挑战。现有压缩方法在实用性和可扩展性上表现不足。

Method: DASPack 结合了小波变换、线性预测编码和熵编码，支持用户选择原始数据与压缩数据之间的最大绝对差异，实现高效压缩。

Result: 在无损模式下，文件大小最多减少 3 倍；在有损模式下，压缩比可达 6 倍（信号保真度高）或 10 倍（信号可接受性良好）。支持高速处理（单线程 100-200 MB/s，8 线程 750 MB/s）。

Conclusion: DASPack 在大规模监测网络中为 DAS 数据的长期可持续管理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present DASPack, a high-performance, open-source compression tool
specifically designed for distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data. As DAS
becomes a key technology for real-time, high-density, and long-range monitoring
in fields such as geophysics, infrastructure surveillance, and environmental
sensing, the volume of collected data is rapidly increasing. Large-scale DAS
deployments already generate hundreds of terabytes and are expected to increase
in the coming years, making long-term storage a major challenge. Despite this
urgent need, few compression methods have proven to be both practical and
scalable in real-world scenarios. DASPack is a fully operational solution that
consistently outperforms existing techniques for DAS data. It enables both
controlled lossy and lossless compression by allowing users to choose the
maximum absolute difference per datum between the original and compressed data.
The compression pipeline combines wavelet transforms, linear predictive coding,
and entropy coding to optimise efficiency. Our method achieves up to 3x file
size reductions for strain and strain rate data in lossless mode across diverse
datasets. In lossy mode, compression improves to 6x with near-perfect signal
fidelity, and up to 10x is reached with acceptable signal degradation. It
delivers fast throughput (100-200 MB/s using a single-thread and up to 750 MB/s
using 8-threads), enabling real-time deployment even under high data rates. We
validated its performance on 15 datasets from a variety of acquisition
environments, demonstrating its speed, robustness, and broad applicability.
DASPack provides a practical foundation for long-term, sustainable DAS data
management in large-scale monitoring networks.

Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless
communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than
ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more
efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting
agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint
optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead
to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of
traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical
and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is
implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at
the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a
post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a
constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two
solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear
DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under
semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power
constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint
equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint
approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range
of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

To overcome the limitations of conventional max-pooling, we integrate three
