The imaging system employs four transmitters, three of which emit\nspatially and temporally incoherent noise signals, while the fourth transmits a\nknown linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulsed signal. The spatial incoherence\nof the noise signals enables sampling of the 2D spatial Fourier spectrum of the\nscene from which two-dimensional cross-range (azimuth and elevation) images can\nbe formed via interferometric processing. Simultaneously, the LFM signal\nenables high-resolution downrange imaging through matched filtering. The\nreceived signals consist of a superposition of the noise sources and the known\npulse allowing for joint recovery of all three dimensions. We describe the\nsystem architecture and waveform design, and demonstrate the imaging technique\nusing both simulations with a linear array and experimental data from a 38 GHz\nactive incoherent millimeter-wave imaging system with 23-element randomized\narray.

The\ninterference of these beams forms spatially diverse speckle patterns that carry\ninformation about the entire ROI. As a result, this method can take advantage\nof the benefits of both random patterns and spotlight imaging. Since the\nspeckle pattern is formed by directive beams (instead of random patterns\ntypically used in computational imaging), this approach results in a higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced clutter. In contrast to raster\nscanning, which requires the number of measurements to be at least equal to the\nnumber of unknowns, our proposed approach follows a computational imaging\nframework and can obtain high-quality images even when only a few measurements\nare taken. Using numerical simulation, we demonstrate this method's\ncapabilities and contrast it against other conventional techniques.
