### [1] [Derivative-Free Optimization-Empowered Wireless Channel Reconfiguration for 6G](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02243)
*Peilan Wang,Jun Fang,Xianlong Zeng,Bin Wang,Zhi Chen,Yonina C. Eldar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无导数优化方法，用于直接优化可重构天线的系数以改善无线信道，无需信道建模或环境参数估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究可重构天线在6G及未来无线通信中优化无线信道的问题，传统方法需要复杂建模和参数估计，存在显著挑战。

Method: 采用无导数优化（零阶优化）技术，直接优化可重构系数，不依赖信道建模和隐式参数估计。

Conclusion: 无导数优化为可重构天线技术提供了新的研究方向，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Reconfigurable antennas, including reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS),
movable antenna (MA), fluid antenna (FA), and other advanced antenna
techniques, have been studied extensively in the context of reshaping wireless
propagation environments for 6G and beyond wireless communications.
Nevertheless, how to reconfigure/optimize the real-time controllable
coefficients to achieve a favorable end-to-end wireless channel remains a
substantial challenge, as it usually requires accurate modeling of the complex
interaction between the reconfigurable devices and the electromagnetic waves,
as well as knowledge of implicit channel propagation parameters. In this paper,
we introduce a derivative-free optimization (a.k.a., zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization) technique to directly optimize reconfigurable coefficients to
shape the wireless end-to-end channel, without the need of channel modeling and
estimation of the implicit environmental propagation parameters. We present the
fundamental principles of ZO optimization and discuss its potential advantages
in wireless channel reconfiguration. Two case studies for RIS and movable
antenna-enabled single-input single-output (SISO) systems are provided to show
the superiority of ZO-based methods as compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
Finally, we outline promising future research directions and offer concluding
insights on derivative-free optimization for reconfigurable antenna
technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信号处理中低信噪比、交叉和不连续情况下的啁啾信号分离问题。

Result: 在模拟数据集上进行了数值实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 改进的SSO方法在低信噪比和复杂场景下表现良好，为信号分离提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual
components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing
applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous
paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator
(SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such
superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In
this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp
signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We
give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to
examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude,
SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and
numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated
signals.

Abstract: This study examines an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
transceiver featuring a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable
intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and a receiver equipped with a passive
electronically scanned array (PESA) and a single digital channel. By utilizing
a periodic pulsed signal emitted by a feeder, we introduce at the STAR-RIS a
space modulation to illuminate two angular directions observed by the radar
receiver, one in each half-space, and a time modulation to distinguish the
corresponding echoes from prospective moving targets and embed communication
messages. The proposed time modulation employs orthogonal binary codebooks with
different trade-offs in transmission and error rates, while having minimal
impact on the radar performance, evaluated by probability of detection and root
mean square error in the radial velocity estimation.

### [4] [Joint Radiation Power, Antenna Position, and Beamforming Optimization for Pinching-Antenna Systems with Motion Power Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02348)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了考虑天线运动能耗和可调辐射功率的捏合天线系统（PASS）设计，通过联合优化天线位置、辐射功率比和传输波束成形，最小化了满足服务质量要求的平均功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽略了天线放置的物理约束和固定辐射功率的假设，本文填补了这一空白。

Method: 采用ADMM框架解决连续天线移动问题，用BCD方法处理离散天线移动的非线性整数规划问题。

Result: 仿真验证了纳入PA运动能耗和可调辐射功率的性能提升，揭示了PASS在减少大尺度路径损耗和用户间干扰上的优势。

Conclusion: PASS设计通过优化天线位置和辐射功率，显著提升了无线网络性能，优于传统MIMO系统。

Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have been recently proposed to improve the
performance of wireless networks by reconfiguring both the large-scale and
small-scale channel conditions. However, existing studies ignore the physical
constraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To
fill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into
account the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact
of adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average
power consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly
optimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit
beamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to
consider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional
degree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and
discrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the
fact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the
channel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To
tackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for
continuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a
mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block
coordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance
enhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and
adjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the
efficiency of the proposed optimization framework. The benefits of PASS over
conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in mitigating the
large-scale path loss and inter-user interference is also revealed.

Abstract: This study considers a base station equipped with sensing and communication
capabilities, which serves a ground user and scans a portion of the sky via a
passive reconfigurable intelligent surface. To achieve more favorable system
tradeoffs, we utilize a multi-frame radar detector, comprising a detector, a
plot-extractor, and a track-before-detect processor. The main idea proposed
here is that user spectral efficiency can be enhanced by increasing the number
of scans jointly processed by the multi-frame radar detector while maintaining
the same sensing performance. A numerical analysis is conducted to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed solution and to evaluate the achievable system
tradeoffs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空无线网络（LAWN）有望支持物联网（IoT）中的时敏控制应用，但需优化通信可靠性与控制性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效优化了LAWN系统中的实时控制问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have been envisioned as flexible and
transformative platforms for enabling delay-sensitive control applications in
Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In this work, we investigate the real-time
wireless control over a LAWN system, where an aerial drone is employed to serve
multiple mobile automated guided vehicles (AGVs) via finite blocklength (FBL)
transmission. Toward this end, we adopt the model predictive control (MPC) to
ensure accurate trajectory tracking, while we analyze the communication
reliability using the outage probability. Subsequently, we formulate an
optimization problem to jointly determine control policy, transmit power
allocation, and drone trajectory by accounting for the maximum travel distance
and control input constraints. To address the resultant non-convex optimization
problem, we first derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability
under FBL transmission. Based on this, we reformulate the original problem as a
quadratic programming (QP) problem, followed by developing an alternating
optimization (AO) framework. Specifically, we employ the projected gradient
descent (PGD) method and the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to
achieve computationally efficient sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, we
thoroughly analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed
algorithm. Extensive simulations and AirSim-based experiments are conducted to
validate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to the baseline
schemes in terms of control performance.

Conclusion: 研究为LEO卫星在高速目标参数估计中的应用提供了新方法，验证了OTFS调制在通信感知一体化系统中的潜力。

Abstract: This study investigates a communication-centric integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system that utilizes orthogonal time frequency space
(OTFS) modulated signals emitted by low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to
estimate the parameters of space targets experiencing range migration,
henceforth referred to as high-speed targets. Leveraging the specific signal
processing performed by OTFS transceivers, we derive a novel input-output model
for the echo generated by a high-speed target in scenarios where ideal and
rectangular shaping filters are employed. Our findings reveal that the target
response exhibits a sparse structure in the delay-Doppler domain, dependent
solely upon the initial range and range-rate; notably, range migration causes a
spread in the target response, marking a significant departure from previous
studies. Utilizing this signal structure, we propose an approximate
implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the target's initial
range, range-rate, and amplitude. The estimation process involves obtaining
coarse information on the target response using a block orthogonal matching
pursuit algorithm, followed by a refinement step using a bank of matched
filters focused on a smaller range and range-rate region. Finally, numerical
examples are provided to evaluate the estimation performance.

### [8] [When Attention is Beneficial for Learning Wireless Resource Allocation Efficiently?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02427)
*Jia Guo,Chenyang Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文探讨了注意力机制在资源分配中的必要性，分析了集合上的置换等变函数结构，提出了一种结合注意力机制和GNN的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力机制在无线资源分配中的作用，以提升GNN的效率和泛化能力。

Method: 通过分析集合上的置换等变函数和数值算法，设计了一种结合注意力机制的GNN框架。

Result: 模拟实验验证了所提GNN在学习效率上的优势。

Conclusion: 当干扰未反映在可测参数中时，注意力机制必不可少，否则可以省略。

Abstract: Owing to the use of attention mechanism to leverage the dependency across
tokens, Transformers are efficient for natural language processing. By
harnessing permutation properties broadly exist in resource allocation
policies, each mapping measurable environmental parameters (e.g., channel
matrix) to optimized variables (e.g., precoding matrix), graph neural networks
(GNNs) are promising for learning these policies efficiently in terms of
scalability and generalizability. To reap the benefits of both architectures,
there is a recent trend of incorporating attention mechanism with GNNs for
learning wireless policies. Nevertheless, is the attention mechanism really
needed for resource allocation? In this paper, we strive to answer this
question by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical
algorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are
induced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the
permutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed
by two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not. We
proceed to re-express the numerical algorithms for optimizing several
representative resource allocation problems in recursive forms. We find that
when interference (say multi-user or inter-data stream interference) is not
reflected in the measurable parameters of a policy, attention needs to be used
to model the interference. With the insight, we establish a framework of
designing GNNs by aligning with the structures. By taking reconfigurable
intelligent surface-aided hybrid precoding as an example, the learning
efficiency of the proposed GNN is validated via simulations.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文指出之前发表的过渡系数和PSL值存在错误，并通过程序计算给出了更优的数值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纠正Rabiner等人和Lyons书中关于FSF设计中的过渡系数和PSL值的错误。

Method: 通过程序计算并验证低通和带通滤波器的过渡系数及PSL值。

Result: 获得了更优的过渡系数和PSL值，例如$N=16$和BW$=4$时，最优值为$0.40474097$。

Conclusion: 论文提供了更准确的FSF设计参数，修正了已有文献中的错误。

Abstract: Tables of optimal transition coefficients and peak sidelobe level (PSL, in
dB) associated with frequency sampling filter (FSF) design were published by
Rabiner et al. (Jun 1970), and reproduced, for example, in the book Digital
Signal Processing by Proakis and Manolakis (4/e, 2007). A set of values are
also given in Appendix H of Understanding Digital Signal Processing} by Lyons
(3/e, 2011), but there are significant differences between these two sets. For
example, for $N=16$ and BW$=4$, two different transition coefficient values
have been reported, viz., $0.38916626$ (Rabiner, et al.) and $0.34918551$
(Lyons). Neither is optimal, for we find the optimum value to be $0.40474097$.
The published values of the corresponding PSLs were also found to be incorrect.
In this paper we give the optimal values of the transition coefficients and PSL
values as estimated by our program for the lowpass and bandpass filters listed
in Rabiner et al. and Lyons.

Main category: eess.SP

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高频谱效率而不增加硬件复杂度，利用pinching-antenna位置模式索引传递信息，同时通过优化收发器设计解决性能问题。

Method: 设计了综合信道模型，结合确定性波导传播效应和无线信道的随机性；提出低复杂度的BOSD算法替代ML检测；使用流形优化设计新的发射预编码方法，最小化误码率。

Result: 仿真结果表明，PA-IM方案性能显著优于传统方法，且所提出的预编码设计大幅降低了系统的误码率。

Conclusion: PA-IM方案在频谱效率和性能上均表现出色，为无线通信系统提供了一种高效的新方法。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel pinching-antenna assisted index modulation (PA-IM)
scheme is proposed for improving the spectral efficiency without increasing the
hardware complexity, where the information bits are conveyed not only by the
conventional M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols but also by
the indices of pinching antenna (PA) position patterns. To realize the full
potential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver
design, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and
performance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel
model is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the
deterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of
wireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading.
Next, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML)
detection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is
designed, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML
performance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER)
is derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding
method is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by
jointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the
waveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all
received signal points. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed PA-IM scheme attains a significant performance gain over its
conventional counterparts and that the overall BER of the pinching-antenna
system is substantially improved by the proposed precoding design.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种交替残差消除算法（AREE），通过将混合波束成形问题分解为两个低维子问题，有效解耦模拟和数字预编码器，在毫米波通信中实现高效能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合波束成形在毫米波通信（如V2X场景）中被广泛使用，但其模拟和数字预编码器的耦合限制了算法的计算效率和频谱效率。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了AREE算法。

Method: AREE算法将问题分解为两个低维子问题，通过迭代消除残差误差解耦预编码器。初始化和低复杂度几何信道SVD算法简化了子问题的推导。

Result: 仿真结果表明，AREE算法能以低复杂度快速收敛，解耦预编码器，并比其他波束成形方法提供更高的频谱效率。

Conclusion: AREE算法在毫米波通信中表现出色，是解决混合波束成形问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Hybrid beamforming has been widely employed in mmWave communications such as
vehicular-to-everything (V2X) scenarios, as a compromise between hardware
complexity and spectral efficiency. However, the inherent coupling between
analog and digital precoders in hybrid array architecture significantly limits
the computational and spectral efficiency of existing algorithms. To address
this issue, we propose an alternating residual error elimination (AREE)
algorithm, which decomposes the hybrid beamforming problem into two
low-dimensional subproblems, each exhibiting a favorable matrix structure that
enables effective decoupling of analog and digital precoders from the matrix
product formulation. These subproblems iteratively eliminate each other's
residual errors, driving the original problem toward the optimal hybrid
beamforming performance. The proposed initialization ensures rapid convergence,
while a low-complexity geometric channel SVD algorithm is developed by
transforming the high-dimensional sparse channel into a low-dimensional
equivalent, thereby simplifying the derivation of subproblems. Simulation
results demonstrate that the AREE algorithm effectively decouples analog and
digital precoders with low complexity, achieves fast convergence, and offers
higher spectral efficiency than existing beamforming methods.

Method: 提出使用DNN辅助快速选择码字，替代传统的穷举搜索方法，并结合离散傅里叶变换向量设计码本。

Result: 仿真表明，DNN在测试阶段能保持接近最优的频谱效率，且对距离变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DNN在RIS辅助系统中展现出降低计算复杂度并保持性能的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为空间受限的高速互联提供了可行方案，适用于WiNoC和小芯片应用。

Abstract: Efficient chip-scale interconnects are essential for modern
microelectronic-photonic systems, supporting high bandwidth and low-latency
processing. Traditional wired links face high resistivity and latency, while
millimeter-wave wireless solutions suffer from bandwidth congestion and
interference. Terahertz (THz) plasmonic communication, based on surface plasmon
polaritons (SPPs), offers high data rates and broad bandwidth, and is
compatible with nanophotonic platforms. This work introduces a Binary
Field-Driven Meta-Routing Method supported by a semi-analytical framework that
models the tunable interaction between THz plasmonic phenomena and graphene's
electromagnetic properties. By modulating graphene's impedance, the method
enables dynamic coupling and routing of localized surface plasmon resonances
(LSPRs) across a meta-network, facilitating real-time beam steering in
chip-scale systems. Combining analytical conductivity models, coupled-mode
theory, and algorithmic control, the approach enables predictive configuration
of LSPR-based steering in reconfigurable graphene metasurfaces. Four meta-pixel
antenna configurations Y-MetaRouter, MetaSwitcher, Penta-MetaEmitter, and
CP-MetaCore are designed to support unidirectional radiation, bi-directional
steering, frequency-driven transitions, and circular polarization,
respectively. Chemical potential modulation creates reconfigurable LSPR
pathways and virtual SPP channels. A Coupled-Mode Theory for Field-Driven LSPR
Meta-Networks is proposed to model current distributions and predict far-field
characteristics. Results show strong agreement between theory and full-wave
simulations. A point-to-point meta-wireless link is analyzed, demonstrating
scalability for low-latency, high-performance THz communication in WiNoC and
chiplet applications. System-level metrics confirm feasibility for
space-constrained, high-speed interconnects.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了实际协作感知中的挑战，为多智能体融合设定了新标杆。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular
algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without
explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the
adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results
exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA
with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute
deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including
scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear
convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.

*Philipp del Hougne*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在RIS设计及无线环境部分或完全未知的情况下，估计多端口网络理论（MNT）模型参数的实用技术，通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究基于多端口网络理论（MNT）建模RIS无线信道时，通常忽略实际中RIS设计和无线电环境可能未知的问题，这促使研究者探索如何在实验中估计MNT参数。

Method: 结合解析方法和梯度下降优化步骤的技术，适用于多比特可编程RIS元素，并讨论了参数模糊性问题。

Result: 在未知的富散射环境中通过实验验证了技术有效性，发现MNT模型与忽略互耦效应的级联模型在精度上存在17 dB差异，但端到端性能差异较小。

Conclusion: 尽管MNT模型在精度上更优，但在实际应用中，忽略互耦效应的简化模型可能足够，为RIS设计和优化提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Physics-consistent theoretical studies on RIS-parametrized wireless channels
use models from multiport-network theory (MNT) to capture mutual-coupling (MC)
effects. However, in practice, RIS design and radio environment are partially
or completely unknown. We fill a research gap on how to estimate the MNT model
parameters in such experimentally relevant scenarios. Our technique efficiently
combines closed-form and gradient-descent steps, and it can be applied to
multi-bit-programmable RIS elements. We discuss inevitable (but operationally
irrelevant) parameter ambiguities. We experimentally validate our technique in
an unknown rich-scattering environment parametrized by eight 8-bit-programmable
RIS elements of unknown design. We experimentally evaluate the performance of
RIS configurations optimized with the estimated MNT model and an MC-unaware
cascaded model. While the models differ in accuracy by up to 17 dB, the
end-to-end performance differences are small.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上验证了框架的性能和可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效提升车联网服务的质量和适应性。

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) transforms the transportation ecosystem
promising pervasive connectivity and data-driven approaches. Deep learning and
generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly
enhance the operation of applications within IoV by facilitating efficient
decision-making and predictive capabilities, including intelligent navigation,
vehicle safety monitoring, accident prevention, and intelligent traffic
management. Nevertheless, efficiently transmitting and processing the massive
volumes of data generated by the IoV in real-time remains a significant
challenge, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable wireless channel
conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a semantic
communication framework based on channel perception to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of data transmission. The semantic communication model extracts and
compresses the information to be transmitted. In addition, the wireless channel
is estimated by using a generative diffusion model, which is employed to
predict the dynamic channel states, thereby improving the quality of IoV
service. In dynamic scenarios, however, the channel estimation performance may
be degraded when substantially new scenarios take place, which will adversely
affect user experience. To mitigate this limitation, we employ a large model to
fine-tune the channel generation model to enhance its adaptability for varying
scenarios. The performance and reliability of the proposed framework are
evaluated on the two public datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference
Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits
a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers
exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and
tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a
range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are
extracted for every target. For a single target, the resulting bistatic delays
are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric
position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed
equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are
obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account
for time synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving
target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to
standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results
show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G
PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.

*Mona Mostafa,Ramy H. Gohary,Amr El-Keyi,Yahia A. Eldemerdash Ahmed*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种方法，用于在混合模拟/数字接收器中解决小样本数下的到达方向估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在小样本数情况下，传统方法无法可靠估计到达方向，尤其是在混合模拟/数字接收器中存在信号纠缠和低维投影问题。

Method: 两种方法：一种适用于全连接和部分连接接收器，利用周期性信号解纠缠；另一种仅适用于部分连接接收器，利用块对角结构。

Result: 数值模拟表明，所提方法优于Cramér-Rao下界。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了混合接收器中的到达方向估计问题，适用于小样本数场景。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to estimate the directions of arrival (DoAs) for
hybrid analog/digital (HAD) receivers when the number of snapshots is too small
for statistical averaging to be reliable. This goal is achieved in
fully-digital receivers by employing the matrix pencil method (MPM).
Unfortunately, the MPM cannot be directly applied in HAD receivers because of
the entanglement induced by the underlying analog combiners on the output
signals. Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a
low-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from
particular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two
approaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two
approaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by
cycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the
entire space. The first approach can be applied to both fully-connected (FC)
and partially-connected (PC) HADs and relies on the availability of periodic,
potentially unknown, signals to disentangle the output of the HAD receiver. The
second approach applies to PC-HADs only, and eliminates contingency on periodic
signals by exploiting the underlying block diagonal structure. The superiority
of the proposed approaches is demonstrated via numerical simulations and
comparisons with the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound.

Motivation: 未来无线网络需要处理缺乏数学模型的多样服务，LLMO框架被提出作为黑盒优化的解决方案。

Result: 理论证明LLMO框架的收敛性，多LLM架构能提升收敛速度，数值模拟验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: LLMO框架在理论和实验上均表现出可行性，为黑盒优化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Future wireless networks are expected to incorporate diverse services that
often lack general mathematical models. To address such black-box network
management tasks, the large language model (LLM) optimizer framework, which
leverages pretrained LLMs as optimization agents, has recently been promoted as
a promising solution. This framework utilizes natural language prompts
describing the given optimization problems along with past solutions generated
by LLMs themselves. As a result, LLMs can obtain efficient solutions
autonomously without knowing the mathematical models of the objective
functions. Although the viability of the LLM optimizer (LLMO) framework has
been studied in various black-box scenarios, it has so far been limited to
numerical simulations. For the first time, this paper establishes a theoretical
foundation for the LLMO framework. With careful investigations of LLM inference
steps, we can interpret the LLMO procedure as a finite-state Markov chain, and
prove the convergence of the framework. Our results are extended to a more
advanced multiple LLM architecture, where the impact of multiple LLMs is
rigorously verified in terms of the convergence rate. Comprehensive numerical
simulations validate our theoretical results and provide a deeper understanding
of the underlying mechanisms of the LLMO framework.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用RIS增强通信感知集成（ISAC）的框架，用于结构健康监测（SHM），通过动态调整RIS相位以提高测量精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ISAC在SHM中的应用潜力，解决多径干扰和高精度需求等挑战。

Method: 利用RIS作为参考点，动态调整相位抑制多径干扰，基于费雪信息理论分析三维网络中的协同感知，并通过贝叶斯推理模型识别结构状态。

Result: 理论和数值分析表明，ISAC可实现毫米级变形检测，满足SHM的高精度要求。

Conclusion: ISAC结合RIS技术在高精度SHM应用中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of future
cellular systems, enabling applications such as intruder detection, monitoring,
and tracking using the same infrastructure. However, its potential for
structural health monitoring (SHM), which requires the detection of slow and
subtle structural changes, remains largely unexplored due to challenges such as
multipath interference and the need for ultra-high sensing precision. This
study introduces a novel theoretical framework for SHM via ISAC by leveraging
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as reference points in collaboration
with base stations and users. By dynamically adjusting RIS phases to generate
distinct radio signals that suppress background multipath interference,
measurement accuracy at these reference points is enhanced. We theoretically
analyze RIS-aided collaborative sensing in three-dimensional cellular networks
using Fisher information theory, demonstrating how increasing observation time,
incorporating additional receivers (even with self-positioning errors),
optimizing RIS phases, and refining collaborative node selection can reduce the
position error bound to meet SHM's stringent accuracy requirements.
Furthermore, we develop a Bayesian inference model to identify structural
states and validate damage detection probabilities. Both theoretical and
numerical analyses confirm ISAC's capability for millimeter-level deformation
detection, highlighting its potential for high-precision SHM applications.

*Sunder Ram Krishnan*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个称为受限拟凸等距性质（RQIP）的广义RIP，针对0<α<1的α稳定随机投影，推导了RQIP成立的矩阵行数下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究α稳定随机矩阵在稀疏恢复中的应用，探讨传统RIP框架是否适用于这类矩阵。

Method: 利用对称α稳定（SαS）变量的经验分数矩浓度不等式和稀疏ℓα球的覆盖数界，推导RQIP所需的最小行数。

Result: 证明了RQIP成立的样本复杂度，反映了多项式尾行为，表明RIP框架可能需要其他稀疏恢复方法替代。

Conclusion: 研究支持了文献中的观察，即稀疏恢复实践中可能需要基于零空间性质的替代方案。

Abstract: We formulate a generalization of the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)
referred to as the Restricted Quasiconvexity Isometry Property (RQIP) for alpha
stable random projections with $0<\alpha<1$. A lower bound on the number of
rows for RQIP to hold for random matrices whose entries are drawn from a
symmetric $\alpha$-stable ($S\alpha S$) distribution is derived. The proof
leverages two key components: a concentration inequality for empirical
fractional moments of $S\alpha S$ variables and a covering number bound for
sparse $\ell_\alpha$ balls. The resulting sample complexity reflects the
polynomial tail behavior of the concentration and reinforces an observation
made in the literature that the RIP framework may have to be replaced with
other sparse recovery formulations in practice, such as those based on the null
space property.
