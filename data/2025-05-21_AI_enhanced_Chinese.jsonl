The choice\nbetween OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an\narchitectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and\nembracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known,\nequalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in\nthe presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is\nnon-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to\ninter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and\nits acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in\ndoubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high\nmobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the\ntypical use case, today and in the future.

Firstly, to reduce the\ncomplexity of near-field (NF) channel modeling and estimation between IoT\ndevices and active IRS, a sub-blocking strategy for active IRS is proposed.\nSpecifically, the entire active IRS is divided into multiple smaller\nsub-blocks, so that IoT devices are located in the far-field (FF) region of\neach sub block, while also being located in the NF region of the entire active\nIRS. This strategy significantly simplifies the channel model and reduces the\nparameter estimation dimension by decoupling the high-dimensional NF channel\nparameter space into low dimensional FF sub channels. Subsequently, the\nrelationship between channel approximation error and CE error with respect to\nthe number of sub blocks is derived, and the optimal number of sub blocks is\nsolved based on the criterion of minimizing the total error. In addition,\nconsidering that the amplification capability of active IRS requires power\nconsumption, a closed-form expression for the optimal power allocation factor\nis derived. To further reduce the pilot overhead, a lightweight CE algorithm\nbased on convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and multi-head attention mechanism,\ncalled CAEformer, is designed. The Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived to\nevaluate the proposed algorithm's performance.

While many auditory attention decoding (AAD)\nstudies have used high-density scalp EEG, such systems are impractical for\ndaily use as they are bulky and uncomfortable. Therefore, AAD with wearable and\nunobtrusive EEG systems that are comfortable to wear and can be used for\nlong-term recording are required. Around-ear EEG systems like cEEGrids have\nshown promise in AAD, but in-ear EEG, recorded via custom earpieces offering\nsuperior comfort, remains underexplored. We present a new AAD dataset with\nsimultaneously recorded scalp, around-ear, and in-ear EEG, enabling a direct\ncomparison. Using a classic linear stimulus reconstruction algorithm, a\nsignificant performance gap between all three systems exists, with AAD\naccuracies of 83.4% (scalp), 67.2% (around-ear), and 61.1% (in-ear) on 60s\ndecision windows.

However, existing models face significant\nchallenges in achieving a comprehensive understanding across diverse audio\ntypes, such as speech, general audio events, and music.

To deal with the above challenges,\nthis paper introduces U-SAM, an advanced audio language model that integrates\nspecialized encoders for speech, audio, and music with a pre-trained large\nlanguage model (LLM).

Additionally, U-SAM incorporates a\nSemantic-Aware Contrastive Loss Module, which explicitly identifies redundant\naudio features under language supervision and rectifies their semantic and\nspectral representations to enhance cross-modal alignment. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that U-SAM consistently outperforms both specialized\nmodels and existing audio language models across multiple benchmarks.

GMT uses the volume integral equation\n(VIE) in the forward problem and assumes that the sample has negligible effect\non the coil currents. Consequently, GMT calculates the coil's incident fields\nwith an initial EP distribution and keeps them constant for all optimization\niterations. This can lead to erroneous reconstructions. This work introduces a\nnovel version of GMT that replaces VIE with the volume-surface integral\nequation (VSIE), which recalculates the coil currents at every iteration based\non updated EP estimates before computing the associated fields. Methods: We\nsimulated an 8-channel transceiver coil array for 7 T brain imaging and\nreconstructed the EP of a realistic head model using VSIE-based GMT. We built\nthe coil, collected experimental MR measurements, and reconstructed EP of a\ntwo-compartment phantom.

In experiments, the relative\ndifference with respect to probe-measured EP values in the inner (outer)\ncompartment was 13% (26%) and 17% (33%) for the permittivity and conductivity,\nrespectively. Conclusion: The use of VSIE over VIE enhances GMT's performance\nby accounting for the effect of the EP on the coil currents.
