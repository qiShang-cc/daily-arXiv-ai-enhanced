This paper\ninvestigates the optimization of the sensing accuracy of a UAV swarm deployed\nto perform multi-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)\nsensing. In conventional single-baseline InSAR systems, only one synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) antenna pair acquires two SAR images from two distinct\nangles to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) of the target area. However,\nmulti-baseline InSAR extends this concept by aggregating multiple acquisitions\nfrom different angles, thus, significantly enhancing the vertical accuracy of\nthe DEM. The heavy computations required for this process are performed on the\nground and, therefore, the radar data is transmitted in real time to a ground\nstation (GS) via a frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) air-to-ground\nbackhaul link. This work focuses on improving the sensing precision by\nminimizing the height error of the averaged DEM while simultaneously ensuring\nsensing and communication quality-of-service (QoS). To this end, the UAV\nformation, velocity, and communication power allocation are jointly optimized\nusing evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Our approach is benchmarked against\nestablished optimization methods, including genetic algorithms (GAs), simulated\nannealing (SA), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques.

As such,\ndigital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of\nhardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding\nfor coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard\nnature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly\noutputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the\nintended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by\ndirectly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability\nof the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC\nfunctions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is\nproposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum\nrate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the\nproposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission\n(MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the\nDAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs\nrespectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal\nprocessing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in\noverall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for\nbaseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for\nhigher bandwidths.
