It is important for tasks such as\nspectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent\nyears, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC.

However, the\npowerful cross modal representation capability of vision-language model (VLM)\nprovides a promising approach.

In this paper, we present a VLM-driven\ncontrastive learning based multimodal beam prediction framework that integrates\nmultimodal data via modality-specific encoders.
