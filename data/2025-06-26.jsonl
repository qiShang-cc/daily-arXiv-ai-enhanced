An early approach by Chan and Gadbois in\n1985 introduced a theoretical method for modulation classification using a\nmathematically derived parameter called R. The authors proved that the R value\n- the ratio of the variance to the square of the mean of the signal envelope -\ncan be a distinguishing feature for classification. In this work, we revisit\nthe R value and show that classification accuracy can be improved further\nthrough statistical methods. We extend R-value analysis to demonstrate its\neffectiveness even after signals are transformed using the Hilbert transform\nfollowed by the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Our analysis includes\ntesting on 300000 signals across AM, DSB, and SSB classes, with each class\nhaving 100000 random variations.

To fully obtain the performance gain provided by RAs, accurate\nchannel state information (CSI) is essential for adjusting the\norientation/boresight of each antenna. In this letter, we propose an efficient\nchannel estimation scheme for RA communication systems, where the base station\n(BS) can sequentially and adaptively adjust the orientations of RAs to enrich\nthe environmental observations from diverse angular perspectives, thereby\nenhancing the channel estimation accuracy. The proposed scheme includes two\nmain procedures that are conducted alternately during each channel training\nperiod. Specifically, the first procedure is to estimate the CSI with given\nRAs' orientations, involving the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) information and path\ngains. Then, based on the estimated CSI, the second procedure adjusts the RAs'\norientations to maximize the effective channel gain. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed channel estimation method outperforms other\nbenchmark schemes."}

Tangirala"], "title": "Causal discovery in deterministic discrete LTI-DAE systems", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.SY", "eess.SP", "eess.SY", "stat.ME"], "comment": null, "summary": "Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is\nof vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A\nrecent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal\ndiscovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are\nidentified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical\nsystems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method\nworks efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations.\nHowever, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are\ncoupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or\nmixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables\n(PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is\nsuperior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as\nPoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic\nequations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal\nsubset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations\n($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix.\nSubsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of\nthe constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are\npresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB\ncameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major\nchallenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume\nof triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission\nscheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while\naccomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and\nevent cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often\nresulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address\nthis, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to\neliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our\napproach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to\ndisentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs.\nThis disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness\nand informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information.\nMoreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene\ndynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to\nimages for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nscheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to\nconventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance."}

To design this dual-purpose feedback, we introduce a modified\nprojected gradient descent algorithm that minimizes a weighted combination of\ncommunication and sensing errors. Simulation results show that the proposed\nfeedback design outperforms the state-of-the-art feedback design in the URA\nliterature. Furthermore, we illustrate the trade-off between communication and\nsensing capabilities, offering valuable insight into balancing these two tasks."}
