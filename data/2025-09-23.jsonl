Recently, two PSD estimators mitigated the loud transient impact\non PSD estimates by applying order statistics filtering (OSF). The first, the\nSchwock and Abadi Welch Percentile, scales a single rank order statistic (OS)\nof consecutive periodograms. The second, the truncated linear order statistics\nfilter, is a weighted sum of OS up to a chosen rank. In order to minimize\nvariance, both OSFs must carefully choose the highest rank that still\neliminates the loud transients. However, in real-time applications in dynamic\nenvironments, loud transients occur at unpredictable rates, requiring dynamic\nadjustment of the OSF ranks to keep low bias and variance. To circumvent the\nchallenges of real-time rank selection, this paper proposes a convex sum of\nOSFs across ranks with blending weights that are sequentially adjusted to favor\nthe lowest variance OSFs over a recent time window.

The sensor array is\noften towed behind the ship, using a long flexible cable to reduce interference\nfrom the own-ship's inherent noises. This forms a towed cable sensor-array\nsystem (TCSAS). During BOT, the tow-ship has to perform a manoeuvre to make the\ntracking system observable. Such a manoeuvre destabilises the TCSAS, thus\nmaking its exact location unknown \\emph{w.r.t.} tow-ship.

The GFRHT\nincorporates a dual-parameter framework: the fractional order $\\alpha$ enables\nanalysis across arbitrary fractional domains, interpolating between vertex and\nspectral spaces, while the angle parameter $\\beta$ provides adjustable phase\nshifts and a non-zero real-valued response ($\\cos\\beta$) for real eigenvalues,\nthereby eliminating information loss. We formally define the GFRHT, establish\nits core properties, and design a method for graph analytic signal\nconstruction, enabling precise envelope extraction and demodulation.\nExperiments on edge detection, anomaly identification, and speech\nclassification demonstrate that GFRHT outperforms GHT, offering greater\nflexibility and superior performance in graph signal processing."}

To address these challenges, this paper introduces\na novel self-supervised learning network (SSNet) designed for efficient and\nadaptive channel extrapolation in FAS. We formulate the problem of channel\nextrapolation in FAS as an image reconstruction task. Here, a limited number of\nunmasked pixels (representing the known CSI of the selected ports) are used to\nextrapolate the masked pixels (the CSI of unselected ports). SSNet capitalizes\non the intrinsic structure of FAS channels, learning generalized\nrepresentations from raw CSI data, thus reducing dependency on large labelled\ndatasets. For enhanced feature extraction and noise resilience, we propose a\nmix-of-expert (MoE) module. In this setup, multiple feedforward neural networks\n(FFNs) operate in parallel. The outputs of the MoE module are combined using a\nweighted sum, determined by a gating function that computes the weights of each\nFFN using a softmax function. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of\nthe proposed model. Results indicate that SSNet significantly outperforms\nbenchmark models, such as AGMAE and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks by\nusing a much smaller labelled dataset."}

Series elastic actuators (SEAs) fundamentally advance\nsafety by introducing compliant actuation. On the one hand, adding a spring\nmitigates the impact of accidental collisions between human and robot; but on\nthe other hand, this spring introduces oscillations and fundamentally decreases\nthe robot's ability to perform precise, accurate motions. So how should we\ntrade off between physical safety and performance? In this paper, we enumerate\nthe different linear control and mechanical configurations for series elastic\nactuators, and explore how each choice affects the rendered compliance,\npassivity, and tracking performance. While prior works focus on load side\ncontrol, we find that actuator side control has significant benefits. Indeed,\nsimple PD controllers on the actuator side allow for a much wider range of\ncontrol gains that maintain safety, and combining these with a damper in the\nelastic transmission yields high performance.

These include a variety of gaits, traversing\ncomplex terrains (eg. stairs and slopes) as well as previously unseen\nstepping-stones and narrow beams, and interacting with objects (eg. pushing\nbuttons, tracking trajectories).

Human operators typically extract these boulders using\nonly standard digging buckets, avoiding time-consuming tool changes to\nspecialized grippers. This task demands manipulating irregular objects with\nunknown geometries in harsh outdoor environments where dust, variable lighting,\nand occlusions hinder perception. The excavator must adapt to varying soil\nresistance--dragging along hard-packed surfaces or penetrating soft\nground--while coordinating multiple hydraulic joints to secure rocks using a\nshovel. Current autonomous excavation focuses on continuous media (soil,\ngravel) or uses specialized grippers with detailed geometric planning for\ndiscrete objects. These approaches either cannot handle large irregular rocks\nor require impractical tool changes that interrupt workflow. We train a\nreinforcement learning policy in simulation using rigid-body dynamics and\nanalytical soil models. The policy processes sparse LiDAR points (just 20 per\nrock) from vision-based segmentation and proprioceptive feedback to control\nstandard excavator buckets.

ByteWrist addresses the critical\nlimitations of existing serial and parallel wrists in narrow-space operations\nthrough a compact three-stage parallel drive mechanism integrated with\narc-shaped end linkages. The design achieves precise RPY (Roll-Pitch-Yaw)\nmotion while maintaining exceptional compactness, making it particularly\nsuitable for complex unstructured environments such as home services, medical\nassistance, and precision assembly.

Moreover,\nour approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87--0.97) for the\nreconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to\ndiverse environments with minimal effort.

Monocular video offers an attractive\ninput format due to its simplicity and scalability; however, it's challenging\nto disentangle the object geometry and part dynamics with visual supervision\nalone, as the joint movement of the camera and parts leads to ill-posed\nestimation. While motion priors from pre-trained tracking models can alleviate\nthe issue, how to effectively integrate them for articulation learning remains\nlargely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce VideoArtGS, a novel\napproach that reconstructs high-fidelity digital twins of articulated objects\nfrom monocular video. We propose a motion prior guidance pipeline that analyzes\n3D tracks, filters noise, and provides reliable initialization of articulation\nparameters. We also design a hybrid center-grid part assignment module for\narticulation-based deformation fields that captures accurate part motion.\nVideoArtGS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in articulation and mesh\nreconstruction, reducing the reconstruction error by about two orders of\nmagnitude compared to existing methods. VideoArtGS enables practical digital\ntwin creation from monocular video, establishing a new benchmark for\nvideo-based articulated object reconstruction.

We\ninvestigate whether a purely self-supervised encoder can match or surpass\nconventional supervised ImageNet-pretrained backbones (e.g., ResNet-18) under\nthree regimes: training from scratch, frozen, and finetuned. Across four\nbenchmark tasks (Push-T, Lift, Can, Square) using a unified FiLM-conditioned\ndiffusion policy, we find that (i) finetuned DINOv3 matches or exceeds\nResNet-18 on several tasks, (ii) frozen DINOv3 remains competitive, indicating\nstrong transferable priors, and (iii) self-supervised features improve sample\nefficiency and robustness. These results support self-supervised large visual\nmodels as effective, generalizable perceptual front-ends for action diffusion\npolicies, motivating further exploration of scalable label-free pretraining in\nrobotic manipulation. Compared to using ResNet18 as a backbone, our approach\nwith DINOv3 achieves up to a 10% absolute increase in test-time success rates\non challenging tasks such as Can, and on-the-par performance in tasks like\nLift, PushT, and Square."}
