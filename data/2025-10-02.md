<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号的复杂性导致认知过程和内在神经状态同时编码，造成跨模态表示学习的困难，论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出将EEG信号及其对应模态映射到统一的语义空间，并引入WaveMind-Instruct-338k数据集进行指令调优。

Result: 模型在四个下游任务中展示了强大的分类准确性和开放式对话能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经科学研究和通用EEG模型的发展提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation using multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach for analyzing brain signals. However,
the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG
signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural
states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective
cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover
complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight,
we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a
unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable
conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the
first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model
demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible,
open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering
valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of
general-purpose EEG models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种标准化的点数据格式，用于整合不同来源的无线电传播测量数据，并通过实际案例验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G对新型频谱的需求促使全球对新兴频段、用例和天线类型的无线电传播测量产生兴趣。然而，缺乏标准化的数据格式限制了测量数据的有效利用和全球标准化进程的推进。

Method: 引入了一种标准化的点数据格式，并结合环境地图和测量摘要元数据表，以结构化方式整合不同来源的测量数据。

Result: 通过纽约大学和南加州大学的两个独立亚THz城市微蜂窝测量案例，验证了该格式的有效性，并得出了路径损耗指数等关键参数的优化估计。

Conclusion: 采用这种简单统一的格式将加速信道模型的开发，支持多机构数据集的建设，并为AI/ML应用提供可靠的训练数据。

Abstract: The necessity of new spectrum for 6G has intensified global interest in radio
propagation measurements across emerging frequency bands, use cases, and
antenna types. These measurements are vital for understanding radio channel
properties in diverse environments, and involve time-consuming and expensive
campaigns. A major challenge for the effective utilization of propagation
measurement data has been the lack of a standardized format for reporting and
archiving results. Although organizations such as NIST, NGA, and 3GPP have made
commendable efforts for data pooling, a unified machine-readable data format
for consolidating measurements across different institutions and frequencies
remains a missing piece in advancing global standardization efforts. This paper
introduces a standardized point-data format for radio propagation measurements
and demonstrates how institutions may merge disparate campaigns into a common
format. This data format, alongside an environmental map and a measurement
summary metadata table, enables integration of data from disparate sources by
using a structured representation of key parameters. Here, we show the efficacy
of the point-data format standard using data gathered from two independent
sub-THz urban microcell (UMi) campaigns: 142 GHz measurements at New York
University (NYU) and 145 GHz measurements at the University of Southern
California (USC). A joint path loss analysis using the close-in path loss model
(1 m ref. distance) yields a refined estimate of the path loss exponent (PLE)
employing the proposed standard to pool measurements. Other statistics such as
RMS delay spread and angular spread are also determined using a joint
point-data table. Adopting this simple, unified format will accelerate channel
model development, build multi-institutional datasets, and feed AI/ML
applications with reliable training data in a common format from many sources.

### [3] [Site-Specific Beam Learning for Full-Duplex Massive MIMO Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00342)
*Samuel Li,Ian P. Roberts*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于波束学习的框架，绕过显式自干扰信道估计，通过设计波束码本和深度学习网络，实现高效全双工操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波和大规模MIMO系统中，显式自干扰信道估计的导频开销过高，限制了现有方法的实用性，尤其是在快衰落条件下。

Method: 设计波束码本以隐式获取信道信息，并通过深度学习网络合成发射和接收波束。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法能以75-97%更少的测量次数，实现低自干扰和高信噪比的全双工基站服务。

Conclusion: 提出的波束学习框架在减少测量开销的同时，显著提升了全双工系统的性能。

Abstract: Existing beamforming-based full-duplex solutions for multi-antenna wireless
systems often rely on explicit estimation of the self-interference channel. The
pilot overhead of such estimation, however, can be prohibitively high in
millimeter-wave and massive MIMO systems, thus limiting the practicality of
existing solutions, especially in fast-fading conditions. In this work, we
present a novel beam learning framework that bypasses explicit
self-interference channel estimation by designing beam codebooks to efficiently
obtain implicit channel knowledge that can then be processed by a deep learning
network to synthesize transmit and receive beams for full-duplex operation.
Simulation results using ray-tracing illustrate that our proposed technique can
allow a full-duplex base station to craft serving beams that couple low
self-interference while delivering high SNR, with 75-97% fewer measurements
than would be required for explicit estimation of the self-interference
channel.

Conclusion: 该方法为心理健康评估提供了有效的客观工具。

Abstract: Accurate identification of mental health biomarkers can enable earlier
detection and objective assessment of compromised mental well-being. In this
study, we analyze electrodermal activity recorded during an Emotional Stroop
task to capture sympathetic arousal dynamics associated with depression and
suicidal ideation. We model the timing of skin conductance responses as a point
process whose conditional intensity is modulated by task-based covariates,
including stimulus valence, reaction time, and response accuracy. The resulting
subject-specific parameter vector serves as input to a machine learning
classifier for distinguishing individuals with and without depression. Our
results show that the model parameters encode meaningful physiological
differences associated with depressive symptomatology and yield superior
classification performance compared to conventional feature extraction methods.

Abstract: Regular physiological monitoring of maternal and fetal parameters is
indispensable for ensuring safe outcomes during pregnancy and parturition.
Fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) assessment is crucial to detect fetal distress
and developmental anomalies. Given challenges of prenatal care due to the lack
of medical professionals and the limit of accessibility, especially in remote
and resource-poor areas, we develop a fECG monitoring system using novel
non-contact electrodes (NCE) to record the fetal/maternal ECG (f/mECG) signals
through clothes, thereby improving the comfort during measurement. The system
is designed to be incorporated inside a maternity belt with data acquisition,
data transmission module as well as novel NCEs. Thorough characterizations were
carried out to evaluate the novel NCE against traditional wet electrodes (i.e.,
Ag/AgCl electrodes), showing comparable performance. A successful {preliminary
pilot feasibility study} conducted with pregnant women (n = 10) between 25 and
32 weeks of gestation demonstrates the system's performance, usability and
safety.

*Shingo Takemoto,Shunsuke Ono*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出GeoSSTV方法，通过几何一致性的TV正则化解决HS图像去噪和去条纹任务，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HS图像因设备和环境噪声导致质量问题，现有TV方法在保留圆结构和斜边缘上不足。

Method: GeoSSTV引入几何一致性TV，通过欧几里得方式测量各方向变化，并开发了高效优化算法。

Result: 实验证明在混合噪声HS图像上，GeoSSTV性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoSSTV有效解决了现有TV方法的局限性，提升了HS图像恢复质量。

Abstract: This article proposes a novel regularization method, named Geometric
Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (GeoSSTV), for hyperspectral (HS) image
denoising and destriping. HS images are inevitably affected by various types of
noise due to the measurement equipment and environment. Total Variation
(TV)-based regularization methods that model the spatio-spectral piecewise
smoothness inherent in HS images are promising approaches for HS image
denoising and destriping. However, existing TV-based methods are based on
classical anisotropic and isotropic TVs, which cause staircase artifacts and
lack rotation invariance, respectively, making it difficult to accurately
recover round structures and oblique edges. To address this issue, GeoSSTV
introduces a geometrically consistent formulation of TV that measures
variations across all directions in a Euclidean manner. Through this
formulation, GeoSSTV removes noise while preserving round structures and
oblique edges. Furthermore, we formulate the HS image denoising problem as a
constrained convex optimization problem involving GeoSSTV and develop an
efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method.
Experimental results on HS images contaminated with mixed noise demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches.

### [7] [Radiation Pattern Reconfigurable FAS-Empowered Interference-Resilient UAV Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00581)

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在角度传感精度和频谱效率上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RPR-FAS方案有效提升了无人机通信的抗干扰能力和频谱效率，为未来无人机通信提供了新思路。

Abstract: The widespread use of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) has propelled the
development of advanced techniques on countering unauthorized UAV flights.
However, the resistance of legal UAVs to illegal interference remains
under-addressed. This paper proposes radiation pattern reconfigurable fluid
antenna systems (RPR-FAS)-empowered interference-resilient UAV communication
scheme. This scheme integrates the reconfigurable pixel antenna technology,
which provides each antenna with an adjustable radiation pattern. Therefore,
RPR-FAS can enhance the angular resolution of a UAV with a limited number of
antennas, thereby improving spectral efficiency (SE) and interference
resilience. Specifically, we first design dedicated radiation pattern adapted
from 3GPP-TR-38.901, where the beam direction and half power beamwidth are
tailored for UAV communications. Furthermore, we propose a low-storage-overhead
orthogonal matching pursuit multiple measurement vectors algorithm, which
accurately estimates the angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the communication link, even
in the single antenna case. Particularly, by utilizing the Fourier transform to
the radiation pattern gain matrix, we design a dimension-reduction technique to
achieve 1--2 order-of-magnitude reduction in storage requirements. Meanwhile,
we propose a maximum likelihood interference AoA estimation method based on the
law of large numbers, so that the SE can be further improved. Finally,
alternating optimization is employed to obtain the optimal uplink radiation
pattern and combiner, while an exhaustive search is applied to determine the
optimal downlink pattern, complemented by the water-filling algorithm for
beamforming. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes
outperform traditional methods in terms of angular sensing precision and
spectral efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准的路径损耗预测对无线通信系统的网络规划、天线设计和性能优化至关重要，现有传统方法缺乏灵活性和准确性。

Method: 使用射线追踪仿真技术生成合成数据集，训练随机森林回归（RFR）和K最近邻（KNN）等机器学习模型，并与传统模型（如COST-231 Hata、Longley-Rice和Close-in）进行比较。

Result: RFR和KNN算法在预测精度上表现最佳，显著优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 机器学习结合射线追踪技术是一种灵活且经济高效的无线电波传播预测方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Accurate path loss (PL) prediction is crucial for successful network
planning, antenna design, and performance optimization in wireless
communication systems. Several conventional approaches for PL prediction have
been adopted, but they have been demonstrated to lack flexibility and accuracy.
In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) models
in predicting PL, particularly for the sub-6 GHz band in a suburban campus of
King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). For training
purposes, we generate synthetic datasets using the ray-tracing simulation
technique. The feasibility and accuracy of the ML-based PL models are verified
and validated using both synthetic and measurement datasets. The random forest
regression (RFR) and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms provide the best
PL prediction accuracy compared to other ML models. In addition, we compare the
performance of the developed ML-based PL models with the traditional
propagation models, including COST-231 Hata, Longley-Rice, and Close-in models.
The results show the superiority of the ML-based PL models compared to
conventional models. Therefore, the ML approach using the ray-tracing technique
can provide a promising and cost-effective solution for predicting and modeling
radio wave propagation in various scenarios in a flexible manner.

Motivation: 由于频谱拥堵和地面干扰源位置的不确定性，射频干扰（RFI）对低地球轨道（LEO）卫星通信的上行链路构成了日益严峻的挑战。研究旨在解决RFI源位置不确定性对干扰抑制的影响。

Method: 论文首先分析RFI位置的地理不确定性如何转化为卫星观测的角度偏差，随后提出了一种鲁棒的零陷整形框架，通过随机优化将RFI位置不确定性的PDF融入波束形成设计，动态调整天线阵列的零陷模式以增强不确定性下的干扰抑制能力。

Conclusion: 通过融入RFI位置不确定性的概率信息，提出的鲁棒波束形成框架能有效提升卫星通信系统在不确定性环境中的干扰抑制能力。

Abstract: Radio frequency interference (RFI) poses a growing challenge to satellite
communications, particularly in uplink channels of Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
systems, due to increasing spectrum congestion and uncertainty in the location
of terrestrial interferers. This paper addresses the impact of RFI source
position uncertainty on beamforming-based interference mitigation. First, we
analytically characterize how geographic uncertainty in RFI location translates
into angular deviation as observed from the satellite. Building on this, we
propose a robust null-shaping framework to increase resilience in the
communication links by incorporating the probability density function (PDF) of
the RFI location uncertainty into the beamforming design via stochastic
optimization. This allows adaptive shaping of the antenna array's nulling
pattern to enhance interference suppression under uncertainty. Extensive Monte
Carlo simulations, incorporating realistic satellite orbital dynamics and
various RFI scenarios, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
significantly improved mitigation performance compared to conventional
deterministic designs.

Motivation: 为了在具有地理地形和建筑物形状的场景中，准确模拟RIS辅助信道的性能，并验证其在多径环境中的效果。

Method: 使用三个通道黑箱分别代表直接信号路径、RIS的发射路径和反射路径，通过射线追踪获取复杂系数，并考虑地面和建筑物墙壁的电气特性。

Result: 模拟结果显示接收功率符合多径衰落环境特征，RIS辅助信道的性能随RIS单元数量的平方提升，最佳部署位置靠近发射端或接收端。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效模拟RIS辅助信道，仿真结果与理论模型一致，验证了RIS在多径环境中的性能增益。

Abstract: A method of simulating a single-input single-output reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) assisted channel is presented using three channel
black boxes to represent the direct signal path, the transmit path to the RIS
and the reflected path from the RIS. The complex coefficients for each channel
box is obtained by ray tracing in a scenario with geographic terrain
information that also contains approximate building shapes. The electrical
characteristics of the ground and building walls were also accounted for in the
ray tracing function. Simulations were conducted with reflected rays only and
reflected rays together with diffracted rays. The received power exhibits
variations typical of multipath fading environments. In the best locations, the
RIS-assisted channel simulation result agrees well with theoretical models, the
performance increasing by the RIS size squared as the number of RIS elements is
increased. In the simplified theoretical model where the transmitter and
receiver are inline and the RIS orthogonal but much closer than the distance
between the former elements, the simulation results also corroborate best
deployment close the transmitter or the receiver with a U-shaped drop between
them.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks require intelligent traffic prediction to
enable autonomous resource management and handle diverse, dynamic service
demands. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) framework provides a promising
foundation for embedding machine learning intelligence through its
disaggregated architecture and programmable interfaces. This work applies a
Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-based framework that dynamically selects and
orchestrates efficient Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures for traffic
prediction in O-RAN environments. Our approach leverages the O-RAN paradigm by
separating architecture optimisation (via non-RT RIC rApps) from real-time
inference (via near-RT RIC xApps), enabling adaptive model deployment based on
traffic conditions and resource constraints. Experimental evaluation across six
LSTM architectures demonstrates that lightweight models achieve $R^2 \approx
0.91$--$0.93$ with high efficiency for regular traffic, while complex models
reach near-perfect accuracy ($R^2 = 0.989$--$0.996$) during critical scenarios.
Our NAS-based orchestration achieves a 70-75\% reduction in computational
complexity compared to static high-performance models, while maintaining high
prediction accuracy when required, thereby enabling scalable deployment in
real-world edge environments.

Result: 理论分析和实验结果均表明GNN在稀疏无线网络中的可迁移性有效。

Conclusion: 研究填补了GNN在无线网络中可迁移性理论空白，为实际应用提供了支持。

Abstract: The growing complexity of wireless systems has accelerated the move from
traditional methods to learning-based solutions. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
are especially well-suited here, since wireless networks can be naturally
represented as graphs. A key property of GNNs is transferability: models
trained on one graph often generalize to much larger graphs with little
performance loss. While empirical studies have shown that GNN-based wireless
policies transfer effectively, existing theoretical guarantees do not capture
this phenomenon. Most works focus on dense graphs where node degrees scale with
network size, an assumption that fails in wireless systems. In this work, we
provide a formal theoretical foundation for transferability on Random Geometric
Graphs (RGGs), a sparse and widely used model of wireless networks. We further
validate our results through numerical experiments on power allocation, a
fundamental resource management task.

*Junwei Ji,Dongyuan Shi,Zhengding Luo,Boxiang Wang,Ziyi Yang,Haowen Li,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种鲁棒的通信框架，结合自适应-固定滤波器切换和混合梯度组合策略，以解决分布式多通道主动噪声控制系统中通信开销导致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式多通道主动噪声控制（DMCANC）系统通过分散计算负载来协作抑制噪声，但通信开销可能影响系统稳定性和性能。

Method: 采用自适应-固定滤波器切换和混合梯度组合策略，节点实时监控噪声抑制水平，性能下降时切换至固定滤波器并启动通信，交换梯度信息后更新滤波器并恢复自适应模式。

Result: 仿真显示，该方法在通信受限下实现了与集中式算法相当的噪声抑制性能，同时保持了系统稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架在现实分布式ANC场景中具有实际应用价值，能够有效解决通信问题带来的不稳定风险。

Abstract: Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC) systems assign the
high computational load of conventional centralized algorithms across multiple
processing nodes, leveraging inter-node communication to collaboratively
suppress unwanted noise. However, communication overhead can undermine
algorithmic stability and degrade overall performance. To address this
challenge, we propose a robust communication framework that integrates
adaptive-fixed-filter switching and the mixed-gradient combination strategy. In
this approach, each node independently executes a single-channel filtered
reference least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm while monitoring real-time noise
reduction levels. When the current noise reduction performance degrades
compared to the previous state, the node halts its adaptive algorithm, switches
to a fixed filter, and simultaneously initiates a communication request. The
exchanged information comprises the difference between the current control
filter and the filter at the time of the last communication, equivalent to the
accumulated gradient sum during non-communication intervals. Upon receiving
neighboring cumulative gradients, the node employs a mixed-gradient combination
method to update its control filter, subsequently reverting to the adaptive
mode. This proactive communication strategy and adaptive-fixed switching
mechanism ensure system robustness by mitigating instability risks caused by
communication issues. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
noise reduction performance comparable to centralized algorithms while
maintaining stability under communication constraints, highlighting its
practical applicability in real-world distributed ANC scenarios.

TL;DR: RoboPilot是一个双思维闭环框架，用于解决机器人操作中的复杂任务执行问题，通过反馈和自适应推理提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主机器人在复杂或长时间任务中表现不佳，缺乏反馈和自适应能力。

Method: RoboPilot结合了原始动作的结构化任务规划和灵活动作生成，并引入反馈机制和Chain-of-Thought推理。

Result: 在实验中，RoboPilot的任务成功率比现有方法高25.9%，并在工业机器人上验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RoboPilot通过在动态环境中平衡效率和准确性，显著提升了机器人操作的表现。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autonomous robotics, executing complex or
long-horizon tasks remains a fundamental challenge. Most current approaches
follow an open-loop paradigm with limited reasoning and no feedback, resulting
in poor robustness to environmental changes and severe error accumulation. We
present RoboPilot, a dual-thinking closed-loop framework for robotic
manipulation that supports adaptive reasoning for complex tasks in real-world
dynamic environments. RoboPilot leverages primitive actions for structured task
planning and flexible action generation, while introducing feedback to enable
replanning from dynamic changes and execution errors. Chain-of-Thought
reasoning further enhances high-level task planning and guides low-level action
generation. The system dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to
balance efficiency and accuracy. To systematically evaluate the robustness of
RoboPilot in diverse robot manipulation scenarios, we introduce
RoboPilot-Bench, a benchmark spanning 21 tasks across 10 categories, including
infeasible-task recognition and failure recovery. Experiments show that
RoboPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25.9\% in task success
rate, and the real-world deployment on an industrial robot further demonstrates
its robustness in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器人任务中的规划能力有限，虽然Gemini 2.5 Flash可替代部分TAMP组件，但其成功率和规划时间表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在复杂机器人问题中的规划能力，尤其是如何将其语义知识与TAMP的形式推理结合。

Method: 开发16种算法，使用Gemini 2.5 Flash替代TAMP关键组件，通过零样本实验测试了4,950个问题和三个领域。

Result: Gemini-based planners的成功率较低，规划时间较长；几何细节会增加任务规划错误；非推理LLM变体在多数情况下表现优于推理变体。

Conclusion: LLMs在TAMP中的直接应用效果有限，需进一步优化结合方式。

Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex robotics problems
requires understanding their planning capabilities. Yet while we know that LLMs
can plan on some problems, the extent to which these planning capabilities
cover the space of robotics tasks is unclear. One promising direction is to
integrate the semantic knowledge of LLMs with the formal reasoning of task and
motion planning (TAMP). However, the myriad of choices for how to integrate
LLMs within TAMP complicates the design of such systems. We develop 16
algorithms that use Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components. Our
zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems and three domains reveal that the
Gemini-based planners exhibit lower success rates and higher planning times
than their engineered counterparts. We show that providing geometric details
increases the number of task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL
descriptions, and that (faster) non-reasoning LLM variants outperform (slower)
reasoning variants in most cases, since the TAMP system can direct the LLM to
correct its mistakes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合NMPC-DNN和PI控制器的混合控制器（Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI），解决了NMPC-DNN在意外干扰或训练数据之外的条件下鲁棒性不足的问题，应用于外骨骼机器人，显著降低了跟踪误差和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NMPC计算量大，NMPC-DNN在意外干扰或训练数据外的条件下鲁棒性不足，导致跟踪误差大。目标是设计一种更鲁棒且计算高效的控制方法。

Method: 结合NMPC-DNN输出与PI控制器，提出Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI控制器，并将其应用于具有复杂动力学模型的外骨骼机器人，使用超过530万个训练样本训练DNN。

Result: 在训练数据之外的条件，Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI的跟踪误差显著低于NMPC-DNN，并且人类关节扭矩大幅降低（踝、膝、髋分别减少30.9%、41.8%、29.7%），计算成本降低99.93%。

Conclusion: Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI在保持控制精度的同时，显著提升了鲁棒性和计算效率，适用于复杂动力学系统的实时控制。

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a precise controller, but its
heavy computational load often prevents application in robotic systems. Some
studies have attempted to approximate NMPC using deep neural networks
(NMPC-DNN). However, in the presence of unexpected disturbances or when
operating conditions differ from training data, this approach lacks robustness,
leading to large tracking errors. To address this issue, for the first time,
the NMPC-DNN output is combined with a PI controller (Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI). The
proposed controller is validated by applying it to an exoskeleton robot during
squat movement, which has a complex dynamic model and has received limited
attention regarding robust nonlinear control design. A human-robot dynamic
model with three active joints (ankle, knee, hip) is developed, and more than
5.3 million training samples are used to train the DNN. The results show that,
under unseen conditions for the DNN, the tracking error in Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI
is significantly lower compared to NMPC-DNN. Moreover, human joint torques are
greatly reduced with the use of the exoskeleton, with RMS values for the
studied case reduced by 30.9%, 41.8%, and 29.7% at the ankle, knee, and hip,
respectively. In addition, the computational cost of Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI is
99.93% lower than that of NMPC.

TL;DR: TGPO（Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization）是一种解决通用STL任务的分层强化学习方法，通过分解STL为时间子目标和约束，显著提升了复杂任务的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对STL语言的非马尔可夫特性和稀疏奖励问题，传统RL方法难以有效解决复杂任务，需要一种新方法来分解和优化任务。

Method: TGPO将STL任务分解为时间子目标和不变约束，采用分层框架：高层分配时间，低层学习策略，并利用Metropolis-Hastings采样优化时间分配。

Result: TGPO在五种环境中（包括导航、操作、无人机和四足运动）显著优于基线，任务成功率平均提升31.6%。

Conclusion: TGPO通过分层设计和时间优化，为复杂STL任务提供了一种高效的解决方案，尤其在长时程和高维任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Learning control policies for complex, long-horizon tasks is a central
challenge in robotics and autonomous systems. Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its
non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved
via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus
only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal
rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization,
to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and
invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the
problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations
for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve
the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During
inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising
assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster
efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage
the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via
Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible
solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from
low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion.
Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon
cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to
the best baseline. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BC-MPPI是一种轻量级的安全层，为MPPI控制提供概率约束，确保轨迹可行性，无需手动调整或样本拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MPPI控制在高度非线性任务中缺乏硬性约束保证的问题。

Method: 通过概率代理评估候选轨迹的可行性，自动调整权重，训练代理并部署在四旋翼无人机上。

Result: BC-MPPI在保留安全裕度的同时满足违规概率要求，适用于不同数量的滚动样本。

Conclusion: BC-MPPI可自然集成到认证自动驾驶系统的验证与验证流程中。

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has recently emerged as a fast,
gradient-free alternative to model-predictive control in highly non-linear
robotic tasks, yet it offers no hard guarantees on constraint satisfaction. We
introduce Bayesian-Constraints MPPI (BC-MPPI), a lightweight safety layer that
attaches a probabilistic surrogate to every state and input constraint. At each
re-planning step the surrogate returns the probability that a candidate
trajectory is feasible; this joint probability scales the weight given to a
candidate, automatically down-weighting rollouts likely to collide or exceed
limits and pushing the sampling distribution toward the safe subset; no
hand-tuned penalty costs or explicit sample rejection required. We train the
surrogate from 1000 offline simulations and deploy the controller on a
quadrotor in MuJoCo with both static and moving obstacles. Across K in
[100,1500] rollouts BC-MPPI preserves safety margins while satisfying the
prescribed probability of violation. Because the surrogate is a stand-alone,
version-controlled artefact and the runtime safety score is a single scalar,
the approach integrates naturally with verification-and-validation pipelines
for certifiable autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用MO-IRL减少传统逆向强化学习所需的演示数据量和收敛时间，并揭示人类运动控制的动态成本结构。

Method: 使用平面双关节生物力学模型和高分辨率动作捕捉数据，将轨迹分段并学习分段特定的七种成本函数组合。

Conclusion: MO-IRL能高效揭示人类运动的动态成本结构，适用于人形机器人等领域。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Minimal Observation Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL) to model and predict human arm-reaching
movements with time-varying cost weights. Using a planar two-link biomechanical
model and high-resolution motion-capture data from subjects performing a
pointing task, we segment each trajectory into multiple phases and learn
phase-specific combinations of seven candidate cost functions. MO-IRL
iteratively refines cost weights by scaling observed and generated trajectories
in the maximum entropy IRL formulation, greatly reducing the number of required
demonstrations and convergence time compared to classical IRL approaches.
Training on ten trials per posture yields average joint-angle Root Mean Squared
Errors (RMSE) of 6.4 deg and 5.6 deg for six- and eight-segment weight
divisions, respectively, versus 10.4 deg using a single static weight.
Cross-validation on remaining trials and, for the first time, inter-subject
validation on an unseen subject's 20 trials, demonstrates comparable predictive
accuracy, around 8 deg RMSE, indicating robust generalization. Learned weights
emphasize joint acceleration minimization during movement onset and
termination, aligning with smoothness principles observed in biological motion.
These results suggest that MO-IRL can efficiently uncover dynamic,
subject-independent cost structures underlying human motor control, with
potential applications for humanoid robots.

Method: 提出DiSA-IQL方法，扩展了IQL，引入鲁棒性调制机制以减轻分布偏移。

Result: DiSA-IQL在仿真实验中优于基线模型，表现为更高的成功率、更平滑的轨迹和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DiSA-IQL为解决软体机器人控制中的分布偏移问题提供了有效方案，代码已开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Soft snake robots offer remarkable flexibility and adaptability in complex
environments, yet their control remains challenging due to highly nonlinear
dynamics. Existing model-based and bio-inspired controllers rely on simplified
assumptions that limit performance. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has
recently emerged as a promising alternative, but online training is often
impractical because of costly and potentially damaging real-world interactions.
Offline RL provides a safer option by leveraging pre-collected datasets, but it
suffers from distribution shift, which degrades generalization to unseen
scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose DiSA-IQL
(Distribution-Shift-Aware Implicit Q-Learning), an extension of IQL that
incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs
to mitigate distribution shift. We evaluate DiSA-IQL on goal-reaching tasks
across two settings: in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation.
Simulation results show that DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms baseline models,
including Behavior Cloning (BC), Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and vanilla
IQL, achieving higher success rates, smoother trajectories, and improved
robustness. The codes are open-sourced to support reproducibility and to
facilitate further research in offline RL for soft robot control.

Conclusion: PINCoDE是一种高效、可扩展的轨迹预测方法，结合物理约束和目标条件，适用于多机器人系统的长时程预测。

Abstract: Long-horizon motion forecasting for multiple autonomous robots is challenging
due to non-linear agent interactions, compounding prediction errors, and
continuous-time evolution of dynamics. Learned dynamics of such a system can be
useful in various applications such as travel time prediction,
prediction-guided planning and generative simulation. In this work, we aim to
develop an efficient trajectory forecasting model conditioned on multi-agent
goals. Motivated by the recent success of physics-guided deep learning for
partially known dynamical systems, we develop a model based on neural
Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) for long-horizon motion forecasting.
Unlike discrete-time methods such as RNNs and transformers, neural CDEs operate
in continuous time, allowing us to combine physics-informed constraints and
biases to jointly model multi-robot dynamics. Our approach, named PINCoDE
(Physics-Informed Neural Controlled Differential Equations), learns
differential equation parameters that can be used to predict the trajectories
of a multi-agent system starting from an initial condition. PINCoDE is
conditioned on future goals and enforces physics constraints for robot motion
over extended periods of time. We adopt a strategy that scales our model from
10 robots to 100 robots without the need for additional model parameters, while
producing predictions with an average ADE below 0.5 m for a 1-minute horizon.
Furthermore, progressive training with curriculum learning for our PINCoDE
model results in a 2.7X reduction of forecasted pose error over 4 minute
horizons compared to analytical models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLA模型依赖模仿学习，导致错误累积和分布偏移下的鲁棒性差。RL虽能缓解问题，但成本高或存在sim-to-real差距。

Method: 提出VLA-RFT框架，利用数据驱动的世界模型模拟未来视觉观察，并通过目标达成参考生成密集奖励信号进行策略微调。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的RFT是一种实用后训练范式，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable embodied decision-making but rely
heavily on imitation learning, leading to compounding errors and poor
robustness under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate
these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers
from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning
framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator.
Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual
observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense,
trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design
delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering
sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses
strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than
simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed
conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish
world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the
generalization and robustness of VLA models. For more details, please refer to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉导航在AI中很重要，但数据稀缺导致模型过拟合并泛化能力差，现有神经网络方法在小样本情况下表现不佳。

Method: NeuRO利用PICNN将噪声视觉预测转化为凸不确定性集，并通过鲁棒优化重新规划部分可观测性问题。

Result: 实验表明NeuRO在多目标导航任务中表现优异，尤其在未见环境的泛化能力上达到SoTA。

Conclusion: NeuRO提出了一种创新框架，显著提升了自主代理的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical
deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address
multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned
from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural
network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that
paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper
introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly
couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization.
Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it
transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty
sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal
calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii)
it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization
problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments.
Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation
tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in
generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant
advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for
addressing robot social navigation challenges. However, inherent uncertainties
in pedestrian behavior and limited environmental interaction during training
often lead to suboptimal exploration and distributional shifts between offline
training and online deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes a novel offline-to-online fine-tuning RL algorithm for robot social
navigation by integrating Return-to-Go (RTG) prediction into a causal
Transformer architecture. Our algorithm features a spatiotem-poral fusion model
designed to precisely estimate RTG values in real-time by jointly encoding
temporal pedestrian motion patterns and spatial crowd dynamics. This RTG
prediction framework mitigates distribution shift by aligning offline policy
training with online environmental interactions. Furthermore, a hybrid
offline-online experience sampling mechanism is built to stabilize policy
updates during fine-tuning, ensuring balanced integration of pre-trained
knowledge and real-time adaptation. Extensive experiments in simulated social
navigation environments demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success
rate and lower collision rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These
results underscore the efficacy of our algorithm in enhancing navigation policy
robustness and adaptability. This work paves the way for more reliable and
adaptive robotic navigation systems in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Traj2Action有效解决了形态差异问题，显著提升了机器人从人类数据中学习技能的性能。

Abstract: Learning diverse manipulation skills for real-world robots is severely
bottlenecked by the reliance on costly and hard-to-scale teleoperated
demonstrations. While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively
transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the
significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address
this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce
Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D
trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate
representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this
trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse
trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and
robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific
actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework.
Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action
boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short-
and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data
scales in robot policy learning. Our project website, featuring code and video

Motivation: 复杂环境中GNSS定位受到NLOS传播、多径效应和信号遮挡等影响，导致伪距测量中存在大量异常值，影响了RTK定位和多源集成导航系统的性能。

Method: 提出了两阶段异常值检测方法：第一阶段利用多普勒测量检测伪距异常值；第二阶段利用IMU和里程计约束生成预测伪距测量，进一步剔除异常值。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著降低了伪距异常值的影响，在深度城市峡谷测试中，GNSS-RTK/INS/里程计融合的RMSE从0.52米降至0.30米，提高了42.3%。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段检测方法有效提升了GNSS定位在复杂环境中的鲁棒性和精度。

Abstract: Reliable GNSS positioning in complex environments remains a critical
challenge due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, multipath effects, and
frequent signal blockages. These effects can easily introduce large outliers
into the raw pseudo-range measurements, which significantly degrade the
performance of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic
(RTK) positioning and limit the effectiveness of tightly coupled GNSS-based
integrated navigation system. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage
outlier detection method and apply the method in a tightly coupled GNSS-RTK,
inertial navigation system (INS), and odometer integration based on factor
graph optimization (FGO). In the first stage, Doppler measurements are employed
to detect pseudo-range outliers in a GNSS-only manner, since Doppler is less
sensitive to multipath and NLOS effects compared with pseudo-range, making it a
more stable reference for detecting sudden inconsistencies. In the second
stage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints
are used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements,
which enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers.
By combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved
robustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite
measuring quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage
detection framework significantly reduces the impact of pseudo-range outliers,
and leads to improved positioning accuracy and consistency compared with
representative baseline approaches. In the deep urban canyon test, the outlier
mitigation method has limits the RMSE of GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion from 0.52
m to 0.30 m, with 42.3% improvement.

Conclusion: GRITS有效减少了食物溢出，提高了舀取任务的可靠性。

Abstract: Robotic food scooping is a critical manipulation skill for food preparation
and service robots. However, existing robot learning algorithms, especially
learn-from-demonstration methods, still struggle to handle diverse and dynamic
food states, which often results in spillage and reduced reliability. In this
work, we introduce GRITS: A Spillage-Aware Guided Diffusion Policy for Robot
Food Scooping Tasks. This framework leverages guided diffusion policy to
minimize food spillage during scooping and to ensure reliable transfer of food
items from the initial to the target location. Specifically, we design a
spillage predictor that estimates the probability of spillage given current
observation and action rollout. The predictor is trained on a simulated dataset
with food spillage scenarios, constructed from four primitive shapes (spheres,
cubes, cones, and cylinders) with varied physical properties such as mass,
friction, and particle size. At inference time, the predictor serves as a
differentiable guidance signal, steering the diffusion sampling process toward
safer trajectories while preserving task success. We validate GRITS on a
real-world robotic food scooping platform. GRITS is trained on six food
categories and evaluated on ten unseen categories with different shapes and
quantities. GRITS achieves an 82% task success rate and a 4% spillage rate,
reducing spillage by over 40% compared to baselines without guidance, thereby
demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: HyT在保持性能的同时优化了推理效率，提供了更高的灵活性。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a.
Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe
for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT
strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to
improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these
techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the
thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's
actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly
affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions.
However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for
achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid
Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and
benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility
to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to
conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at
inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate
thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of
simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶功能依赖机器学习，但其性能受训练数据匹配度影响。为确保可靠运行，需评估训练模型的覆盖范围和操作风险。

Result: 应用于NuPlan数据集，分析了特定驾驶场景的覆盖率，有助于监控机器学习模型的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了自动驾驶中AI的可信度，通过可解释的数据集描述和能力评估，推动了安全部署。

Abstract: Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks
like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets.
The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data
matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is
included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim
to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing
a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been
sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing
the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data
as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their
relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations
to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in
a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene
configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater
coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset,
modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific
driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning
models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be
deployed in automated driving.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于优化的方法（TBOD），用于设计非线性系统和多传感器设置的观测器，并通过数值优化调整观测器参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效的观测器设计和精确的传感器融合在状态估计中至关重要。

Result: TBOD在陆地漫游车定位问题中表现优异，位置估计精度与扩展卡尔曼滤波器相当，但在方向上显著提升。

Conclusion: TBOD提供了一种轻量级、通用的传感器融合方法，具有模块化和易于调试的特点。

Abstract: Efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion are key in state
estimation. This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed
Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design
observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from
parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of
pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them
to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research
hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators
methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing
the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's
main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently
and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning
procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization
problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band
antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an
Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation
accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.

Result: EV-Pose旋转精度1.34°，平移精度6.9mm，延迟10.08ms，优于基线50%以上。

Conclusion: EV-Pose显著提升了无人机着陆的精度和效率。

Abstract: After years of growth, drone-based delivery is transforming logistics. At its
core, real-time 6-DoF drone pose tracking enables precise flight control and
accurate drone landing. With the widespread availability of urban 3D maps, the
Visual Positioning Service (VPS), a mobile pose estimation system, has been
adapted to enhance drone pose tracking during the landing phase, as
conventional systems like GPS are unreliable in urban environments due to
signal attenuation and multi-path propagation. However, deploying the current
VPS on drones faces limitations in both estimation accuracy and efficiency. In
this work, we redesign drone-oriented VPS with the event camera and introduce
EV-Pose to enable accurate, high-frequency 6-DoF pose tracking for accurate
drone landing. EV-Pose introduces a spatio-temporal feature-instructed pose
estimation module that extracts a temporal distance field to enable 3D point
map matching for pose estimation; and a motion-aware hierarchical fusion and
optimization scheme to enhance the above estimation in accuracy and efficiency,
by utilizing drone motion in the \textit{early stage} of event filtering and
the \textit{later stage} of pose optimization. Evaluation shows that EV-Pose
achieves a rotation accuracy of 1.34$\degree$ and a translation accuracy of
6.9$mm$ with a tracking latency of 10.08$ms$, outperforming baselines by
$>$50\%, \tmcrevise{thus enabling accurate drone landings.} Demo:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HAMLET是一个可扩展的框架，通过引入时间对比学习和轻量级内存模块，使Vision-Language-Action模型能够利用历史上下文进行动作预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数Vision-Language-Action模型忽略历史上下文，而机器人操作任务往往依赖于历史背景。HAMLET旨在填补这一空白。

Method: HAMLET通过时间对比学习初始化moment tokens的表征，并使用轻量级内存模块整合过去时刻的信息，以提高动作预测的准确性。

Result: HAMLET显著提升了长时任务的表现，如在GR00T N1.5上实现了76.4%的成功率，比基线提升47.2%。

Conclusion: HAMLET成功地将历史上下文引入VLAs，显著提升了模型在依赖历史的任务中的表现。

Abstract: Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past
context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action
models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they
rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this
paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the
historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment
tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their
representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them
to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight
memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into
memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through
empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a
state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating
significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.
In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of
76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline
performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from
64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on
LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation
benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决监督学习中策略遇到未覆盖的执行变体时性能下降的问题。

Method: 结合状态转换注意力机制和训练时的时序掩码，增强模型对历史上下文的时序推理能力。

Result: 在仿真实验中，STA模型性能优于标准交叉注意力和TCN、LSTM网络，在精度关键任务上提升超2倍。

Conclusion: STA机制有效提升了机器人策略的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies through supervised learning from
demonstrations remains challenging when policies encounter execution variations
not explicitly covered during training. While incorporating historical context
through attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches
process all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal
structure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery
patterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that
employs a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard
attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies
to better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach
combines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where
visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage
temporal reasoning from historical context. Evaluation in simulation shows that
STA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling
approaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x
improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.

Abstract: Semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical area of
research within robotics and computer vision, focusing on the simultaneous
localization of robotic systems and associating semantic information to

Conclusion: RTFF策略为布料平整和对齐提供了一种高效的解决方案，展示了在实际应用中的潜力和通用性。

Abstract: Robotic fabric manipulation in garment production for sewing, cutting, and
ironing requires reliable flattening and alignment, yet remains challenging due
to fabric deformability, effectively infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent
occlusions from wrinkles, folds, and the manipulator's End-Effector (EE) and
arm. To address these issues, this paper proposes the first Random-to-Target
Fabric Flattening (RTFF) policy, which aligns a random wrinkled fabric state to
an arbitrary wrinkle-free target state. The proposed policy adopts a hybrid
Imitation Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework, where IL learns with
explicit fabric models for coarse alignment of the wrinkled fabric toward a
wrinkle-free state near the target, and VS ensures fine alignment to the
target. Central to this framework is a template-based mesh that offers precise
target state representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent
vertex correspondence across RTFF manipulation steps, enabling robust
manipulation and seamless IL-VS switching. Leveraging the power of mesh, a
novel IL solution for RTFF-Mesh Action Chunking Transformer (MACT)-is then
proposed by conditioning the mesh information into a Transformer-based policy.
The RTFF policy is validated on a real dual-arm tele-operation system, showing
zero-shot alignment to different targets, high accuracy, and strong
generalization across fabrics and scales. Project website:

Result: 提出了PoPAN模型，并通过电动汽车电池的拆解和再制造用例验证了其有效性，模型采用AutomationML数据格式序列化。

Conclusion: PoPAN模型能够伴随产品整个生命周期，支持可持续性生产实践。

Abstract: Current products, especially in the automotive sector, pose complex technical
systems having a multi-disciplinary mechatronic nature. Industrial standards
supporting system engineering and production typically (i) address the
production phase only, but do not cover the complete product life cycle, and
(ii) focus on production processes and resources rather than the products
themselves. The presented approach is motivated by incorporating impacts of
end-of-life phase of the product life cycle into the engineering phase. This
paper proposes a modelling approach coming up from the Product-Process-Resource
(PPR) modeling paradigm. It combines requirements on (i) respecting the product
structure as a basis for the model, and (ii) it incorporates repairing,
remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems. The
proposed model called PoPAN should accompany the product during the entire life
cycle as a digital shadow encapsulated within the Asset Administration Shell of
a product. To facilitate the adoption of the proposed paradigm, the paper also
proposes serialization of the model in the AutomationML data format. The model
is demonstrated on a use-case for disassembling electric vehicle batteries to
support their remanufacturing for stationary battery applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为VIN系统提供了高效且实用的解决方案，平衡了计算复杂性和导航性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a task-oriented computational framework to enhance
Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) in robots, addressing challenges such as
limited time and energy resources. The framework strategically selects visual
features using a Mean Squared Error (MSE)-based, non-submodular objective
function and a simplified dynamic anticipation model. To address the
NP-hardness of this problem, we introduce four polynomial-time approximation
algorithms: a classic greedy method with constant-factor guarantees; a low-rank
greedy variant that significantly reduces computational complexity; a
randomized greedy sampler that balances efficiency and solution quality; and a
linearization-based selector based on a first-order Taylor expansion for
near-constant-time execution. We establish rigorous performance bounds by
leveraging submodularity ratios, curvature, and element-wise curvature
analyses. Extensive experiments on both standardized benchmarks and a custom
control-aware platform validate our theoretical results, demonstrating that
these methods achieve strong approximation guarantees while enabling real-time
deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action
(VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant
capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of
acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative
paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.
Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the
performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of
distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior
one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A
Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement
propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic
performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General
Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by
combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a
convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the
plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA
models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of
their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical
validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside
real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves
performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of
alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into
the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a
simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging
existing policies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种实时、计算效率高的非线性阻力补偿轨迹生成方法及其配套的Lyapunov控制器，以实现跳跃机器人在起飞和着陆时对复杂空中轨迹的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跳跃机器人在空中轨迹控制和飞行转换方面存在不足，无法充分发挥其效率优势，因此需要一种更高效的控制方法。

Method: 采用非线性阻力补偿的轨迹生成算法和Lyapunov控制器，确保机器人能够在水平和垂直表面上精准控制着陆姿态。

Result: 该系统成功实现了复杂空中轨迹的生成和跟踪，同时在着陆时能够严格控制机器人的方向。

Conclusion: 该方法计算效率高，适用于不同尺寸的跳跃机器人，并具有广泛的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The advent of rotor-based hopping robots has created very capable hopping
platforms with high agility and efficiency, and similar controllability, as
compared to their purely flying quadrotor counterparts. Advances in robot
performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and
opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e.,
behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their
aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits
of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency,
non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying
Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex
aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical
surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown.
The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size
scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in
general.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了DiffAU方法，通过扩散模型将一阶Ambisonics（FOA）升级为三阶Ambisonics（HOA），提升空间音频的沉浸感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FOA虽然硬件效率高，但其低空间分辨率限制了真实感，因此需要升级方法以提高Ambisonics信号的阶数。

Method: 采用基于扩散模型的级联方法DiffAU，结合空间音频的新适配，从FOA生成HOA。

Result: 在无回声环境中多扬声器实验中，DiffAU表现出优异的客观和感知性能。

Conclusion: DiffAU提供了一种高效可靠的FOA升级方法，提升了空间音频的沉浸效果。

Abstract: Spatial audio enhances immersion by reproducing 3D sound fields, with
Ambisonics offering a scalable format for this purpose. While first-order
Ambisonics (FOA) notably facilitates hardware-efficient acquisition and storage
of sound fields as compared to high-order Ambisonics (HOA), its low spatial
resolution limits realism, highlighting the need for Ambisonics upscaling (AU)
as an approach for increasing the order of Ambisonics signals. In this work we
propose DiffAU, a cascaded AU method that leverages recent developments in
diffusion models combined with novel adaptation to spatial audio to generate
3rd order Ambisonics from FOA. By learning data distributions, DiffAU provides
a principled approach that rapidly and reliably reproduces HOA in various
settings. Experiments in anechoic conditions with multiple speakers, show
strong objective and perceptual performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无声码器的音频超分辨率框架，直接通过逆短时傅里叶变换重构波形，避免了传统方法中对声码器的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练的神经声码器，限制了最终音频质量，新方法旨在简化优化流程并提升质量。

Method: 使用流匹配生成模型捕捉复杂值谱系数的条件分布，通过逆短时傅里叶变换直接重构波形。

Result: 实验表明，模型在多种上采样因子下均能生成48 kHz高保真音频，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架避免了声码器的瓶颈，实现了端到端优化，并在多种数据集上达到了领先性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a vocoder-free framework for audio super-resolution
that employs a flow matching generative model to capture the conditional
distribution of complex-valued spectral coefficients. Unlike conventional
two-stage diffusion-based approaches that predict a mel-spectrogram and then
rely on a pre-trained neural vocoder to synthesize waveforms, our method
directly reconstructs waveforms via the inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform
(iSTFT), thereby eliminating the dependence on a separate vocoder. This design
not only simplifies end-to-end optimization but also overcomes a critical
bottleneck of two-stage pipelines, where the final audio quality is
fundamentally constrained by vocoder performance. Experiments show that our
model consistently produces high-fidelity 48 kHz audio across diverse
upsampling factors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both speech and
general audio datasets.

Motivation: 为了填补现有研究中缺乏真实世界数据的空白，并了解行人对AV的真实反应。

Method: 在Robotaxi商业运营区进行真实实验，33名参与者多次穿过无控制交叉口，并通过问卷调查评估信任和接受度。

Result: 实验后行人对AV的信任显著增加，且与PRQF的互动组件正相关。PBQ的正向和错误子量表也显著影响信任变化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了真实世界中行人-AV互动中信任的形成，考虑了人群异质性，提供了超越实验室研究的见解。

Abstract: This study investigates how pedestrian trust, receptivity, and behavior
evolve during interactions with Level-4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) at
uncontrolled urban intersections in a naturalistic setting. While public
acceptance is critical for AV adoption, most prior studies relied on simplified
simulations or field tests. We conducted a real-world experiment in a
commercial Robotaxi operation zone, where 33 participants repeatedly crossed an
uncontrolled intersection with frequent Level-4 Robotaxi traffic. Participants
completed the Pedestrian Behavior Questionnaire (PBQ), Pedestrian Receptivity
Questionnaire for Fully AVs (PRQF), pre- and post-experiment Trust in AVs
Scale, and Personal Innovativeness Scale (PIS). Results showed that trust in
AVs significantly increased post-experiment, with the increase positively
associated with the Interaction component of PRQF. Additionally, both the
Positive and Error subscales of the PBQ significantly influenced trust change.
This study reveals how trust forms in real-world pedestrian-AV encounters,
offering insights beyond lab-based research by accounting for population
heterogeneity.

Abstract: Autonomous inspection systems are essential for ensuring the performance and
longevity of industrial assets. Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated
significant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited
to digital tasks. Their application to physical assets in real-world
environments, however, remains underexplored. In this work, our contributions
are two-fold: first, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous
drone control, and second, a reasoning methodology for individual function
executions which we refer to as ReActEval. Our framework focuses on visual
inspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial
readouts or inspecting equipment. It employs a multi-agent system comprising a
head agent and multiple worker agents, each controlling a single drone. The
head agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while worker
agents implement ReActEval to reason over and execute low-level actions.
Operating entirely in natural language, ReActEval follows a plan, reason, act,
evaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation
(e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level tasks (e.g.,
locating and reading a pressure gauge). The evaluation phase serves as a
feedback and/or replanning stage, ensuring actions align with user objectives
while preventing undesirable outcomes. We evaluate the framework in a simulated
environment with two worker agents, assessing performance qualitatively and
quantitatively based on task completion across varying complexity levels and
workflow efficiency. By leveraging natural language processing for agent
communication, our approach offers a novel, flexible, and user-accessible
alternative to traditional drone-based solutions, enabling autonomous
problem-solving for industrial inspection without extensive user intervention.

Motivation: 未来环境中，不同厂商的机器人如何在共享空间内高效协作是一个关键问题。

Method: 采用CBS作为中央规划器，要求各机器人提供满足时空约束的无碰撞路径API，兼容多种单机器人规划算法。

Result: 实现了异构多机器人团队的高效无碰撞运动规划，兼容了包括A*、RRT等多种规划算法。

Conclusion: CBS协议为解决异构多机器人系统的协作规划问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Imagine the future construction site, hospital, office, or even sophisticated
household with dozens of robots bought from different manufacturers. How can we
enable these different systems to effectively move in a shared environment,
given that each robot may have its own independent motion planning system? This
work shows how we can get efficient collision-free movements between
algorithmically heterogeneous agents by using Conflict-Based Search (Sharon et
al. 2015) as a protocol. At its core, the CBS Protocol requires one specific
single-agent motion planning API; finding a collision-free path that satisfies
certain space-time constraints. Given such an API, CBS uses a central planner
to find collision-free paths - independent of how the API is implemented. We
show how this protocol enables multi-agent motion planning for a heterogeneous
team of agents completing independent tasks with a variety of single-agent
planners including: Heuristic Search (e.g., A*), Sampling Based Search (e.g.,
RRT), Optimization (e.g., Direct Collocation), Diffusion, and Reinforcement
Learning.

Method: 使用广义权重归一化（WN）并结合黎曼优化方法，分析了其在矩阵感知问题中的应用。

Result: 证明了WN能实现线性收敛，并在迭代和样本复杂度上带来多项式级改进。

Conclusion: 本文首次揭示了WN如何利用过参数化加速矩阵感知问题的收敛。

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

Motivation: 高光谱异常检测在许多军民应用中至关重要，但由于复杂环境和缺乏先验知识，现有方法面临挑战。

Method: 提出运输模型描述高光谱像素，将其视为模板模式的变形观测，并在SCDT域中构建背景信号的子空间模型，检测异常为与模型的偏差。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的评估表明，该方法优于当前最先进技术。

Conclusion: 基于运输模型的HAD方法是一种高效的无监督技术，适用于复杂环境中的异常检测。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will

Conclusion: 该研究的基准和模型为提升真实世界中第一人称视角轨迹预测的鲁棒性奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Result: 在四个基准测试中，KeySG在3D对象分割和复杂查询检索等任务上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: KeySG通过分层结构和多模态信息增强，显著提升了3D场景图的语义丰富性和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are

Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw

framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了无人机在突发情况下的自适应决策问题，提出利用具身AI和视觉语言模型提升实时决策能力，优于传统手动编码方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在突发情况（如警报、故障或环境变化）下需要快速自适应决策，传统手动编码方法无法覆盖所有可能情况，限制了自主系统的安全性和弹性。

Method: 采用具身AI和大型视觉语言模型，模拟城市环境（Unreal Engine）中无人机的动态决策过程，特别是紧急着陆的场景。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了传统手动编码无法完成的自适应决策流程，显著提升了自主飞行系统的安全性和弹性。

Conclusion: 具身AI为无人机提供了一种新颖的自适应决策方案，解决了传统方法的局限性，推动了自主航空系统的安全发展。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在不确定环境中的姿态稳定面临非线性动力学、参数变化和传感器限制等挑战，需要更鲁棒的控制器。

Method: 使用线性参数变化（LPV）框架建模飞行动力学，将非线性和参数变化转化为结构化不确定性，并设计基于$ℓ_∞$的鲁棒控制器。

Result: 非线性仿真结果显示，$ℓ_∞$控制器在严重风力扰动下的姿态调节性能显著优于PID控制器。

Conclusion: $ℓ_∞$控制器在多旋翼飞行器姿态稳定方面表现更优，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Attitude stabilization of unmanned aerial vehicles in uncertain environments
presents significant challenges due to nonlinear dynamics, parameter
variations, and sensor limitations. This paper presents a comparative study of
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ and classical PID controllers for multi-rotor attitude
regulation in the presence of wind disturbances and gyroscope noise. The flight
dynamics are modeled using a linear parameter-varying (LPV) framework, where
nonlinearities and parameter variations are systematically represented as
structured uncertainties within a linear fractional transformation formulation.
A robust controller based on $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ formulation is designed using
only gyroscope measurements to ensure guaranteed performance bounds. Nonlinear
simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the robust controllers
compared to classical PID control, showing significant improvement in attitude
regulation under severe wind disturbances.

Main category: eess.SY

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验验证了PCBF在输入延迟的离散时间双积分器和具有位置约束的双翼直升机系统中的有效性。

Conclusion: PCBF框架通过消除辅助函数需求，简化了约束执行过程，并能够更好地处理相对阶未知的系统。

Abstract: This paper introduces a predictive control barrier function (PCBF) framework
for enforcing state constraints in discrete-time systems with unknown relative
degree, which can be caused by input delays or unmodeled input dynamics.
Existing discrete-time CBF formulations typically require the construction of
auxiliary barrier functions when the relative degree is greater than one, which
complicates implementation and may yield conservative safe sets. The proposed
PCBF framework addresses this challenge by extending the prediction horizon to
construct a CBF for an associated system with relative degree one. As a result,
the superlevel set of the PCBF coincides with the safe set, simplifying
constraint enforcement and eliminating the need for auxiliary functions. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a discrete-time double
integrator with input delay and a bicopter system with position constraints.

Conclusion: 当前错误控制的新颖性检测方法存在根本局限性，需要开发更鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper studies the adversarial robustness of conformal novelty detection.
In particular, we focus on AdaDetect, a powerful learning-based framework for
novelty detection with finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control. While
AdaDetect provides rigorous statistical guarantees under benign conditions, its
behavior under adversarial perturbations remains unexplored. We first formulate
an oracle attack setting that quantifies the worst-case degradation of FDR,
deriving an upper bound that characterizes the statistical cost of attacks.
This idealized formulation directly motivates a practical and effective attack
scheme that only requires query access to AdaDetect's output labels. Coupling
these formulations with two popular and complementary black-box adversarial
algorithms, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of AdaDetect on
synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that adversarial
perturbations can significantly increase the FDR while maintaining high
detection power, exposing fundamental limitations of current error-controlled
novelty detection methods and motivating the development of more robust
alternatives.
