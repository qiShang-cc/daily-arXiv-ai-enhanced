### [1] [Derivative-Free Optimization-Empowered Wireless Channel Reconfiguration for 6G](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02243)
*Peilan Wang,Jun Fang,Xianlong Zeng,Bin Wang,Zhi Chen,Yonina C. Eldar*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可重构天线系数实时优化中的复杂建模和隐式参数估计问题。

Conclusion: 无导数优化在可重构天线技术中具有潜力，未来研究方向广阔。

Abstract: Reconfigurable antennas, including reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS),
movable antenna (MA), fluid antenna (FA), and other advanced antenna
techniques, have been studied extensively in the context of reshaping wireless
propagation environments for 6G and beyond wireless communications.
Nevertheless, how to reconfigure/optimize the real-time controllable
coefficients to achieve a favorable end-to-end wireless channel remains a
substantial challenge, as it usually requires accurate modeling of the complex
interaction between the reconfigurable devices and the electromagnetic waves,
as well as knowledge of implicit channel propagation parameters. In this paper,
we introduce a derivative-free optimization (a.k.a., zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization) technique to directly optimize reconfigurable coefficients to
shape the wireless end-to-end channel, without the need of channel modeling and
estimation of the implicit environmental propagation parameters. We present the
fundamental principles of ZO optimization and discuss its potential advantages
in wireless channel reconfiguration. Two case studies for RIS and movable
antenna-enabled single-input single-output (SISO) systems are provided to show
the superiority of ZO-based methods as compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
Finally, we outline promising future research directions and offer concluding
insights on derivative-free optimization for reconfigurable antenna
technologies.

### [2] [Localized kernel method for separation of linear chirps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02262)
*Eric Mason,Sippanon Kitimoon,Hrushikesh Mhaskar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文扩展并改进了Chui和Mhaskar的信号分离算子（SSO）方法，用于在交叉、低信噪比和不连续情况下分离线性调频信号，并进行了理论分析和数值验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信号处理中，分离叠加信号的各个成分是一个常见挑战，尤其是在音频和雷达信号领域。本文旨在改进现有方法以应对更复杂的信号环境。

Method: 通过扩展和改进SSO方法，分析噪声环境下最小分离距离、最小振幅、信噪比和采样频率之间的关系，并在模拟数据集上进行验证。

Result: 在包含7个模拟信号的数据集上，展示了改进方法的效果，并提供了数值结果。

Conclusion: 改进的SSO方法能够有效处理复杂环境下的线性调频信号分离问题，理论分析为方法的应用提供了指导。

Abstract: The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual
components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing
applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous
paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator
(SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such
superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In
this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp
signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We
give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to
examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude,
SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and
numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated
signals.

Abstract: This study examines an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
transceiver featuring a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable
intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and a receiver equipped with a passive
electronically scanned array (PESA) and a single digital channel. By utilizing
a periodic pulsed signal emitted by a feeder, we introduce at the STAR-RIS a
space modulation to illuminate two angular directions observed by the radar
receiver, one in each half-space, and a time modulation to distinguish the
corresponding echoes from prospective moving targets and embed communication
messages. The proposed time modulation employs orthogonal binary codebooks with
different trade-offs in transmission and error rates, while having minimal
impact on the radar performance, evaluated by probability of detection and root
mean square error in the radial velocity estimation.

### [4] [Joint Radiation Power, Antenna Position, and Beamforming Optimization for Pinching-Antenna Systems with Motion Power Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02348)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了考虑天线运动功耗和可调辐射功率的Pinching-antenna系统（PASS）设计，通过联合优化天线位置、辐射功率比和传输波束成形，在满足服务质量要求下最小化平均功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽略了天线放置的物理约束和固定辐射功率假设，本文填补了考虑运动功耗和可调辐射功率的研究空白。

Method: 提出基于ADMM的框架优化连续天线移动问题，离散问题则建模为MINLP并通过BCD方法求解。

Result: 仿真结果表明，考虑运动功耗和可调辐射功率显著提升了PASS性能，并验证了优化框架的高效性。

Conclusion: PASS在减少大尺度路径损耗和用户间干扰方面优于传统MIMO系统，提供了额外的设计自由度。

Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have been recently proposed to improve the
performance of wireless networks by reconfiguring both the large-scale and
small-scale channel conditions. However, existing studies ignore the physical
constraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To
fill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into
account the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact
of adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average
power consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly
optimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit
beamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to
consider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional
degree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and
discrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the
fact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the
channel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To
tackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for
continuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a
mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block
coordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance
enhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and
adjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the
efficiency of the proposed optimization framework. The benefits of PASS over
conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in mitigating the
large-scale path loss and inter-user interference is also revealed.

Abstract: This study considers a base station equipped with sensing and communication
capabilities, which serves a ground user and scans a portion of the sky via a
passive reconfigurable intelligent surface. To achieve more favorable system
tradeoffs, we utilize a multi-frame radar detector, comprising a detector, a
plot-extractor, and a track-before-detect processor. The main idea proposed
here is that user spectral efficiency can be enhanced by increasing the number
of scans jointly processed by the multi-frame radar detector while maintaining
the same sensing performance. A numerical analysis is conducted to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed solution and to evaluate the achievable system
tradeoffs.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了通过有限块长度（FBL）传输在低空无线网络（LAWNs）中实现无人机对多台自动导引车（AGVs）的实时无线控制。采用模型预测控制（MPC）确保轨迹跟踪精度，并通过交替优化（AO）框架解决非凸优化问题。仿真和实验验证了其控制性能的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空无线网络（LAWNs）为物联网（IoT）系统中的实时控制应用提供了灵活平台，但无线传输的延迟和可靠性是关键挑战。

Method: 采用模型预测控制（MPC）和有限块长度（FBL）传输分析通信可靠性，提出交替优化（AO）框架，结合投影梯度下降（PGD）和连续凸近似（SCA）技术求解非凸优化问题。

Result: 仿真和实验表明，该方法在控制性能上优于基线方案。

Conclusion: 论文提出的联合优化框架在无人机对AGVs的实时无线控制中表现出色，为解决LAWNs中的非凸优化问题提供了高效方法。

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have been envisioned as flexible and
transformative platforms for enabling delay-sensitive control applications in
Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In this work, we investigate the real-time
wireless control over a LAWN system, where an aerial drone is employed to serve
multiple mobile automated guided vehicles (AGVs) via finite blocklength (FBL)
transmission. Toward this end, we adopt the model predictive control (MPC) to
ensure accurate trajectory tracking, while we analyze the communication
reliability using the outage probability. Subsequently, we formulate an
optimization problem to jointly determine control policy, transmit power
allocation, and drone trajectory by accounting for the maximum travel distance
and control input constraints. To address the resultant non-convex optimization
problem, we first derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability
under FBL transmission. Based on this, we reformulate the original problem as a
quadratic programming (QP) problem, followed by developing an alternating
optimization (AO) framework. Specifically, we employ the projected gradient
descent (PGD) method and the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to
achieve computationally efficient sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, we
thoroughly analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed
algorithm. Extensive simulations and AirSim-based experiments are conducted to
validate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to the baseline
schemes in terms of control performance.

### [7] [Parameter estimation of range-migrating targets using OTFS signals from LEO satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02385)
*Tong Ding,Luca Venturino,Emanuele Grossi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于LEO卫星OTFS调制的通信感知一体化系统，用于估计高速目标的参数，并通过稀疏信号结构和最大似然估计器实现参数估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用OTFS调制的信号处理特性，解决高速目标的参数估计问题，填补了现有研究中针对目标范围迁移的空白。

Method: 通过OTFS收发器的信号处理，建立了高速目标回波的输入输出模型，利用稀疏结构设计近似最大似然估计器，并结合块正交匹配追踪算法和匹配滤波器组进行参数估计。

Result: 研究发现目标响应在延迟-多普勒域具有稀疏结构，且范围迁移导致响应扩散。仿真结果表明该方法的估计性能有效。

Conclusion: 该方法通过OTFS信号处理解决了高速目标参数估计问题，为未来通信感知一体化系统的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study investigates a communication-centric integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system that utilizes orthogonal time frequency space
(OTFS) modulated signals emitted by low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to
estimate the parameters of space targets experiencing range migration,
henceforth referred to as high-speed targets. Leveraging the specific signal
processing performed by OTFS transceivers, we derive a novel input-output model
for the echo generated by a high-speed target in scenarios where ideal and
rectangular shaping filters are employed. Our findings reveal that the target
response exhibits a sparse structure in the delay-Doppler domain, dependent
solely upon the initial range and range-rate; notably, range migration causes a
spread in the target response, marking a significant departure from previous
studies. Utilizing this signal structure, we propose an approximate
implementation of the maximum likelihood estimator for the target's initial
range, range-rate, and amplitude. The estimation process involves obtaining
coarse information on the target response using a block orthogonal matching
pursuit algorithm, followed by a refinement step using a bank of matched
filters focused on a smaller range and range-rate region. Finally, numerical
examples are provided to evaluate the estimation performance.

### [8] [When Attention is Beneficial for Learning Wireless Resource Allocation Efficiently?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02427)
*Jia Guo,Chenyang Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Transformer和GNN结合用于无线资源分配是否必要？研究表明，无干扰时无需注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨注意力机制在资源分配中的必要性，特别是针对无线策略的置换属性。

Method: 通过分析集合上的函数结构和数值算法，提出一种结合GNN和注意力机制的框架。

Result: 发现无干扰时无需注意力机制，并通过仿真验证了所提出GNN的学习效率。

Conclusion: 注意力机制在无线资源分配中的作用取决于干扰的存在与否，为GNN设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Owing to the use of attention mechanism to leverage the dependency across
tokens, Transformers are efficient for natural language processing. By
harnessing permutation properties broadly exist in resource allocation
policies, each mapping measurable environmental parameters (e.g., channel
matrix) to optimized variables (e.g., precoding matrix), graph neural networks
(GNNs) are promising for learning these policies efficiently in terms of
scalability and generalizability. To reap the benefits of both architectures,
there is a recent trend of incorporating attention mechanism with GNNs for
learning wireless policies. Nevertheless, is the attention mechanism really
needed for resource allocation? In this paper, we strive to answer this
question by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical
algorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are
induced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the
permutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed
by two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not. We
proceed to re-express the numerical algorithms for optimizing several
representative resource allocation problems in recursive forms. We find that
when interference (say multi-user or inter-data stream interference) is not
reflected in the measurable parameters of a policy, attention needs to be used
to model the interference. With the insight, we establish a framework of
designing GNNs by aligning with the structures. By taking reconfigurable
intelligent surface-aided hybrid precoding as an example, the learning
efficiency of the proposed GNN is validated via simulations.

*C. S. Ramalingam*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文纠正了Rabiner和Lyons关于频率采样滤波器（FSF）设计中过渡系数和峰值旁瓣水平（PSL）的错误数据，并提供了我们程序计算的最优值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Rabiner和Lyons发表的数据不一致且存在错误，本文旨在提供准确的过渡系数和PSL值。

Method: 通过程序计算，重新估计了低通和带通滤波器的最优过渡系数和PSL值。

Result: 发现并纠正了Rabiner和Lyons发表的数据错误，提供了新的最优值。

Conclusion: 本文为FSF设计提供了更准确的数据，纠正了文献中的错误。

Abstract: Tables of optimal transition coefficients and peak sidelobe level (PSL, in
dB) associated with frequency sampling filter (FSF) design were published by
Rabiner et al. (Jun 1970), and reproduced, for example, in the book Digital
Signal Processing by Proakis and Manolakis (4/e, 2007). A set of values are
also given in Appendix H of Understanding Digital Signal Processing} by Lyons
(3/e, 2011), but there are significant differences between these two sets. For
example, for $N=16$ and BW$=4$, two different transition coefficient values
have been reported, viz., $0.38916626$ (Rabiner, et al.) and $0.34918551$
(Lyons). Neither is optimal, for we find the optimum value to be $0.40474097$.
The published values of the corresponding PSLs were also found to be incorrect.
In this paper we give the optimal values of the transition coefficients and PSL
values as estimated by our program for the lowpass and bandpass filters listed
in Rabiner et al. and Lyons.

*Shuaixin Yang,Yijia Li,Yue Xiao,Yong Liang Guan,Xianfu Lei,Zhiguo Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的PA-IM方案，通过夹持天线位置模式提升频谱效率，优化收发器设计并降低检测复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不增加硬件复杂度的前提下提高频谱效率。

Method: 结合通道模型、低复杂度BOSD算法、BER上限分析和预编码优化。

Result: 性能显著优于传统方案，BER大幅改善。

Conclusion: PA-IM方案高效且性能优越。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel pinching-antenna assisted index modulation (PA-IM)
scheme is proposed for improving the spectral efficiency without increasing the
hardware complexity, where the information bits are conveyed not only by the
conventional M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols but also by
the indices of pinching antenna (PA) position patterns. To realize the full
potential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver
design, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and
performance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel
model is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the
deterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of
wireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading.
Next, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML)
detection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is
designed, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML
performance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER)
is derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding
method is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by
jointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the
waveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all
received signal points. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed PA-IM scheme attains a significant performance gain over its
conventional counterparts and that the overall BER of the pinching-antenna
system is substantially improved by the proposed precoding design.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种交替残差误差消除（AREE）算法，用于解耦混合波束成形中的模拟和数字预编码器，从而提高计算和频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合波束成形在毫米波通信中被广泛应用，但模拟和数字预编码器的耦合限制了算法的效率和性能。

Method: 通过将问题分解为两个低维子问题，迭代消除残差误差，并结合几何信道SVD简化计算。

Result: 仿真表明，AREE算法能有效解耦预编码器，快速收敛，且频谱效率高于现有方法。

Conclusion: AREE算法为混合波束成形提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Hybrid beamforming has been widely employed in mmWave communications such as
vehicular-to-everything (V2X) scenarios, as a compromise between hardware
complexity and spectral efficiency. However, the inherent coupling between
analog and digital precoders in hybrid array architecture significantly limits
the computational and spectral efficiency of existing algorithms. To address
this issue, we propose an alternating residual error elimination (AREE)
algorithm, which decomposes the hybrid beamforming problem into two
low-dimensional subproblems, each exhibiting a favorable matrix structure that
enables effective decoupling of analog and digital precoders from the matrix
product formulation. These subproblems iteratively eliminate each other's
residual errors, driving the original problem toward the optimal hybrid
beamforming performance. The proposed initialization ensures rapid convergence,
while a low-complexity geometric channel SVD algorithm is developed by
transforming the high-dimensional sparse channel into a low-dimensional
equivalent, thereby simplifying the derivation of subproblems. Simulation
results demonstrate that the AREE algorithm effectively decouples analog and
digital precoders with low complexity, achieves fast convergence, and offers
higher spectral efficiency than existing beamforming methods.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了毫米波MIMO系统中的预编码设计，采用RIS增强传输并通过DNN优化码字选择以减少计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的ES方法在连续相位偏移中寻找最优码字计算量大且耗时，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 提出使用DFT向量设计码本，并开发DNN模型加速码字选择。

Result: 仿真显示DNN在测试阶段能保持次优频谱效率，适应RIS与终端用户距离变化。

Conclusion: DNN在RIS辅助系统中具有潜在优势，能够显著提升效率。

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

### [13] [Matrix Pencil-Based DoA Estimation for Hybrid Receivers in Snapshot-Limited Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02132)
*Mona Mostafa,Ramy H. Gohary,Amr El-Keyi,Yahia A. Eldemerdash Ahmed*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出两种方法，利用矩阵铅笔方法（MPM）在混合模拟/数字（HAD）接收器中估计小样本下的到达方向（DoAs），通过循环模拟组合器避免低维投影的衰减问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在小样本情况下，传统统计平均不可靠，而MPM方法因模拟组合器的纠缠无法直接应用于HAD接收器，需要新方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）适用于全连接和部分连接HAD，依赖周期性信号解纠缠；2）仅适用于部分连接HAD，利用块对角结构消除对周期性信号的依赖。

Result: 数值模拟显示，所提方法优于克拉美-罗下界，能有效提取DoAs。

Conclusion: 两种方法成功克服了HAD接收器中的低维投影问题，为小样本DoA估计提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to estimate the directions of arrival (DoAs) for
hybrid analog/digital (HAD) receivers when the number of snapshots is too small
for statistical averaging to be reliable. This goal is achieved in
fully-digital receivers by employing the matrix pencil method (MPM).
Unfortunately, the MPM cannot be directly applied in HAD receivers because of
the entanglement induced by the underlying analog combiners on the output
signals. Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a
low-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from
particular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two
approaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two
approaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by
cycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the
entire space. The first approach can be applied to both fully-connected (FC)
and partially-connected (PC) HADs and relies on the availability of periodic,
potentially unknown, signals to disentangle the output of the HAD receiver. The
second approach applies to PC-HADs only, and eliminates contingency on periodic
signals by exploiting the underlying block diagonal structure. The superiority
of the proposed approaches is demonstrated via numerical simulations and
comparisons with the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound.

Conclusion: LLM优化器框架不仅具有理论支持，且在多LLM架构下也能显著提升收敛速度。

Abstract: Future wireless networks are expected to incorporate diverse services that
often lack general mathematical models. To address such black-box network
management tasks, the large language model (LLM) optimizer framework, which
leverages pretrained LLMs as optimization agents, has recently been promoted as
a promising solution. This framework utilizes natural language prompts
describing the given optimization problems along with past solutions generated
by LLMs themselves. As a result, LLMs can obtain efficient solutions
autonomously without knowing the mathematical models of the objective
functions. Although the viability of the LLM optimizer (LLMO) framework has
been studied in various black-box scenarios, it has so far been limited to
numerical simulations. For the first time, this paper establishes a theoretical
foundation for the LLMO framework. With careful investigations of LLM inference
steps, we can interpret the LLMO procedure as a finite-state Markov chain, and
prove the convergence of the framework. Our results are extended to a more
advanced multiple LLM architecture, where the impact of multiple LLMs is
rigorously verified in terms of the convergence rate. Comprehensive numerical
simulations validate our theoretical results and provide a deeper understanding
of the underlying mechanisms of the LLMO framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来蜂窝系统中的ISAC技术尚未在SHM中充分发挥潜力，尤其是面对多径干扰和超高精度要求的挑战。

Method: 利用RIS作为参考点与基站和用户协作，动态调整RIS相位以抑制多径干扰，并通过Fisher信息理论和贝叶斯推断模型优化测量精度和损伤检测概率。

Result: 理论分析和数值模拟证实，ISAC能够实现毫米级变形检测，满足SHM的高精度需求。

Conclusion: 研究表明，ISAC结合RIS技术是SHM的高效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of future
cellular systems, enabling applications such as intruder detection, monitoring,
and tracking using the same infrastructure. However, its potential for
structural health monitoring (SHM), which requires the detection of slow and
subtle structural changes, remains largely unexplored due to challenges such as
multipath interference and the need for ultra-high sensing precision. This
study introduces a novel theoretical framework for SHM via ISAC by leveraging
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as reference points in collaboration
with base stations and users. By dynamically adjusting RIS phases to generate
distinct radio signals that suppress background multipath interference,
measurement accuracy at these reference points is enhanced. We theoretically
analyze RIS-aided collaborative sensing in three-dimensional cellular networks
using Fisher information theory, demonstrating how increasing observation time,
incorporating additional receivers (even with self-positioning errors),
optimizing RIS phases, and refining collaborative node selection can reduce the
position error bound to meet SHM's stringent accuracy requirements.
Furthermore, we develop a Bayesian inference model to identify structural
states and validate damage detection probabilities. Both theoretical and
numerical analyses confirm ISAC's capability for millimeter-level deformation
detection, highlighting its potential for high-precision SHM applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于THz等离子体通信的二元场驱动元路由方法，利用石墨烯的电磁特性实现动态调控，支持芯片级系统的高性能通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有线互连存在高电阻和延迟问题，而毫米波无线解决方案又面临带宽拥堵和干扰问题，需要开发新型高效芯片级互连技术。

Method: 采用半解析框架建模THz等离子体与石墨烯电磁特性的可调相互作用，并设计了四种元像素天线配置，实现动态耦合和路由。

Result: 理论与全波模拟结果高度一致，验证了该方法在低延迟、高性能THz通信中的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为空间受限的高速互连应用提供了潜在解决方案，特别适用于WiNoC和小芯片应用。

Abstract: Efficient chip-scale interconnects are essential for modern
microelectronic-photonic systems, supporting high bandwidth and low-latency
processing. Traditional wired links face high resistivity and latency, while
millimeter-wave wireless solutions suffer from bandwidth congestion and
interference. Terahertz (THz) plasmonic communication, based on surface plasmon
polaritons (SPPs), offers high data rates and broad bandwidth, and is
compatible with nanophotonic platforms. This work introduces a Binary
Field-Driven Meta-Routing Method supported by a semi-analytical framework that
models the tunable interaction between THz plasmonic phenomena and graphene's
electromagnetic properties. By modulating graphene's impedance, the method
enables dynamic coupling and routing of localized surface plasmon resonances
(LSPRs) across a meta-network, facilitating real-time beam steering in
chip-scale systems. Combining analytical conductivity models, coupled-mode
theory, and algorithmic control, the approach enables predictive configuration
of LSPR-based steering in reconfigurable graphene metasurfaces. Four meta-pixel
antenna configurations Y-MetaRouter, MetaSwitcher, Penta-MetaEmitter, and
CP-MetaCore are designed to support unidirectional radiation, bi-directional
steering, frequency-driven transitions, and circular polarization,
respectively. Chemical potential modulation creates reconfigurable LSPR
pathways and virtual SPP channels. A Coupled-Mode Theory for Field-Driven LSPR
Meta-Networks is proposed to model current distributions and predict far-field
characteristics. Results show strong agreement between theory and full-wave
simulations. A point-to-point meta-wireless link is analyzed, demonstrating
scalability for low-latency, high-performance THz communication in WiNoC and
chiplet applications. System-level metrics confirm feasibility for
space-constrained, high-speed interconnects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应ISTA算法作为解决LASSO问题的实用算法，缺乏理论支持，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用中位数绝对偏差估计噪声水平的阈值策略，分析算法的固定点性质和收敛性。

Result: 证明了算法的尺度等变性、非唯一性、局部稳定性，以及局部线性收敛和全局收敛。

Conclusion: 自适应ISTA算法在理论和实践上均具有重要价值，为LASSO问题提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular
algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without
explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the
adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results
exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA
with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute
deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including
scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear
convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的后期协作框架，用于3D多源多目标融合，仅需共享3D边界框属性，无需访问检测模型，显著降低了位置、尺度和方向误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有协作感知方法对高通信带宽和模型架构访问的依赖问题，以适用于实际自动驾驶场景。

Method: 基于3D边界框属性（类别、大小、位置和方向）的后期协作框架，避免直接访问检测模型。

Result: 将位置误差降低至现有方法的五分之一，尺度误差减少7.5倍，方向误差减半，同时保持100%的精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 该框架为高效、可扩展的多智能体融合设定了新标准，有效应对实际协作感知挑战。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: 论文提出了限制拟凸等距性质（RQIP）的推广，针对α稳定随机投影，推导了其成立的矩阵行数下限，并结合实证分数矩的集中不等式和稀疏ℓα球的覆盖数界，得出了样本复杂度结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决限制等距性质（RIP）在实际稀疏恢复问题中可能存在的不足，研究提出了RQIP作为替代框架，以适应α稳定随机投影的特性。

Method: 通过推导对称α稳定（SαS）分布随机矩阵的RQIP行数下限，结合实证分数矩的集中不等式和稀疏ℓα球的覆盖数界，完成了理论分析。

Result: 得出了RQIP成立的样本复杂度，揭示了多项式尾行为的集中性，并验证了稀疏恢复可能需要替代框架（如零空间性质）的观察。

Conclusion: 研究支持了RIP框架在实际应用中可能需要被其他稀疏恢复方法替代的结论，尤其是针对α稳定随机投影的场景。

Abstract: We formulate a generalization of the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)
referred to as the Restricted Quasiconvexity Isometry Property (RQIP) for alpha
stable random projections with $0<\alpha<1$. A lower bound on the number of
rows for RQIP to hold for random matrices whose entries are drawn from a
symmetric $\alpha$-stable ($S\alpha S$) distribution is derived. The proof
leverages two key components: a concentration inequality for empirical
fractional moments of $S\alpha S$ variables and a covering number bound for
sparse $\ell_\alpha$ balls. The resulting sample complexity reflects the
polynomial tail behavior of the concentration and reinforces an observation
made in the literature that the RIP framework may have to be replaced with
other sparse recovery formulations in practice, such as those based on the null
space property.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于多端口网络理论的RIS无线信道模型在参数未知时无法直接应用，论文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 结合闭式解和梯度下降步骤，适用于多比特可编程RIS元素，并讨论了参数歧义问题。

Result: 在未知的富散射环境中实验验证了技术有效性，发现模型精度差异虽大但端到端性能差异小。

Conclusion: 提出的技术能有效估计未知RIS参数，但模型精度差异对实际性能影响有限。

Abstract: Physics-consistent theoretical studies on RIS-parametrized wireless channels
use models from multiport-network theory (MNT) to capture mutual-coupling (MC)
effects. However, in practice, RIS design and radio environment are partially
or completely unknown. We fill a research gap on how to estimate the MNT model
parameters in such experimentally relevant scenarios. Our technique efficiently
combines closed-form and gradient-descent steps, and it can be applied to
multi-bit-programmable RIS elements. We discuss inevitable (but operationally
irrelevant) parameter ambiguities. We experimentally validate our technique in
an unknown rich-scattering environment parametrized by eight 8-bit-programmable
RIS elements of unknown design. We experimentally evaluate the performance of
RIS configurations optimized with the estimated MNT model and an MC-unaware
cascaded model. While the models differ in accuracy by up to 17 dB, the
end-to-end performance differences are small.

Motivation: 车联网的实时数据传输和处理面临动态无线信道条件的挑战，需提高传输准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升车联网的数据传输效率和服务质量，适应动态场景。

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) transforms the transportation ecosystem
promising pervasive connectivity and data-driven approaches. Deep learning and
generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly
enhance the operation of applications within IoV by facilitating efficient
decision-making and predictive capabilities, including intelligent navigation,
vehicle safety monitoring, accident prevention, and intelligent traffic
management. Nevertheless, efficiently transmitting and processing the massive
volumes of data generated by the IoV in real-time remains a significant
challenge, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable wireless channel
conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a semantic
communication framework based on channel perception to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of data transmission. The semantic communication model extracts and
compresses the information to be transmitted. In addition, the wireless channel
is estimated by using a generative diffusion model, which is employed to
predict the dynamic channel states, thereby improving the quality of IoV
service. In dynamic scenarios, however, the channel estimation performance may
be degraded when substantially new scenarios take place, which will adversely
affect user experience. To mitigate this limitation, we employ a large model to
fine-tune the channel generation model to enhance its adaptability for varying
scenarios. The performance and reliability of the proposed framework are
evaluated on the two public datasets.

Conclusion: 该研究成功实现了基于5G PRS信号的多站ISAC高保真目标检测、定位与跟踪。

Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference
Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits
a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers
exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and
tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a
range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are
extracted for every target. For a single target, the resulting bistatic delays
are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric
position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed
equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are
obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account
for time synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving
target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to
standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results
show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G
PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.
