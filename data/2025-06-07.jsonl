The proposed design considers a\npractical mean squared error (MSE) constraint between the desired and the\nachieved beampatterns constructed for identifying radar targets (RTs). To\nachieve optimal performance, we formulate an optimization problem relying on\nsum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization of the communication users (CUs),\nwhile satisfying certain radar beampattern similarity (RBPS), total transmit\npower, and constant modulus constraints, where the latter are attributed to the\nhybrid mmWave MIMO architecture. Since the aforementioned problem is non-convex\nand intractable, a sequential approach is proposed wherein the TPCs are\ndesigned first, followed by the RCs. To deal with the non-convex MSE and\nconstant modulus constraints in the TPC design problem, we propose a\nmajorization and minimization (MM) based Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG)\nmethod, which restricts the tolerable MSE of the beampattern to within a\npredefined limit. Moreover, the least squares and the zero-forcing methods are\nadopted for maximizing the sum-SE and for mitigating the multiuser interference\n(MUI), respectively. Furthermore, to design the RC at each CU, we propose a\nlinear MM-based blind combiner (LMBC) scheme that does not rely on the\nknowledge of the TPC at the CUs and has a low complexity. To achieve user\nfairness, we further extend the proposed sequential approach for maximizing the\ngeometric mean (GM) of the CU's rate. Simulation results are presented, which\nshow the superior performance of the proposed hybrid TPC and RC in comparison\nto the state-of-the-art designs in the mmWave MIMO ISAC systems under\nconsideration."}
