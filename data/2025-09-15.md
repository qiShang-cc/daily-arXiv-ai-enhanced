TL;DR: 研究利用机器学习竞赛平台开发新生儿脑电图背景模式分类模型，发现深度学习模型在验证集上表现更好，但所有模型在未见数据上泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过机器学习提升新生儿脑功能监测的专家表现，解决高质量标注数据不足的问题。

Method: 构建包含353小时脑电图的多中心回顾性数据集，举办机器学习竞赛，评估前4名模型在独立验证集上的表现。

Result: 特征模型在测试集上表现最佳，但深度学习模型在验证集上泛化更好；所有模型在验证集上性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 训练模型需大规模多样化数据以保证泛化，开放数据和协作式机器学习开发能加速临床决策工具的发展。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to support and improve expert
performance in monitoring the brain function of at-risk newborns. Developing
accurate and reliable ML models depends on access to high-quality, annotated
data, a resource in short supply. ML competitions address this need by
providing researchers access to expertly annotated datasets, fostering shared
learning through direct model comparisons, and leveraging the benefits of
crowdsourcing diverse expertise. We compiled a retrospective dataset containing
353 hours of EEG from 102 individual newborns from a multi-centre study. The
data was fully anonymised and divided into training, testing, and held-out
validation datasets. EEGs were graded for the severity of abnormal background
patterns. Next, we created a web-based competition platform and hosted a
machine learning competition to develop ML models for classifying the severity
of EEG background patterns in newborns. After the competition closed, the top 4
performing models were evaluated offline on a separate held-out validation
dataset. Although a feature-based model ranked first on the testing dataset,
deep learning models generalised better on the validation sets. All methods had
a significant decline in validation performance compared to the testing
performance. This highlights the challenges for model generalisation on unseen
data, emphasising the need for held-out validation datasets in ML studies with
neonatal EEG. The study underscores the importance of training ML models on
large and diverse datasets to ensure robust generalisation. The competition's
outcome demonstrates the potential for open-access data and collaborative ML
development to foster a collaborative research environment and expedite the
development of clinical decision-support tools for neonatal neuromonitoring.

### [2] [Locally Permuted Low Rank Column-wise Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09820)
*Ahmed Ali Abbasi,Namrata Vaswani*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了解决低秩列感知（LRCS）问题的新方法，特别针对数据被扰乱或排列的情况，称为排列LRCS。通过改进的交替梯度下降与最小化（AltGDMin）算法和交替最小化（AltMin）算法，实验证明前者收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究排列LRCS问题，结合了无标记感知和低秩列感知的两个前沿领域，旨在解决部分数据被扰乱时的感知问题。

Method: 提出改进的AltGDMin算法和AltMin算法，分别用于解决排列LRCS问题。

Result: 仿真实验表明，两种算法均能收敛，但AltGDMin的收敛速度显著快于AltMin。

Conclusion: 排列LRCS问题可通过改进的AltGDMin高效解决，该方法在速度和效果上优于传统交替最小化算法。

Abstract: We precisely formulate, and provide a solution for, the Low Rank Columnwise
Sensing (LRCS) problem when some of the observed data is
scrambled/permuted/unlabeled. This problem, which we refer to as permuted LRCS,
lies at the intersection of two distinct topics of recent research: unlabeled
sensing and low rank column-wise (matrix) sensing. We introduce a novel
generalization of the recently developed Alternating Gradient Descent and
Minimization (AltGDMin) algorithm to solve this problem. We also develop an
alternating minimization (AltMin) solution. We show, using simulation
experiments, that both converge but PermutedAltGDmin is much faster than
Permuted-AltMin.

### [3] [Real-Time Remote Tracking with State-Dependent Detection Probability: A POMDP Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09837)
*Jiapei Tian,Abolfazl Zakeri,Marian Codreanu,David Gundlegård*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了一种由两个异构传感器监控的实时跟踪系统，通过优化传感器调度和数据传输策略，使用POMDP模型解决传感失败和丢包的不确定性，最终展示所提策略优于基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构传感器在传感失败和传输丢包情况下的最优调度问题，以最小化失真和传输成本。

Method: 采用POMDP模型并将其转化为belief-MDP，通过网格离散化和RVIA算法求解有限状态MDP。

Result: 仿真结果显示所提策略显著优于基准方法，验证了考虑状态依赖传感可靠性的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过优化传感器调度策略，系统性能得到显著提升，为类似实时跟踪系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider a real-time tracking system where a binary Markov source is
monitored by two heterogeneous sensors. Upon command, sensors send their
observations to a remote sink over error-prone channels. We assume each sensor
exhibits state-dependent detection accuracy and may occasionally fail to detect
the source state. At most one sensor is scheduled for sampling at each time
slot. We assess the effectiveness of data communication using a generic
distortion function that captures the end application's objective. We derive
optimal sink-side command policies to minimize the weighted sum of distortion
and transmission costs. To model the uncertainty introduced by sensing failures
(of the sensors) and packet loss, we formulate the problem as a partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which we then cast into a
belief-MDP. Since the belief evolves continuously, the belief space is
discretized into a finite grid and the belief value is quantized to the nearest
grid point after each update. This formulation leads to a finite-state MDP
problem, which is solved using the relative value iteration algorithm (RVIA).
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed policy significantly
outperforms benchmark strategies and highlights the importance of accounting
for state-dependent sensing reliability in sensor scheduling.

TL;DR: 研究通过头带设备测量足球头球时的头部运动学数据，并与口腔传感器数据对比，结果显示两者在部分运动学数据上具有较好一致性，未来需改进头带设备的全面性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究足球头球动作与轻度创伤性脑损伤（mTBI）风险的关系，需要通过可靠的设备测量头部运动学数据。

Method: 利用头带设备在典型足球头球场景（掷界外球、球门球、角球）下测量头部运动学，并与口腔传感器的测量数据对比。

Result: 头带与口腔传感器的时间历史数据一致性从“一般”到“优秀”，角速度和线加速度的一致性最高（0.79±0.08和0.73±0.05），角加速度最低（0.67±0.06）。峰值运动学数据存在一定偏差。

Conclusion: 头带设备在部分运动学测量中表现合理，未来需提升其全面性能。

Abstract: Purpose: To study the relationship between soccer heading and the risk of
mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), we previously developed an instrumented
headband and data processing scheme to measure the angular head kinematics of
soccer headers. Laboratory evaluation of the headband on an anthropomorphic
test device showed good agreement with a reference sensor for soccer ball
impacts to the front of the head. In this study, we evaluate the headband in
measuring the full head kinematics of soccer headers in the field. Methods: The
headband was evaluated under typical soccer heading scenarios (throw-ins,
goal-kicks, and corner-kicks) on a human subject. The measured time history and
peak kinematics from the headband were compared with those from an instrumented
mouthpiece, which is a widely accepted method for measuring head kinematics in
the field. Results: The time history agreement (CORA scores) between the
headband and the mouthpiece ranged from 'fair' to 'excellent', with the highest
agreement for angular velocities (0.79 \pm 0.08) and translational
accelerations (0.73 \pm 0.05) and lowest for angular accelerations (0.67 \pm
0.06). A Bland-Altman analysis of the peak kinematics from the headband and
mouthpiece found the mean bias to be 40.9% (of the maximum mouthpiece reading)
for the angular velocity, 16.6% for the translational acceleration, and-14.1%
for the angular acceleration. Conclusion: The field evaluation of the
instrumented headband showed reasonable agreement with the mouthpiece for some
kinematic measures and impact conditions. Future work should focus on improving
the headband performance across all kinematic measures.

### [6] [Uplink RSMA for Pinching-Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10076)
*Apostolos A. Tegos,Yue Xiao,Sotiris A. Tegos,George K. Karagiannidis,Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了pinching天线系统（PAS）用于室内通信，通过减少发射器和接收器之间的距离，并采用速率分割多址接入（RSMA）方案，提高了系统的性能和可靠性，优于传统的NOMA方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足下一代无线网络对高可靠性和高容量通信的需求，需要克服传统技术的限制，如固定天线位置对信号路径损耗的影响。

Method: 研究了一种两用户、两pinching天线上行链路PAS，采用速率分割技术构建比传统非正交多址接入（NOMA）更稳健的框架。

Result: 推导了新的中断概率闭式表达式，并通过数值结果验证了RSMA方案优于NOMA PAS。

Conclusion: PAS结合RSMA方案能够有效提升系统性能，为室内通信提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: One of the key goals of next-generation wireless networks is to adapt to
changing conditions and meet the growing demand for reliable, high-capacity
communications from emerging applications. Overcoming the limitations of
conventional technologies, such as fixed antenna positions, is essential to
achieving this objective because it mitigates the impact of path loss on the
received signal and creates strong line-of-sight links, enhancing system
performance. With this in mind, the newly proposed pinching antenna systems
(PASs) are a promising solution for indoor applications because they can
activate antennas across a waveguide deployed in a room, thus reducing the
distance between the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we investigate a
two-user, two-pinching-antenna uplink PAS, in which the transmitters use rate
splitting to create a more resilient framework than non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA). For this network, we derive novel closed-form expressions for
the outage probability. Numerical results validate these expressions, proving
that the proposed rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme outperforms NOMA
PAS.

### [7] [FetalSleepNet: A Transfer Learning Framework with Spectral Equalisation Domain Adaptation for Fetal Sleep Stage Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10082)
*Weitao Tang,Johann Vargas-Calixto,Nasim Katebi,Nhi Tran,Sharmony B. Kelly,Gari D. Clifford,Robert Galinsky,Faezeh Marzbanrad*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了首个深度学习模型FetalSleepNet，用于从胎儿羊皮脑电图(EEG)中分类睡眠状态，通过迁移学习和域适应策略提升性能，并具有应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决胎儿EEG数据获取和解释的困难，并通过准确分类睡眠状态，早期检测与妊娠并发症相关的脑发育异常。

Method: 采用轻量级深度神经网络，通过迁移学习和光谱均衡化策略，减少域间差异，优化模型性能。

Result: 结果表明，完全微调结合光谱均衡化策略表现最佳（准确率86.6%，宏观F1分数62.5），超越基线模型。

Conclusion: FetalSleepNet是首个专为胎儿EEG睡眠分类设计的深度学习框架，其轻量设计适合低功耗实时系统，并可扩展到临床其他信号处理。

Abstract: Introduction: This study presents FetalSleepNet, the first published deep
learning approach to classifying sleep states from the ovine
electroencephalogram (EEG). Fetal EEG is complex to acquire and difficult and
laborious to interpret consistently. However, accurate sleep stage
classification may aid in the early detection of abnormal brain maturation
associated with pregnancy complications (e.g. hypoxia or intrauterine growth
restriction).
  Methods: EEG electrodes were secured onto the ovine dura over the parietal
cortices of 24 late gestation fetal sheep. A lightweight deep neural network
originally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG
using transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain
adaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.
  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full
fine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall
performance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming
baseline models.
  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep
learning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the
fetal EEG. Beyond the laboratory, the EEG-based sleep stage classifier
functions as a label engine, enabling large scale weak/semi supervised labeling
and distillation to facilitate training on less invasive signals that can be
acquired in the clinic, such as Doppler Ultrasound or electrocardiogram data.
FetalSleepNet's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment in low
power, real time, and wearable fetal monitoring systems.

### [8] [Resilient Vital Sign Monitoring Using RIS-Assisted Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10088)
*Christian Eckrich,Abdelhak M. Zoubir,Vahid Jamali*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用可重构智能表面（RIS）增强雷达传感的呼吸监测方法，以解决传统单一路径雷达在不良方向下监测不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于可穿戴设备在不舒适或用户不配合的情况下（如居家老年护理）往往无法持续监测生命体征，因此非接触式解决方案（如雷达传感）受到关注。传统单一路径雷达在某些方向下监测呼吸运动不可靠，需要改进方法。

Method: 提出了一种新型多路径生命体征传感模型，结合直接雷达路径和RIS反射路径，以提高呼吸监测的鲁棒性。

Result: 研究表明，该方法能够通过RIS提供额外的传感路径，显著提升呼吸监测的可靠性，尤其是在受试者方向不利的情况下。

Conclusion: 集成RIS的多路径传感模型为连续、隐私保护的生命体征监测提供了潜在优势和性能改进。

Abstract: Vital sign monitoring plays a critical role in healthcare and well-being, as
parameters such as respiration and heart rate offer valuable insights into an
individual's physiological state. While wearable devices allow for continuous
measurement, their use in settings like in-home elderly care is often hindered
by discomfort or user noncompliance. As a result, contactless solutions based
on radar sensing have garnered increasing attention. This is due to their
unobtrusive design and preservation of privacy advantages compared to
camera-based systems. However, a single radar perspective can fail to capture
breathing-induced chest movements reliably, particularly when the subject's
orientation is unfavorable. To address this limitation, we integrate a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that provides an additional sensing
path, thereby enhancing the robustness of respiratory monitoring. We present a
novel model for multi-path vital sign sensing that leverages both the direct
radar path and an RIS-reflected path. We further discuss the potential benefits
and improved performance our approach offers in continuous, privacy-preserving
vital sign monitoring.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图信号变化度量的方法，用于在线识别疫情传播中的关键区域，通过模拟和真实数据验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球疫情的扩散与人口流动密切相关，需及时识别加速传播的关键区域以实施隔离措施。

Method: 将感染建模为时间演化的图信号，结合图域和时间域局部性，提出图信号变化度量，并开发在线算法识别关键区域。

Result: 模拟和真实数据（H1N1和印度COVID-19数据）表明，该方法能有效识别传播能力强的区域，隔离这些区域可显著减少累计感染。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有助于更深入理解和控制疫情传播，为公共卫生决策提供支持。

Abstract: The global spread of pandemics is facilitated by the mobility of populations,
transforming localized infections into widespread phenomena. To contain it,
timely identification of influential regions that accelerate this process is
necessary. In this work, we model infection as a temporally evolving graph
signal and propose graph signal variation-based metrics to capture
spatio-temporal changes. Both graph domain and time domain locality are
modeled. Based on this metric, we propose an online algorithm to identify
influential regions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively identifies geographical regions with a higher capacity to spread
the infection. Isolating these regions leads to a significant reduction in
cumulative infection. Simulations, along with analyses of hybrid H1N1 data and
real-world Indian COVID-19 data, underscore the utility of proposed metric in
enhancing our understanding and control of infection spread

### [10] [Low-Complexity Null-Space-Based Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10296)
*Cheng Luo,Jie Hu,Luping Xiang,Kun Yang,Zhiqin Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在非线性能量收集模型下，多用户SWIPT中专用能量波束的必要性，并提出了一种低复杂度算法以减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在多用户SWIPT系统中，专用能量波束（EBs）是否必要，以及如何优化设计以实现高效能的无线信息和能量传输。

Method: 提出了一种基于零空间的传输方案，并通过优化问题设计和低复杂度算法验证了EB的作用。

Result: 结果显示，在特定条件下，专用EBs可以提高效率，且提出的算法显著降低了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 在非线性EH模型中，信息波束通常足以支持WET和WIT，但在特定波形下，专用EBs能提升性能；提出的算法高效且性能损失可忽略。

Abstract: Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has attracted
sustained interest. We propose a null-space-based transmission scheme for
multiuser SWIPT serving both energy users (EUs) and information users (IUs).
Under a practical nonlinear energy-harvesting (EH) model and multiple waveform
options, we revisit the role of dedicated energy beams (EBs). We show that, in
general, dedicated EBs are unnecessary because information beams (IBs) with
Gaussian signaling can simultaneously support wireless energy transfer (WET)
and wireless information transfer (WIT), unless special energy-centric
waveforms (e.g., deterministic sinusoidal waveforms) are employed and provide
sufficient gains. Guided by these insights, we formulate an optimization
problem for EB design to enable dedicated waveform transmission for WET, and we
develop a low-complexity algorithm that reduces computation by ignoring the WET
contribution of IBs during optimization. Numerical results corroborate that
deterministic sinusoidal waveforms outperform Gaussian signaling when the
received RF power lies in the EH high-efficiency region, making dedicated EBs
beneficial. The proposed scheme achieves computational complexity reductions of
91.43\% and 98.54\% for the cases $M=8,,K^I=K^E=2$ and $M=16,,K^I=K^E=4$,
respectively, with negligible performance loss, thereby validating the
efficiency of the low-complexity algorithm.

Abstract: The transition to 6G has driven significant updates to the 3GPP channel
model, particularly in modeling UE antennas and user-induced blockage for
handheld devices. The 3GPP Rel.19 revision of TR 38.901 introduces a more
realistic framework that captures directive antenna patterns, practical antenna
placements, polarization effects, and element-specific blockage. These updates
are based on high-fidelity simulations and measurements of a reference

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代蜂窝网络中，基于射频信号的定位在视线遮挡和多路径传播环境中具有潜力，但现有方法在复杂场景下的表现仍有提升空间。

Method: 扩展的MP-SLAM方法引入GMF库，结合PHD滤波器处理高质量历史地图特征，提升了定位鲁棒性。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在密集城市环境中优于传统方法，定位准确性高且适应性强，适用于5G/6G网络。

Conclusion: GMF增强的MP-SLAM为复杂环境中的定位提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) signal-based localization using modern cellular networks
has emerged as a promising solution to accurately locate objects in challenging
environments. One of the most promising solutions for situations involving
obstructed-line-of-sight (OLoS) and multipath propagation is multipathbased
simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) that employs map features
(MFs), such as virtual anchors. This paper presents an extended MP-SLAM method
that is augmented with a global map feature (GMF) repository. This repository
stores consistent MFs of high quality that are collected during prior
traversals. We integrate these GMFs back into the MP-SLAM framework via a
probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, which propagates GMF intensity
functions over time. Extensive simulations, together with a challenging
real-world experiment using LTE RF signals in a dense urban scenario with
severe multipath propagation and inter-cell interference, demonstrate that our
framework achieves robust and accurate localization, thereby showcasing its
effectiveness in realistic modern cellular networks such as 5G or future 6G
networks. It outperforms conventional proprioceptive sensor-based localization
and conventional MP-SLAM methods, and achieves reliable localization even under
adverse signal conditions.

TL;DR: 利用人类玩耍视频训练人形机器人通过上下文学习（ICL）进行高效的新任务操纵，提出MimicDroid方法，并在仿真和现实场景中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过扩展ICL训练数据源（人类玩耍视频）以解决传统依赖人工遥控数据的可扩展性问题，并提升机器人对新任务和环境的学习适应性。

Method: MimicDroid从视频中提取行为相似的轨迹对，训练策略预测动作；通过运动学相似性映射人类手腕姿势到机器人，并引入随机掩码以减少过拟合并增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在仿真和现实测试中，MimicDroid性能优于现有方法，现实成功率提高近一倍。

Conclusion: 人类玩耍视频是高效训练ICL的可行数据源，MimicDroid为机器人适应新任务提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We aim to enable humanoid robots to efficiently solve new manipulation tasks
from a few video examples. In-context learning (ICL) is a promising framework
for achieving this goal due to its test-time data efficiency and rapid
adaptability. However, current ICL methods rely on labor-intensive teleoperated
data for training, which restricts scalability. We propose using human play
videos -- continuous, unlabeled videos of people interacting freely with their
environment -- as a scalable and diverse training data source. We introduce
MimicDroid, which enables humanoids to perform ICL using human play videos as
the only training data. MimicDroid extracts trajectory pairs with similar
manipulation behaviors and trains the policy to predict the actions of one
trajectory conditioned on the other. Through this process, the model acquired
ICL capabilities for adapting to novel objects and environments at test time.
To bridge the embodiment gap, MimicDroid first retargets human wrist poses
estimated from RGB videos to the humanoid, leveraging kinematic similarity. It
also applies random patch masking during training to reduce overfitting to
human-specific cues and improve robustness to visual differences. To evaluate
few-shot learning for humanoids, we introduce an open-source simulation
benchmark with increasing levels of generalization difficulty. MimicDroid
outperformed state-of-the-art methods and achieved nearly twofold higher
success rates in the real world. Additional materials can be found on:

Conclusion: MIMo v2为研究婴儿发展提供了更真实的模拟工具。

Abstract: Infancy is characterized by rapid body growth and an explosive change of
sensory and motor abilities. However, developmental robots and simulation
platforms are typically designed in the image of a specific age, which limits
their ability to capture the changing abilities and constraints of developing
infants. To address this issue, we present MIMo v2, a new version of the
multimodal infant model. It includes a growing body with increasing actuation
strength covering the age range from birth to 24 months. It also features
foveated vision with developing visual acuity as well as sensorimotor delays
modeling finite signal transmission speeds to and from an infant's brain.
Further enhancements of this MIMo version include an inverse kinematics module,
a random environment generator and updated compatiblity with third-party
simulation and learning libraries. Overall, this new MIMo version permits
increased realism when modeling various aspects of sensorimotor development.

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly experimented in public and assistive settings,
but their accessibility for Deaf users remains quite underexplored. Italian
Sign Language (LIS) is a fully-fledged natural language that relies on complex
manual and non-manual components. Enabling robots to communicate using LIS
could foster more inclusive human robot interaction, especially in social
environments such as hospitals, airports, or educational settings. This study
investigates whether a commercial social robot, Pepper, can produce
intelligible LIS signs and short signed LIS sentences. With the help of a Deaf
student and his interpreter, an expert in LIS, we co-designed and implemented
52 LIS signs on Pepper using either manual animation techniques or a MATLAB
based inverse kinematics solver. We conducted a exploratory user study
involving 12 participants proficient in LIS, both Deaf and hearing.
Participants completed a questionnaire featuring 15 single-choice video-based
sign recognition tasks and 2 open-ended questions on short signed sentences.
Results shows that the majority of isolated signs were recognized correctly,
although full sentence recognition was significantly lower due to Pepper's
limited articulation and temporal constraints. Our findings demonstrate that
even commercially available social robots like Pepper can perform a subset of
LIS signs intelligibly, offering some opportunities for a more inclusive
interaction design. Future developments should address multi-modal enhancements
(e.g., screen-based support or expressive avatars) and involve Deaf users in
participatory design to refine robot expressivity and usability.

TL;DR: SART是一种从单次人类演示中学习机器人策略的框架，通过自主增强数据，减少人力和保证安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习需要大量数据，且探索过程缺乏安全保证，SART旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SART分为两个阶段：单次人类演示和机器人自主生成安全轨迹。

Result: SART在仿真和实际任务中比仅依赖人类演示的策略表现更好。

Conclusion: SART高效且安全，显著提升了模仿学习的性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot agents;
however, standard approaches typically require substantial data acquisition --
via numerous demonstrations or random exploration -- to ensure reliable
performance. Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety
guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in
clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual
environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes
Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy
learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset
through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human
teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision
boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated,
followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot
generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and
reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data
collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety.
Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that
SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely
on human-collected demonstrations. Video results available at

Abstract: Ensuring the safe and reliable operation of robotic systems is paramount to
prevent potential disasters and safeguard human well-being. Despite rigorous
design and engineering practices, these systems can still experience
malfunctions, leading to safety risks. In this study, we present a machine
learning-based approach for detecting anomalies in system logs to enhance the
safety and reliability of robotic systems. We collected logs from two distinct
scenarios using CoppeliaSim and comparatively evaluated several machine
learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine
(SVM), and an Autoencoder. Our system was evaluated in a quadcopter context
(Context 1) and a Pioneer robot context (Context 2). Results showed that while
LR demonstrated superior performance in Context 1, the Autoencoder model proved
to be the most effective in Context 2. This highlights that the optimal model
choice is context-dependent, likely due to the varying complexity of anomalies
across different robotic platforms. This research underscores the value of a
comparative approach and demonstrates the particular strengths of autoencoders
for detecting complex anomalies in robotic systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于仿真的柔顺机构设计工具，用于优化任务级目标的设计参数，提升插入任务中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 柔顺性是动态接触丰富操作中的关键设计参数，现有设计方法（硬件迭代或简化模型）效率低或无法解决复杂任务目标。

Method: 开发仿真工具，优化柔顺手指的设计参数，并通过NIST基准任务板的实验验证鲁棒性。

Result: 优化参数可显著提升容忍范围（达2.29倍），补偿工件变异性达8.6 mm，但趋势因任务而异。

Conclusion: 设计工具需考虑应用特定的几何与动态特性，针对不同任务优化柔顺性。

Abstract: Mechanical compliance is a key design parameter for dynamic contact-rich
manipulation, affecting task success and safety robustness over contact
geometry variation. Design of soft robotic structures, such as compliant
fingers, requires choosing design parameters which affect geometry and
stiffness, and therefore manipulation performance and robustness. Today, these
parameters are chosen through either hardware iteration, which takes
significant development time, or simplified models (e.g. planar), which can't
address complex manipulation task objectives. Improvements in dynamic
simulation, especially with contact and friction modeling, present a potential
design tool for mechanical compliance. We propose a simulation-based design
tool for compliant mechanisms which allows design with respect to task-level
objectives, such as success rate. This is applied to optimize design parameters
of a structured compliant finger to reduce failure cases inside a tolerance
window in insertion tasks. The improvement in robustness is then validated on a
real robot using tasks from the benchmark NIST task board. The finger stiffness
affects the tolerance window: optimized parameters can increase tolerable
ranges by a factor of 2.29, with workpiece variation up to 8.6 mm being
compensated. However, the trends remain task-specific. In some tasks, the
highest stiffness yields the widest tolerable range, whereas in others the
opposite is observed, motivating need for design tools which can consider
application-specific geometry and dynamics.

Method: 研究设计了两种球形测绘系统（轻量非驱动型和驱动型），并基于资源受限硬件运行LiDAR-惯性里程计（LIO）算法，评估其地图准确性。

Result: 结果表明，球形运动引入的高动态运动会导致LIO算法性能下降，产生全局不一致的地图或不可恢复的漂移。

Conclusion: 球形机器人的动态运动对LIO算法的地图构建精度有显著负面影响，需进一步优化以提升性能。

Abstract: Spherical robots offer unique advantages for mapping applications in
hazardous or confined environments, thanks to their protective shells and
omnidirectional mobility. This work presents two complementary spherical
mapping systems: a lightweight, non-actuated design and an actuated variant
featuring internal pendulum-driven locomotion. Both systems are equipped with a
Livox Mid-360 solid-state LiDAR sensor and run LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO)
algorithms on resource-constrained hardware. We assess the mapping accuracy of
these systems by comparing the resulting 3D point-clouds from the LIO
algorithms to a ground truth map. The results indicate that the performance of
state-of-the-art LIO algorithms deteriorates due to the high dynamic movement
introduced by the spherical locomotion, leading to globally inconsistent maps
and sometimes unrecoverable drift.

Conclusion: TwinTac为跨领域学习任务中的触觉感知模拟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Robot skill acquisition processes driven by reinforcement learning often rely
on simulations to efficiently generate large-scale interaction data. However,
the absence of simulation models for tactile sensors has hindered the use of
tactile sensing in such skill learning processes, limiting the development of
effective policies driven by tactile perception. To bridge this gap, we present
TwinTac, a system that combines the design of a physical tactile sensor with
its digital twin model. Our hardware sensor is designed for high sensitivity
and a wide measurement range, enabling high quality sensing data essential for
object interaction tasks. Building upon the hardware sensor, we develop the
digital twin model using a real-to-sim approach. This involves collecting
synchronized cross-domain data, including finite element method results and the
physical sensor's outputs, and then training neural networks to map simulated
data to real sensor responses. Through experimental evaluation, we
characterized the sensitivity of the physical sensor and demonstrated the
consistency of the digital twin in replicating the physical sensor's output.
Furthermore, by conducting an object classification task, we showed that
simulation data generated by our digital twin sensor can effectively augment
real-world data, leading to improved accuracy. These results highlight
TwinTac's potential to bridge the gap in cross-domain learning tasks.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法优于现有技术，解决了运动跟踪控制中的时间约束和物理限制问题。

Abstract: This paper studies the kinematic tracking control problem for aerial
manipulators. Existing kinematic tracking control methods, which typically
employ proportional-derivative feedback or tracking-error-based feedback
strategies, may fail to achieve tracking objectives within specified time
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel control framework
comprising two key components: end-effector tracking control based on a
user-defined preset trajectory and quadratic programming-based reference
allocation. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method has
several attractive features. First, it ensures that the end-effector reaches
the desired position within a preset time while keeping the tracking error
within a performance envelope that reflects task requirements. Second,
quadratic programming is employed to allocate the references of the quadcopter
base and the Delta arm, while considering the physical constraints of the
aerial manipulator, thus preventing solutions that may violate physical
limitations. The proposed approach is validated through three experiments.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
and its capability to guarantee that the target position is reached within the
preset time.

Abstract: The increasing labor shortage and aging population underline the need for
assistive robots to support human care recipients. To enable safe and
responsive assistance, robots require accurate human motion prediction in
physical interaction scenarios. However, this remains a challenging task due to
the variability of assistive settings and the complexity of coupled dynamics in
physical interactions. In this work, we address these challenges through two
key contributions: (1) HHI-Assist, a dataset comprising motion capture clips of
human-human interactions in assistive tasks; and (2) a conditional
Transformer-based denoising diffusion model for predicting the poses of
interacting agents. Our model effectively captures the coupled dynamics between
caregivers and care receivers, demonstrating improvements over baselines and
strong generalization to unseen scenarios. By advancing interaction-aware
motion prediction and introducing a new dataset, our work has the potential to
significantly enhance robotic assistance policies. The dataset and code are

Abstract: Legged robots are promising candidates for exploring challenging areas on
low-gravity bodies such as the Moon, Mars, or asteroids, thanks to their
advanced mobility on unstructured terrain. However, as planetary robots' power
and thermal budgets are highly restricted, these robots need energy-efficient
control approaches that easily transfer to multiple gravity environments. In
this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based control approach for
legged robots with gravity-scaled power-optimized reward functions. We use our
approach to develop and validate a locomotion controller and a base pose
controller in gravity environments from lunar gravity (1.62 m/s2) to a
hypothetical super-Earth (19.62 m/s2). Our approach successfully scales across
these gravity levels for locomotion and base pose control with the
gravity-scaled reward functions. The power-optimized locomotion controller
reached a power consumption for locomotion of 23.4 W in Earth gravity on a
15.65 kg robot at 0.4 m/s, a 23 % improvement over the baseline policy.
Additionally, we designed a constant-force spring offload system that allowed
us to conduct real-world experiments on legged locomotion in lunar gravity. In
lunar gravity, the power-optimized control policy reached 12.2 W, 36 % less
than a baseline controller which is not optimized for power efficiency. Our
method provides a scalable approach to developing power-efficient locomotion
controllers for legged robots across multiple gravity levels.

Conclusion: GundamQ通过多尺度时空建模和自适应优化，显著提升了动态环境中的机器人路径规划性能。

Abstract: In dynamic and uncertain environments, robotic path planning demands accurate
spatiotemporal environment understanding combined with robust decision-making
under partial observability. However, current deep reinforcement learning-based
path planning methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient
modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal
adaptability in dynamic scenarios, and (2) inefficient exploration-exploitation
balance, leading to degraded path quality. To address these challenges, we
propose GundamQ: A Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Q-Network for Robotic Path
Planning. The framework comprises two key modules: (i) the Spatiotemporal
Perception module, which hierarchically extracts multi-granularity spatial
features and multi-scale temporal dependencies ranging from instantaneous to
extended time horizons, thereby improving perception accuracy in dynamic
environments; and (ii) the Adaptive Policy Optimization module, which balances
exploration and exploitation during training while optimizing for smoothness
and collision probability through constrained policy updates. Experiments in
dynamic environments demonstrate that GundamQ achieves a 15.3\% improvement in
success rate and a 21.7\% increase in overall path quality, significantly
outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The work describes the development of a hybrid control architecture for an
anthropomorphic tour guide robot, combining a multi-agent resource management
system with automatic behavior scenario generation based on large language
models. The proposed approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional
systems, which rely on manual tuning of behavior scenarios. These limitations
include manual configuration, low flexibility, and lack of naturalness in robot
behavior. The process of preparing tour scenarios is implemented through a
two-stage generation: first, a stylized narrative is created, then non-verbal
action tags are integrated into the text. The multi-agent system ensures
coordination and conflict resolution during the execution of parallel actions,
as well as maintaining default behavior after the completion of main
operations, contributing to more natural robot behavior. The results obtained
from the trial demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for
automating and scaling social robot control systems.

Conclusion: Acetrans通过统一框架有效解决了无人机悬挂负载运输中的关键问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with suspended payloads offer significant
advantages for aerial transportation in complex and cluttered environments.
However, existing systems face critical limitations, including unreliable
perception of the cable-payload dynamics, inefficient planning in large-scale
environments, and the inability to guarantee whole-body safety under cable
bending and external disturbances. This paper presents Acetrans, an Autonomous,
Corridor-based, and Efficient UAV suspended transport system that addresses
these challenges through a unified perception, planning, and control framework.
A LiDAR-IMU fusion module is proposed to jointly estimate both payload pose and
cable shape under taut and bent modes, enabling robust whole-body state
estimation and real-time filtering of cable point clouds. To enhance planning
scalability, we introduce the Multi-size-Aware Configuration-space Iterative
Regional Inflation (MACIRI) algorithm, which generates safe flight corridors
while accounting for varying UAV and payload geometries. A spatio-temporal,
corridor-constrained trajectory optimization scheme is then developed to ensure
dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories. Finally, a nonlinear
model predictive controller (NMPC) augmented with cable-bending constraints
provides robust whole-body safety during execution. Simulation and experimental
results validate the effectiveness of Acetrans, demonstrating substantial
improvements in perception accuracy, planning efficiency, and control safety
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验表明该方法与监督学习方法竞争，且能泛化到不同领域和多机器人场景。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部监督或先验知识，实现了高效的自监督姿态估计。

Abstract: We introduce a model for monocular RGB relative pose estimation of a ground
robot that trains from scratch without pose labels nor prior knowledge about
the robot's shape or appearance. At training time, we assume: (i) a robot
fitted with multiple LEDs, whose states are independent and known at each
frame; (ii) knowledge of the approximate viewing direction of each LED; and
(iii) availability of a calibration image with a known target distance, to
address the ambiguity of monocular depth estimation. Training data is collected
by a pair of robots moving randomly without needing external infrastructure or
human supervision. Our model trains on the task of predicting from an image the
state of each LED on the robot. In doing so, it learns to predict the position
of the robot in the image, its distance, and its relative bearing. At inference
time, the state of the LEDs is unknown, can be arbitrary, and does not affect
the pose estimation performance. Quantitative experiments indicate that our
approach: is competitive with SoA approaches that require supervision from pose
labels or a CAD model of the robot; generalizes to different domains; and
handles multi-robot pose estimation.

Motivation: 解决通用、长期共享控制中的两大挑战：任务级用户意图的理解与推断，以及辅助功能的多样化对象和任务泛化。

Method: 使用视觉输入构建开放词汇的交互图来表示对象间的功能关系，并通过视觉-语言模型预测空间约束来指导共享控制策略。

Result: 实验表明，TASC在仿真和现实中均能提高任务效率并减少用户输入负担，且是首个支持零样本泛化的日常操作任务的共享控制框架。

Conclusion: TASC成功实现了无需预定义知识的任务级辅助控制，并在多样化和零样本任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We present TASC, a Task-Aware Shared Control framework for teleoperated
manipulation that infers task-level user intent and provides assistance
throughout the task. To support everyday tasks without predefined knowledge,
TASC constructs an open-vocabulary interaction graph from visual input to
represent functional object relationships, and infers user intent accordingly.
A shared control policy then provides rotation assistance during both grasping
and object interaction, guided by spatial constraints predicted by a
vision-language model. Our method addresses two key challenges in
general-purpose, long-horizon shared control: (1) understanding and inferring
task-level user intent, and (2) generalizing assistance across diverse objects
and tasks. Experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that
TASC improves task efficiency and reduces user input effort compared to prior
methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first shared control
framework that supports everyday manipulation tasks with zero-shot
generalization. The code that supports our experiments is publicly available at
https://github.com/fitz0401/tasc.

TL;DR: 提出了DECAMP框架，用于多智能体运动预测，通过解耦行为模式学习和潜在特征重构，并结合上下文感知表示学习，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在多智能体预测场景中因数据稀缺和性能不足而受限。

Method: 引入DECAMP框架，解耦行为学习与特征重构，结合上下文感知表示学习和协作空间-运动预任务。

Result: 在Argoverse 2基准测试中表现优异，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DECAMP是首个用于自动驾驶多智能体运动预测的上下文自编码器框架。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving,
essential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However,
traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and
exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address
these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training
framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing
methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework
decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction,
prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation
for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates
context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion
pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional
reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on
the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and
the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion
forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context
autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving.
The code and models will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种运动规划层，以减少超级机器人肢体的力矩，从而优化人机交互，并通过仿真验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超级机器人肢体虽然能增强人类能力，但其运行时产生的力矩会增加人体肌肉负荷，减少肌肉冗余空间。因此，研究旨在通过改进运动规划减少这种力矩。

Method: 提出一种运动规划层，修改给定轨迹，限制角加速度和位置偏差，以减少力矩。通过简化的人体和机器人模型进行仿真验证。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该运动规划层能有效减少机器人肢体操作时产生的力矩。

Conclusion: 该运动规划层通过优化轨迹，显著减少了力矩，改善了人机交互的舒适性。

Abstract: Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) can enhance human capability within close
proximity. However, as a wearable device, the generated moment from its
operation acts on the human body as an external torque. When the moments
increase, more muscle units are activated for balancing, and it can result in
reduced muscular null space. Therefore, this paper suggests a concept of a
motion planning layer that reduces the generated moment for enhanced
Human-Robot Interaction. It modifies given trajectories with desirable angular
acceleration and position deviation limits. Its performance to reduce the
moment is demonstrated through the simulation, which uses simplified human and
robotic system models.

<details>

Method: 构建空间约束库，将指令解析为有向无环图，通过约束求解确定导航路径和终点。

Result: 在标准基准测试中显著优于现有零样本方法，并在现实环境中验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为视觉与语言导航提供了更鲁棒和自主的解决方案，具备实际部署潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training-free framework for vision-and-language
navigation (VLN). Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for
discrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator
environments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in
real-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous
environments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint
optimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The
constraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint
solving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we
construct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial
relationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed
into a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges,
which are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph
constraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint
solver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's
navigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple
solutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world
experiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new
environments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and
autonomous navigation framework.

Motivation: 传统强化学习缺乏稳定性保证，且现有自学习李雅普诺夫函数因策略性特点导致样本效率低下。

Method: 提出一种离策略学习李雅普诺夫函数的方法，并将其融入Soft Actor Critic和Proximal Policy Optimization算法。

Result: 仿真实验（倒立摆和四旋翼）表明，增强后的算法性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 离策略李雅普诺夫函数是一种高效稳定性认证方法，可用于强化学习算法。

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning lacks the ability to provide stability
guarantees. More recent algorithms learn Lyapunov functions alongside the
control policies to ensure stable learning. However, the current self-learned
Lyapunov functions are sample inefficient due to their on-policy nature. This
paper introduces a method for learning Lyapunov functions off-policy and
incorporates the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function into the Soft Actor
Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms to provide them with a data
efficient stability certificate. Simulations of an inverted pendulum and a
quadrotor illustrate the improved performance of the two algorithms when
endowed with the proposed off-policy Lyapunov function.

Abstract: This paper introduces a Data-Fused Model Predictive Control (DFMPC) framework
that combines physics-based models with data-driven representations of unknown

formulation, the method enables tracking of changing, potentially unreachable
setpoints while explicitly handling measurement noise through slack variables
and regularization. We provide guarantees of recursive feasibility and
practical stability under input-output constraints for a specific class of
reference signals. The approach is validated on the iRonCub flying humanoid
robot, integrating analytical momentum models with data-driven turbine
dynamics. Simulations show improved tracking and robustness compared to a
purely model-based MPC, while maintaining real-time feasibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G及以后网络的高速率、超可靠和低延迟需求导致无线接入网（RAN）能耗激增，对运营商在运营和可持续性方面带来挑战。O-RAN的开放架构增加了复杂性，需解决能耗管理问题。

Method: 采用启发式方法和无监督机器学习结合的混合xApp，集成数字孪生技术（TeraVM AI-RSG），动态管理RU的睡眠模式。

Result: 在大型仿真O-RAN场景中，实验显示该方案节省约13%的能源，且不影响用户服务质量。

Conclusion: 混合xApp方案在实际部署中具有显著潜力和实用性，能够有效降低O-RAN能耗。

Abstract: The growing demand for high-speed, ultra-reliable, and low-latency
communications in 5G and beyond networks has significantly driven up power
consumption, particularly within the Radio Access Network (RAN). This surge in
energy demand poses critical operational and sustainability challenges for
mobile network operators, necessitating innovative solutions that enhance
energy efficiency without compromising Quality of Service (QoS). Open Radio
Access Network (O-RAN), spearheaded by the O-RAN Alliance, offers
disaggregated, programmable, and intelligent architectures, promoting
flexibility, interoperability, and cost-effectiveness. However, this
disaggregated approach adds complexity, particularly in managing power
consumption across diverse network components such as Open Radio Units (RUs).
In this paper, we propose a hybrid xApp leveraging heuristic methods and
unsupervised machine learning, integrated with digital twin technology through
the TeraVM AI RAN Scenario Generator (AI-RSG). This approach dynamically
manages RU sleep modes to effectively reduce energy consumption. Our
experimental evaluation in a realistic, large-scale emulated Open RAN scenario
demonstrates that the hybrid xApp achieves approximately 13% energy savings,
highlighting its practicality and significant potential for real-world
deployments without compromising user QoS.

Conclusion: 通过深度引导的动态融合策略和鲁棒的损失函数设计，DGFusion显著提升了复杂环境下的语义感知能力。

Abstract: Robust semantic perception for autonomous vehicles relies on effectively
combining multiple sensors with complementary strengths and weaknesses.
State-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches to semantic perception often treat
sensor data uniformly across the spatial extent of the input, which hinders
performance when faced with challenging conditions. By contrast, we propose a
novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware
fusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses
multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar
measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as
one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our
corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which
are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our
attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these
local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying
reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In
addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for
learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse
conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic
segmentation performance on the challenging MUSES and DELIVER datasets. Code

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种高效且精确的视觉惯性里程计（VIO）流程，专为微型和纳米无人机优化，通过使用先进的特征检测和跟踪方法以及在低功耗SoC上的量化优化，显著提升了精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高精度VIO流程通常需要强大的计算系统，而本文旨在填补这一差距，为微型和纳米无人机等资源受限的环境提供轻量级实现方案。

Method: 论文结合了SuperPoint、PX4FLOW和ORB等先进特征检测与跟踪方法，并通过刚体运动模型减少估计误差，同时在RISC-V低功耗SoC上进行了优化和量化。

Result: 在GAP9低功耗SoC上，优化后的流程在使用ORB特征跟踪器时，平均RMSE降低了3.65倍；PX4FLOW在低速运动下实现了与ORB相当的精度且运行时更低。

Conclusion: 该流程成功实现了高精度VIO在资源受限设备上的轻量化部署，为微型无人机等应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a widely used computer vision method that
determines an agent's movement through a camera and an IMU sensor. This paper
presents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on
micro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature
detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and
quantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips
(SoCs). Furthermore, by employing a rigid body motion model, the pipeline
reduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion
scenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an
ultra-low-power SoC in terms of compute requirements and tracking accuracy
after quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods,
was implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the
gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on
computationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for
microcontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates
an average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline
pipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational
complexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par
tracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24
pixels/frame.

Motivation: 现有土壤湿度监测方法需要侵入性探测或专业设备，限制了公众使用，因此开发了一种无需扰动土壤的便捷解决方案。

Method: 利用智能手机内置扬声器和麦克风进行垂直扫描，通过声学反射模型和卷积神经网络实时估算土壤湿度。

Result: 在10个不同地点测试中，平均绝对误差为2.39%，湿度范围15.9%至34.0%，适用于多种土壤和环境。

Conclusion: SoilSound提供了一种无需校准或扰动土壤的广泛可用的湿度监测方案，适用于家庭园艺、城市农业和资源有限地区。

Abstract: Soil moisture monitoring is essential for agriculture and environmental
management, yet existing methods require either invasive probes disturbing the
soil or specialized equipment, limiting access to the public. We present
SoilSound, an ubiquitous accessible smartphone-based acoustic sensing system
that can measure soil moisture without disturbing the soil. We leverage the
built-in speaker and microphone to perform a vertical scan mechanism to
accurately measure moisture without any calibration. Unlike existing work that
use transmissive properties, we propose an alternate model for acoustic
reflections in soil based on the surface roughness effect to enable moisture
sensing without disturbing the soil. The system works by sending acoustic
chirps towards the soil and recording the reflections during a vertical scan,
which are then processed and fed to a convolutional neural network for
on-device soil moisture estimation with negligible computational, memory, or
power overhead. We evaluated the system by training with curated soils in boxes
in the lab and testing in the outdoor fields and show that SoilSound achieves a
mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.39% across 10 different locations. Overall, the
evaluation shows that SoilSound can accurately track soil moisture levels
ranging from 15.9% to 34.0% across multiple soil types, environments, and
users; without requiring any calibration or disturbing the soil, enabling
widespread moisture monitoring for home gardeners, urban farmers, citizen
scientists, and agricultural communities in resource-limited settings.

Conclusion: 为开发临床公平且泛化性强的模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is a widely adopted self-supervised pretraining
strategy, yet its dependence on cohort composition remains underexplored. We
present Contrasting by Patient Augmented Electrocardiograms (CAPE) foundation
model and pretrain on four cohorts (n = 5,203,352), from diverse populations
across three continents (North America, South America, Asia). We systematically
assess how cohort demographics, health status, and population diversity
influence the downstream performance for prediction tasks also including two
additional cohorts from another continent (Europe). We find that downstream
performance depends on the distributional properties of the pretraining cohort,
including demographics and health status. Moreover, while pretraining with a
multi-centre, demographically diverse cohort improves in-distribution accuracy,
it reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation of our contrastive approach
by encoding cohort-specific artifacts. To address this, we propose the
In-Distribution Batch (IDB) strategy, which preserves intra-cohort consistency
during pretraining and enhances OOD robustness. This work provides important
insights for developing clinically fair and generalisable foundation models.

Motivation: 现有跨模态迁移学习方法需要训练和推理时使用配对传感器数据，限制了在资源受限环境中的应用。为了克服这一问题，作者提出了一种无需联合传感器模态的解决方案。

Method: 提出的D-CAT框架结合了自注意力模块进行特征提取和新型跨注意力对齐损失函数，无需耦合分类流程即可对齐传感器特征空间。

Conclusion: D-CAT通过减少硬件冗余并保持准确性，适用于成本敏感或传感器可用性多变的环境（如家庭辅助机器人）。

Abstract: Cross-modal transfer learning is used to improve multi-modal classification
models (e.g., for human activity recognition in human-robot collaboration).
However, existing methods require paired sensor data at both training and
inference, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments where full
sensor suites are not economically and technically usable. To address this, we
propose Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer (D-CAT), a framework that aligns
modality-specific representations without requiring joint sensor modality
during inference. Our approach combines a self-attention module for feature
extraction with a novel cross-attention alignment loss, which enforces the
alignment of sensors' feature spaces without requiring the coupling of the
classification pipelines of both modalities. We evaluate D-CAT on three
multi-modal human activity datasets (IMU, video, and audio) under both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, comparing against uni-modal
models. Results show that in in-distribution scenarios, transferring from
high-performing modalities (e.g., video to IMU) yields up to 10% F1-score gains
over uni-modal training. In out-of-distribution scenarios, even weaker source
modalities (e.g., IMU to video) improve target performance, as long as the
target model isn't overfitted on the training data. By enabling single-sensor
inference with cross-modal knowledge, D-CAT reduces hardware redundancy for
perception systems while maintaining accuracy, which is critical for
cost-sensitive or adaptive deployments (e.g., assistive robots in homes with
variable sensor availability). Code is available at

Motivation: 在实践中，执行MAPF计划时机器人可能因延迟而影响执行时间，因此需要一种方法来决定何时寻找替代计划以避免不必要的高成本。

Method: 采用Action Dependency Graph作为鲁棒执行方法，实时估计计划执行时间，并预测寻找替代计划的潜在优势。

Result: 实验在模拟仓库机器人环境中验证了该架构的有效性。

Conclusion: 该架构能够有效监控和优化MAPF计划的执行，减少因延迟导致的执行时间延长。

Abstract: The goal of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is to find a set of paths for a
fleet of agents moving in a shared environment such that the agents reach their
goals without colliding with each other. In practice, some of the robots
executing the plan may get delayed, which can introduce collision risk.
Although robust execution methods are used to ensure safety even in the
presence of delays, the delays may still have a significant impact on the
duration of the execution. At some point, the accumulated delays may become
significant enough that instead of continuing with the execution of the
original plan, even if it was optimal, there may now exist an alternate plan
which will lead to a shorter execution. However, the problem is how to decide
when to search for the alternate plan, since it is a costly procedure. In this
paper, we propose a holistic architecture for robust execution of MAPF plans,
its monitoring and optimization. We exploit a robust execution method called
Action Dependency Graph to maintain an estimate of the expected execution
duration during the plan's execution. This estimate is used to predict the
potential that finding an alternate plan would lead to shorter execution. We
empirically evaluate the architecture in experiments in a real-time simulator
which we designed to mimic our real-life demonstrator of an autonomous
warehouse robotic fleet.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is ushering in a new era for communication. As a
result, the establishment of a semantic communication framework is putting on
the agenda. Based on a realistic semantic communication model, this paper
develops a rate-distortion framework for semantic compression. Different from
the existing works primarily focusing on decoder-side estimation of intrinsic
meaning and ignoring its inherent issues, such as ambiguity and polysemy, we
exploit a constraint of conditional semantic probability distortion to
effectively capture the essential features of practical semantic exchanges in
an AI-assisted communication system. With the help of the methods in
rate-distortion-perception theory, we establish a theorem specifying the
minimum achievable rate under this semantic constraint and a traditional
symbolic constraint and obtain its closed-form limit for a particular semantic
scenario. From the experiments in this paper, bounding conditional semantic
probability distortion can effectively improve both semantic transmission
accuracy and bit-rate efficiency. Our framework bridges information theory and

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents deployed in real-world environments face
degradation from sensor faults, actuator wear, and environmental shifts, yet
lack intrinsic mechanisms to detect and diagnose these failures. We present an
information-theoretic framework that reveals both the fundamental dynamics of
RL and provides practical methods for diagnosing deployment-time anomalies.
Through analysis of state-action mutual information patterns in a robotic
control task, we first demonstrate that successful learning exhibits
characteristic information signatures: mutual information between states and
actions steadily increases from 0.84 to 2.83 bits (238% growth) despite growing
state entropy, indicating that agents develop increasingly selective attention
to task-relevant patterns. Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint
mutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during
early learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a
transition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately
actionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system
failures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad
collapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action
coupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts
action-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships. This
differential diagnostic capability demonstrated through controlled perturbation
experiments enables precise fault localization without architectural
modifications or performance degradation. By establishing information patterns
as both signatures of learning and diagnostic for system health, we provide the
foundation for adaptive RL systems capable of autonomous fault detection and
policy adjustment based on information-theoretic principles.
