In this work, we present COMET, a framework of CNN designs that\nemploy efficient hardware offset-binary coding (OBC) techniques to enable\nco-optimization of performance and resource utilization. The approach\nformulates CNN inference with OBC representations of inputs (Scheme A) and\nweights (Scheme B) separately, enabling exploitation of bit-width asymmetry.\nThe shift-accumulate operation is modified by incorporating the offset term\nwith the pre-scaled bias. Leveraging inherent symmetries in Schemes A and B, we\nintroduce four novel look-up table (LUT) techniques -- parallel, shared, split,\nand hybrid -- and analyze them to identify the most efficient options. Building\non this foundation, we develop an OBC-based general matrix multiplication core\nusing the im2col transformation, enabling efficient acceleration of a\nfixed-point modified LeNet-5 model.

We study the associated on-grid DD-domain representations\nfor continuous-time, doubly selective channels with off-grid delay and Doppler\nshifts, accounting for practical time/frequency-domain windowing at the\ntransceivers. The universal models obtained are applicable under the mild\nassumption that the windows have finite supports, and they extend Bello's\nclassical results to account for more general windows.

Our approach employs a recurrent GRU-based architecture with\nadditional non-linear layers to capture object-environment dynamics while\nensuring stability. A tailored state-action representation enables the model to\ngeneralize across uncertain dynamics, variable push lengths, and diverse tasks.\nFor control, we integrate the learned dynamics with a sampling-based Model\nPredictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller, which generates adaptive,\ntask-oriented actions. This framework supports side switching, variable-length\npushes, and objectives such as precise positioning, trajectory following, and\nobstacle avoidance. Training is performed in simulation with domain\nrandomization to support sim-to-real transfer. We first evaluate the\narchitecture through ablation studies, showing improved prediction accuracy and\nstable rollouts. We then validate the full system in simulation and real-world\nexperiments using a Franka Panda robot with markerless tracking.

To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA)\nframework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories,\nthereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory\nfine-tuning.

To address this, optimal control policies have been developed to\nenforce safety while ensuring high performance.

Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes\nperformance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining\naccurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven\nalternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on\nhand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal\npolicies directly from interaction data. Data-enabled predictive control\n(DeePC) goes further by bypassing modeling altogether, directly learning safe\npolicies from raw input-output data. Recently, large language model (LLM)\nagents have also emerged, translating natural language instructions into\nstructured formulations of optimal control problems.

For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each,\nderive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on\nhardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip\nlimits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an\neight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg\nprovides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke\ndouble rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far\nricher gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we\nused deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored\nspace. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under\nthe right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that\nTARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple\npreviously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search\nis likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and\nreinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics."}

The effectiveness of the proposed shape-adaptive\nAAN strategy was validated on a telerobotic rehabilitation system using two\nrepresentative tasks. The results demonstrate its practicality for remote AAN\ntherapy and its superiority over two state-of-the-art methods in reducing\ncorrective force and improving movement smoothness."}

We develop a new formulation for ball-shaped ambiguity sets of\nGaussian distributions and leverage it to develop a distributionally robust\nbelief roadmap construction algorithm. This algorithm synthe- sizes robust\ncontrollers which are certified to be safe for maximal size ball-shaped\nambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions. Our algorithm achieves better\ncoverage than the maximal coverage algorithm for planning over Gaussian\ndistributions [1], and we identify mild conditions under which our algorithm\nachieves strictly better coverage. For the special case of no process noise or\nstate constraints, we formally prove that our algorithm achieves maximal\ncoverage. In addition, we present a second multi-query motion planning\nalgorithm for linear Gaussian systems with the goal of reaching a region\nparameterized by the Minkowski sum of an ellipsoid and a Euclidean ball with\nhigh probability. This algorithm plans over ellipsoidal sets of maximal size\nball-shaped ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions, and provably achieves\nequal or better coverage than the best-known algorithm for planning over\nellipsoidal ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions [2]. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of both methods in a wide range of conditions via extensive simulation\nexperiments."}
