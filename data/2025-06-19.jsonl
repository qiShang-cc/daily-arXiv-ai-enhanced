In this paper, we propose a novel\nOOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize\nmulti-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB\nmodalities, i.e., vision and location.

Further, considering the\nheterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the\nsmall-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a\nheterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update\nvarious neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,\nsimulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing\ncomputational offloading and resource allocation."}

However, controlling the generation\nprocess to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.\nEven a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can\ndrastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the\napplication of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.\nSpecifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained\ntext-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the\nunderlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the\noverall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,\nand finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen\nintermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a\nbalance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the\ndesired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the\ntext-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's\nspeed."}
