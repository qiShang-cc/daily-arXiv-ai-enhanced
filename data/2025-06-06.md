Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究开发并部署了一种基于WiFi的大规模家庭监控系统，解决了实际应用中面临的四大挑战，并显著提升了准确性和效率。系统在真实环境中表现优异，同时支持WiFi感知和数据传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: WiFi-based home monitoring has emerged as a compelling alternative to
traditional camera- and sensor-based solutions, offering wide coverage with
minimal intrusion by leveraging existing wireless infrastructure. This paper
presents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a
large-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million
commodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through
this extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder
the practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets)
frequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous
hardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI)
measurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates
occupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and
limited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these
challenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through
comprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16
scenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy
of 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to
non-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead
by 99.72%. Notably, our system integrates sensing and communication, supporting
simultaneous WiFi sensing and data transmission over home WiFi networks. While
focused on home monitoring, our findings and strategies generalize to various
WiFi sensing applications. By bridging the gaps between theoretical research
and commercial deployment, this work offers practical insights for scaling WiFi
sensing in real-world environments.

### [2] [DAS-MAE: A self-supervised pre-training framework for universal and high-performance representation learning of distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04552)
*Junyi Duan,Jiageng Chen,Zuyuan He*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自监督预训练框架DAS-MAE，用于分析分布式光纤声学传感（DAS）信号的空间时间特性，无需标签即可学习高级表示，显著提高了少样本分类和实际应用中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAS信号的空间时间特性和缺乏直观物理对应关系使得传统图像处理方法效果不佳，需要新的方法来处理这种复杂信号。

Method: 作者提出了DAS-MAE框架，通过掩码重建任务自监督学习信号的表示，无需标签即可捕获事件类别等高级特征。

Result: DAS-MAE在少样本分类任务中达到1%的错误率和64.5%的相对改进；在实际应用中，识别错误率为5.0%，相对改进达75.7%。

Conclusion: DAS-MAE框架能够高效学习DAS信号的通用表示，为分析大量未标记DAS信号提供了基础模型。

Abstract: Distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing (DAS) has emerged as a
transformative approach for distributed vibration measurement with high spatial
resolution and long measurement range while maintaining cost-efficiency.
However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal DAS signals present analytical
challenges. The abstract signal morphology lacking intuitive physical
correspondence complicates human interpretation, and its unique
spatial-temporal coupling renders conventional image processing methods
suboptimal. This study investigates spatial-temporal characteristics and
proposes a self-supervised pre-training framework that learns signals'
representations through a mask-reconstruction task. This framework is named the
DAS Masked AutoEncoder (DAS-MAE). The DAS-MAE learns high-level representations
(e.g., event class) without using labels. It achieves up to 1% error and 64.5%
relative improvement (RI) over the semi-supervised baseline in few-shot
classification tasks. In a practical external damage prevention application,
DAS-MAE attains a 5.0% recognition error, marking a 75.7% RI over supervised
training from scratch. These results demonstrate the high-performance and
universal representations learned by the DAS-MAE framework, highlighting its
potential as a foundation model for analyzing massive unlabeled DAS signals.

### [3] [Spectral Efficiency Maximization for mmWave MIMO-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Under Practical Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04683)
*Jitendra Singh,Anand Mehrotra,Suraj Srivastava,Aditya K. Jagannatham,Lajos Hanzo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种毫米波MIMO ISAC系统中的混合发射预编码和接收合并器设计，通过优化通信用户的总频谱效率，同时满足雷达波束相似性和功耗约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对毫米波MIMO ISAC系统，设计高性能的混合预编码和合并器以平衡通信和感知需求。

Method: 采用顺序设计方法，结合MM-based RCG技术和低复杂度线性MM盲合并器。

Result: 仿真显示，所提设计在性能和复杂度上优于现有方案。

Conclusion: 该混合设计在毫米波MIMO ISAC系统中展现了优越的性能和实用性。

Abstract: A hybrid transmit precoder (TPC) and receive combiner (RC) pair is conceived
for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The proposed design considers a
practical mean squared error (MSE) constraint between the desired and the
achieved beampatterns constructed for identifying radar targets (RTs). To
achieve optimal performance, we formulate an optimization problem relying on
sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization of the communication users (CUs),
while satisfying certain radar beampattern similarity (RBPS), total transmit
power, and constant modulus constraints, where the latter are attributed to the
hybrid mmWave MIMO architecture. Since the aforementioned problem is non-convex
and intractable, a sequential approach is proposed wherein the TPCs are
designed first, followed by the RCs. To deal with the non-convex MSE and
constant modulus constraints in the TPC design problem, we propose a
majorization and minimization (MM) based Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG)
method, which restricts the tolerable MSE of the beampattern to within a
predefined limit. Moreover, the least squares and the zero-forcing methods are
adopted for maximizing the sum-SE and for mitigating the multiuser interference
(MUI), respectively. Furthermore, to design the RC at each CU, we propose a
linear MM-based blind combiner (LMBC) scheme that does not rely on the
knowledge of the TPC at the CUs and has a low complexity. To achieve user
fairness, we further extend the proposed sequential approach for maximizing the
geometric mean (GM) of the CU's rate. Simulation results are presented, which
show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid TPC and RC in comparison
to the state-of-the-art designs in the mmWave MIMO ISAC systems under
consideration.

### [4] [Design of OTFS Signals with Pulse Shaping and Window Function for OTFS-Based Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04861)
*Liangchen Sun,Yutaka Jitsumatsu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于改进根升余弦窗的脉冲雷达系统，通过放宽窗函数值范围限制，实现更灵活的信号设计，结合OTFS信号传输，提升时延和多普勒频移的估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统窗函数值被限制在[0,1]范围内，限制了信号设计的灵活性。研究旨在通过改进窗函数，实现更高效的雷达信号处理。

Method: 采用广义根升余弦窗（允许负值和超过1的值），结合OTFS信号传输，并利用频域插值技术提升参数估计精度。

Result: 提出的方法在模糊函数中实现了时延和多普勒频移的尖锐集中，频域插值技术优于传统线性插值。

Conclusion: 改进窗函数结合OTFS信号传输可显著提升雷达系统的灵活性和参数估计精度。

Abstract: We propose a pulse radar system that employs a generalized window function
derived from the root raised cosine (RRC), which relaxes the conventional
constraint that the window values are within the range [0, 1]. The proposed
window allows both negative values and values exceeding 1, enabling greater
flexibility in signal design. The system transmits orthogonal time frequency
space (OTFS) signals intermittently, establishing a flexible input-output
relationship that captures both fractional delays and Doppler shifts. By
combining the generalized RRC window with a rectangular pulse, the resulting
pilot signal achieves a sharp concentration in the ambiguity function over both
the delay and Doppler domains. To enhance the estimation accuracy of fractional
parameters, we apply frequency-domain interpolation based on the
autocorrelation of the RRC window, which outperforms conventional linear
interpolation by preserving the signal structure more effectively.

Conclusion: 所提出的最大似然检测方法能够显著提升1位数模转换器大规模MIMO系统的性能，为低分辨率转换器提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: To leverage high-frequency bands in 6G wireless systems and beyond, employing
massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) arrays at the transmitter and/or
receiver side is crucial. To mitigate the power consumption and hardware
complexity across massive frequency bands and antenna arrays, a sacrifice in
the resolution of the data converters will be inevitable. In this paper, we
consider a point-to-point massive MIMO system with 1-bit digital-to-analog
converters at the transmitter, where the linearly precoded signal is
supplemented with dithering before the 1-bit quantization. For this system, we
propose a new maximumlikelihood (ML) data detection method at the receiver by
deriving the mean and covariance matrix of the received signal, where
symbol-dependent linear minimum mean squared error estimation is utilized to
efficiently linearize the transmitted signal. Numerical results show that the
proposed ML method can provide gains of more than two orders of magnitude in
terms of symbol error rate over conventional data detection based on soft
estimation.

Conclusion: 掐合天线系统在高频毫米波应用中比RIS更具优势，特别是在硬件损伤和路径损耗方面。

Abstract: Flexible and intelligent antenna designs, such as pinching antenna systems
and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), have gained extensive research
attention due to their potential to enhance the wireless channels. This letter,
for the first time, presents a comparative study between the emerging pinching
antenna systems and RIS in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. Our results reveal
that RIS requires an extremely large number of elements (in the order of
$10^4$) to outperform pinching antenna systems in terms of spectral efficiency,
which severely impact the energy efficiency performance of RIS. Moreover,
pinching antenna systems demonstrate greater robustness against hardware
impairments and severe path loss typically encountered in high-frequency mmWave

### [8] [An SCMA Receiver for 6G NTN based on Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05111)
*Bruno De Filippo,Carla Amatetti,Riccardo Campana,Alessandro Guidotti,Alessandro Vanelli-Coralli*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了在6G非地面网络（NTN）中应用人工智能（AI）改进SCMA接收机性能的方法，通过多任务学习优化信号分离，显著降低了误码率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需要更高效的数据传输和低延迟服务，但传统SCMA接收机因干扰问题性能受限，因此探索AI技术的应用。

Method: 使用多任务学习训练AI模型，用于分离和接收叠加的SCMA信号，并通过链路级仿真评估性能。

Result: 提出的AI接收机在相同误码率目标下，比基准算法降低了3.5dB的Eb/N0需求。

Conclusion: 尽管AI模型在低轨卫星上的实现存在复杂度挑战，但其在提升6G NTN性能方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Future 6G networks are envisioned to enhance the user experience in a
multitude of different ways. The unification of existing terrestrial networks
with non-terrestrial network (NTN) components will provide users with
ubiquitous connectivity. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) will enable
low-latency services, with computations performed closer to the end users, and
distributed learning paradigms. Advanced multiple access schemes, such as
sparse code multiple access (SCMA), can be employed to efficiently move data
from edge nodes to spaceborne MEC servers. However, the non-orthogonal nature
of SCMA results in interference, limiting the effectiveness of traditional SCMA
receivers. Hence, NTN links should be protected with robust channel codes,
significantly reducing the uplink throughput. Thus, we investigate the
application of artificial intelligence (AI) to SCMA receivers for 6G NTNs. We
train an AI model with multi-task learning to optimally separate and receive
superimposed SCMA signals. Through link level simulations, we evaluate the
block error rate (BLER) and the aggregated theoretical throughput achieved by
the AI model as a function of the received energy per bit over noise power
spectral density ratio (Eb/N0). We show that the proposed receiver achieves a
target 10% BLER with 3.5dB lower Eb/N0 with respect to the benchmark algorithm.
We conclude the assessment discussing the complexity-related challenges to the
implementation of the AI model on board of a low earth orbit satellite.

Abstract: Wearable and implantable healthcare sensors are pivotal for real-time patient
monitoring but face critical challenges in power efficiency, data security, and
signal noise. This paper introduces a novel platform that leverages hardware
noise as a dual-purpose resource to enhance machine learning (ML) robustness
and secure data via Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). By integrating
noise-driven signal processing, PUFbased authentication, and ML-based anomaly
detection, our system achieves secure, low-power monitoring for devices like
ECG wearables. Simulations demonstrate that noise improves ML accuracy by 8%
(92% for detecting premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and atrial
fibrillation (AF)), while PUFs provide 98% uniqueness for tamper-resistant
security, all within a 50 uW power budget. This unified approach not only
addresses power, security, and noise challenges but also enables scalable,
intelligent sensing for telemedicine and IoT applications.

Result: 仿真显示，该方法始终生成整数关联决策，总速率高于其他分数关联方法，尤其在大规模网络中表现更优。

Conclusion: GS-based GNN能高效解决整数关联约束问题，显著提升网络性能。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models can effectively optimize a multi-cell wireless
network by designing the beamforming vectors and association decisions.
Existing ML designs, however, often needs to approximate the integer
association variables with a probability distribution output. We propose a
novel graph neural network (GNN) structure that jointly optimize beamforming
vectors and user association while guaranteeing association output as integers.
The integer association constraints are satisfied using the Gumbel-Softmax (GS)
reparameterization, without increasing computational complexity. Simulation
results demonstrate that our proposed GS-based GNN consistently achieves
integer association decisions and yields a higher sum-rate, especially when
generalized to larger networks, compared to all other fractional association
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外热成像技术因其非接触式测量血流和皮肤血液流动的特性受到关注，但目前对深层血管区域（如面部和颈部）缺乏标准化方法，且外部刺激可能有害。

Method: 通过同步热成像技术，对8名受试者的额头和下巴进行微小温度变化（约10mK）的测量。

Result: 该方法将温度分辨率提高了2倍以上，能够稳定测量由血流引起的皮肤温度变化。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于生理感知，如监测因受伤或疾病引起的血流变化，或作为压力指标。

Abstract: Infrared thermography has gained interest as a tool for non-contact
measurement of blood circulation and skin blood flow due to cardiac activity.
Partiularly, blood vessels on the surface, such as on the back of the hand, are
suited for visualization. However, standardized methodologies have not yet been
established for areas such as the face and neck, where many blood vessels are
lie deeper beneath the surface, and external stimulation for measurement could
be harmful. Here we propose Synchro-Thermography for stable monitoring of
facial temperature changes associated with heart rate variability. We conducted
experiments with eight subjects and measured minute temperature changes with an
amplitude of about \SI{10}{mK} on the forehead and chin. The proposed method
improves the temperature resolution by a factor of 2 or more, and can stably
measure skin temperature changes caused by blood flow. This skin temperature
change could be applied to physiological sensing such as blood flow changes due
to injury or disease, or as an indicator of stress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的插值和修复方法缺乏环境感知能力，而许多深度学习方法依赖于详细场景数据，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出MARS方法，结合CNNs和Transformers，通过多尺度特征融合和残差连接提取全局和局部特征。

Result: 实验表明MARS在MSE和SSIM上优于基线模型，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: MARS具有强实用性，适用于不同场景和天线位置。

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Conclusion: 论文展示了基于物理方法和拓扑分析的TWR HAR任务可行性，并开源了相关代码。

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

Abstract: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge
nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached
at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit
percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this
letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based
on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our
simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit
percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Abstract: Indoor environments present a significant challenge for wireless
connectivity, as immense data demand strains traditional solutions. Public
Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), utilizing outdoor macro base stations (BSs),
suffer from poor signal penetration. Indoor Wi-Fi networks, on the other hand,
may face reliability issues due to spectrum contention. Shared spectrum models,
particularly the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) utilized by private
4G/5G networks, have emerged as a promising alternative to provide reliable
indoor service. Moreover, these private networks are equipped with the
neutral-host (NH) model, seamlessly offloading indoor MNOs' traffic to the
private CBRS network. This paper presents a comprehensive, in-situ performance
evaluation of three co-located technologies utilizing mid-bands spectrum (1-6
GHz)--a CBRS-based NH network, public MNO macro networks, and a Wi-Fi 6
network--within a large, big-box retail store characterized by significant
building loss. Our analysis demonstrates: (i) the NH network provides superior
indoor coverage compared to MNO macro, requiring only six CBRS devices
(CBSDs)--versus 65 Access Points (APs) for enterprise Wi-Fi--to achieve full
coverage, with a median building loss of 26.6 dB ensuring interference-free
coexistence with outdoor federal incumbents; (ii) the NH network achieves
substantial indoor throughput gains, with per-channel normalized throughput
improvements of 1.44x and 1.62x in downlink (DL), and 4.33x and 13x in uplink
(UL), compared to 4G and 5G macro deployments, respectively; (iii) the NH
deployment achieves a median indoor aggregated physical (PHY)-layer DL
throughput gain of 2.08x over 5G macro deployments indoors, despite utilizing
only 40 MHz of aggregated bandwidth compared to 225 MHz for 5G macro; and (iv)
the NH deployment also outperforms Wi-Fi in application-layer HTTP DL
performance by 5.05x.

*Xiaodan Shao,Qijun Jiang,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Naofal Al-Dhahir*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种新型偏振六维可动天线（P-6DMA），通过联合优化偏振和天线旋转，显著提升无线通信性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信中，传统天线在多样性和信道重构方面存在局限性，亟需一种经济高效的新方法。

Method: 建模P-6DMA信道，提出基于统计和瞬时信道状态信息的两阶段传输协议，采用罚对偶分解算法联合设计偏振和旋转。

Result: 仿真表明，偏振、天线旋转及其联合设计在性能上优于传统方案。

Conclusion: P-6DMA通过联合优化，为无线通信提供了高效且低复杂度的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel polarized six-dimensional movable antenna
(P-6DMA) to enhance the performance of wireless communication cost-effectively.
Specifically, the P-6DMA enables polarforming by adaptively tuning the
antenna's polarization electrically as well as controls the antenna's rotation
mechanically, thereby exploiting both polarization and spatial diversity to
reconfigure wireless channels for improving communication performance. First,
we model the P-6DMA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming
vectors and antenna rotations. We then propose a new two-timescale transmission
protocol to maximize the weighted sum-rate for a P-6DMA-enhanced multiuser
system. Specifically, antenna rotations at the base station (BS) are first
optimized based on the statistical channel state information (CSI) of all
users, which varies at a much slower rate compared to their instantaneous CSI.
Then, transceiver polarforming vectors are designed to cater to the
instantaneous CSI under the optimized BS antennas' rotations. Under the
polarforming phase shift and amplitude constraints, a new polarforming and
rotation joint design problem is efficiently addressed by a low-complexity
algorithm based on penalty dual decomposition, where the polarforming
coefficients are updated in parallel to reduce computational time. Simulation
results demonstrate the significant performance advantages of polarforming,
antenna rotation, and their joint design in comparison with various benchmarks
without polarforming or antenna rotation adaptation.

*Symeon Vaidanis,Photios A. Stavrou,Marios Kountouris*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一个面向目标的语义网络资源分配框架，考虑代理的主观感知和累积前景理论偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统资源分配通常基于预期效用理论，但现实中代理的决策可能偏离EUT。

Method: 结合累积前景理论（CPT）和人类决策行为（如风险感知、损失厌恶），开发了一个分析框架。

Result: 通过多信道无线通信系统的功率分配问题验证了框架的实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为考虑人类主观偏好的资源分配提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce a resource allocation framework for goal-oriented semantic
networks, where participating agents assess system quality through subjective
(e.g., context-dependent) perceptions. To accommodate this, our model accounts
for agents whose preferences deviate from traditional expected utility theory
(EUT), specifically incorporating cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences.
We develop a comprehensive analytical framework that captures human-centric
aspects of decision-making and risky choices under uncertainty, such as risk
perception, loss aversion, and perceptual distortions in probability metrics.
By identifying essential modifications in traditional resource allocation
design principles required for agents with CPT preferences, we showcase the
framework's relevance through its application to the problem of power
allocation in multi-channel wireless communication systems.

Motivation: 解决语义通信中资源分配的非凸非光滑优化问题，同时考虑主观风险感知和效用最大化。

Result: 提出了一种可高效解决复杂优化问题的方法，兼具理论严谨性和实际有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为语义感知资源分配提供了理论和实践上的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The problem of resource allocation in goal-oriented semantic communication
with semantic-aware utilities and subjective risk perception is studied here.
By linking information importance to risk aversion, we model agent behavior
using Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), which incorporates risk-sensitive
utility functions and nonlinear transformations of distributions, reflecting
subjective perceptions of gains and losses. The objective is to maximize the
aggregate utility across multiple CPT-modeled agents, which leads to a
nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problem. To efficiently solve this
challenging problem, we propose a new algorithmic framework that combines
successive convex approximation (SCA) with the projected subgradient method and
Lagrangian relaxation, Our approach enables tractable optimization while
preserving solution quality, offering both theoretical rigor and practical
effectiveness in semantics-aware resource allocation.

TL;DR: CSI2Vec是一种自监督框架，通过生成通用的CSI向量表示，用于无线定位和信道图绘制，具有低复杂性和高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Word2Vec启发，作者希望利用类似的技术捕捉无线信道状态信息（CSI）的空间关系，用于定位和信道图绘制。

Method: 使用神经网络在不同部署和无线电设置下训练，生成紧凑的CSI向量嵌入，避免完整CSI传输或重建。

Result: 仿真和真实数据实验显示，CSI2Vec在降低计算和存储需求的同时，保持了优异的定位和信道图绘制性能。

Conclusion: CSI2Vec是一种高效且通用的CSI表示方法，适用于多样化的无线场景，简化了后续任务的处理。

Abstract: Natural language processing techniques, such as Word2Vec, have demonstrated
exceptional capabilities in capturing semantic and syntactic relationships of
text through vector embeddings. Inspired by this technique, we propose CSI2Vec,
a self-supervised framework for generating universal and robust channel state
information (CSI) representations tailored to CSI-based positioning (POS) and
channel charting (CC). CSI2Vec learns compact vector embeddings across various
wireless scenarios, capturing spatial relationships between user equipment
positions without relying on CSI reconstruction or ground-truth position
information. We implement CSI2Vec as a neural network that is trained across
various deployment setups (i.e., the spatial arrangement of radio equipment and
scatterers) and radio setups (RSs) (i.e., the specific hardware used), ensuring
robustness to aspects such as differences in the environment, the number of
used antennas, or allocated set of subcarriers. CSI2Vec abstracts the RS by
generating compact vector embeddings that capture essential spatial
information, avoiding the need for full CSI transmission or reconstruction
while also reducing complexity and improving processing efficiency of
downstream tasks. Simulations with ray-tracing and real-world CSI datasets
demonstrate CSI2Vec's effectiveness in maintaining excellent POS and CC
performance while reducing computational demands and storage.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的内存构造方法，用于表示和重复利用阻抗计算，适用于具有多级块Toeplitz结构的阵列天线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于阵列天线的几何结构常具有部分平移对称性，传统方法在计算阻抗矩阵时内存消耗高（$\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$），需要更高效的算法。

Method: 基于九种电连接组件的组装方法，利用多级块Toeplitz结构矩阵，结合内部开发的逆求解器进行快速计算。

Result: 在32x32阵列的远场计算和两个紧密耦合的9x9阵列的散射参数测试中，内存需求降至$\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了内存消耗，提升了计算效率，适用于电连接阵列天线的大规模计算。

Abstract: A large part of the geometry of array antennas is often partially defined by
finite translational symmetries. Applying the method of moments (MoM) with the
RWG-like element on an appropriately structured mesh to these arrays results in
an impedance matrix where the main part exhibits a multilevel block Toeplitz
structure. This article introduces a memory-efficient construction method that
effectively represents and reuses impedance calculations. The proposed method,
applicable to electrically connected elements, also accounts for all
non-symmetric parts of the array. The core idea involves nine distinct
electrically connectable components from which the array can be assembled. The
derived multilevel block Toeplitz matrix is further utilized by an in-house
inverse solver to achieve faster and more memory-efficient MoM current vector
calculations. We demonstrate the method by computing the far-field of a 32x32
array and the scattering parameters of two tightly coupled 9x9 arrays. This
approach reduces the memory allocation from $\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$, for an $N_x \times N_y$ array.
