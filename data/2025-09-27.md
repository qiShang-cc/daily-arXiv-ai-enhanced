*Weijian Zhang,Hashan K. Weerasooriya,Prateek Chennuri,Stanley H. Chan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的非顺序马尔可夫模型，用于解决SP-LiDAR中时间戳分布的建模问题，通过重新参数化积分界限和分离死区时间效应，实现了高效计算，速度提升高达1000倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步单光子LiDAR（SP-LiDAR）在高精度3D应用和导航中非常重要，但其时间戳分布在存在死区时间的情况下的建模是一个极具挑战性的问题。

Method: 论文提出了一种非顺序马尔可夫模型，通过重新参数化积分界限和将死区时间效应作为基础矩阵的确定性行置换分离，实现了高效的矩阵构造和计算。

Result: 新模型在计算速度上比现有方法快1000倍，且与蒙特卡洛模拟的标准结果几乎完全一致。此外，理论分析揭示了第二大特征值的幅值和相位对收敛的关键影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为SP-LiDAR的时间戳分布建模提供了一种高效且准确的方法，显著提升了计算效率，并为相关理论分析提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Asynchronous single-photon LiDAR (SP-LiDAR) is an important imaging modality
for high-quality 3D applications and navigation, but the modeling of the
timestamp distributions of a SP-LiDAR in the presence of dead time remains a
very challenging open problem. Prior works have shown that timestamps form a
discrete-time Markov chain, whose stationary distribution can be computed as
the leading left eigenvector of a large transition matrix. However,
constructing this matrix is known to be computationally expensive because of
the coupling between states and the dead time. This paper presents the first
non-sequential Markov modeling for the timestamp distribution. The key
innovation is an equivalent formulation that reparameterizes the integral
bounds and separates the effect of dead time as a deterministic row permutation
of a base matrix. This decoupling enables efficient vectorized matrix
construction, yielding up to $1000 \times$ acceleration over existing methods.
The new model produces a nearly exact stationary distribution when compared
with the gold standard Monte Carlo simulations, yet using a fraction of the
time. In addition, a new theoretical analysis reveals the impact of the
magnitude and phase of the second-largest eigenvalue, which are overlooked in
the literature but are critical to the convergence.

### [2] [Wireless Powered MEC Systems via Discrete Pinching Antennas: TDMA versus NOMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20908)
*Peng Liu,Zesong Fei,Meng Hua,Guangji Chen,Xinyi Wang,Ruiqi Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Pinching antennas（PAs）作为一种新型可重构灵活天线结构，被应用于无线供电移动边缘计算（MEC）系统中提升能量传输和任务卸载效率。与传统理想假设不同，本文研究了离散PA辅助的实际系统，通过联合优化最大化计算比特数，并提出双层算法解决问题。结果表明，TDMA和NOMA在不同PA激活粒度下性能各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pinching antennas（PAs）因其独特的线视链路能力和减少路径损耗的潜力，为无线供电MEC系统提供了增强能量传输和任务卸载效率的可能性。

Method: 本研究提出了一种离散PA辅助的无线供电MEC框架，结合部分卸载模式，并通过封闭解和交叉熵学习的两层算法优化问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，TDMA和NOMA在粗糙PA激活粒度下性能相近，而精细粒度下TDMA优于NOMA。

Conclusion: 离散PA辅助MEC系统在优化设计和灵活激活策略下能显著提升性能，TDMA在精细粒度下更具优势。

Abstract: Pinching antennas (PAs), a new type of reconfigurable and flexible antenna
structures, have recently attracted significant research interest due to their
ability to create line-of-sight links and mitigate large-scale path loss. Owing
to their potential benefits, integrating PAs into wireless powered mobile edge
computing (MEC) systems is regarded as a viable solution to enhance both energy
transfer and task offloading efficiency. Unlike prior studies that assume ideal
continuous PA placement along waveguides, this paper investigates a practical
discrete PA-assisted wireless powered MEC framework, where devices first
harvest energy from PA-emitted radio-frequency signals and then adopt a partial
offloading mode, allocating part of the harvested energy to local computing and
the remainder to uplink offloading. The uplink phase considers both the
time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),
each examined under three levels of PA activation flexibility. For each
configuration, we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the total
computational bits and conduct a theoretical performance comparison between the
TDMA and NOMA schemes. To address the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear
problems, we develop a two-layer algorithm that combines closed-form solutions
based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with a cross-entropy-based
learning method. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed
design in terms of the harvested energy and computation performance, revealing
that TDMA and NOMA achieve comparable performance under coarser PA activation
levels, whereas finer activation granularity enables TDMA to achieve superior
computation performance over NOMA.

### [3] [A General Optimization Framework for Movable Antenna Systems via Discrete Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20987)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动天线系统能够通过局部天线移动重塑无线信道，但现有优化方法因计算复杂度高或易陷入局部最优而表现不佳。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为移动天线系统提供了一种高效且性能优异的优化方案。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) systems have attracted growing interest in wireless
communications due to their ability to reshape wireless channels via local
antenna movement within a confined region. However, optimizing antenna
positions to enhance communication performance turns out to be challenging due
to the highly nonlinear relationship between wireless channels and antenna
positions. Existing approaches, such as gradient-based and heuristic
algorithms, often suffer from high computational complexity or undesired local
optima. To address the above challenge, this letter proposes a general and
low-complexity optimization framework for MA position optimization.
Specifically, we discretize the antenna movement region into a set of sampling
points, thereby transforming the continuous optimization problem into a
discrete point selection problem. Next, we sequentially update the optimal
sampling point for each MA over multiple rounds. To avoid convergence to poor
local optima, a Gibbs sampling (GS) phase is introduced between rounds to
explore adjacent and randomly generated candidate solutions. As a case study,
we investigate joint precoding and antenna position optimization for an
MA-enhanced broadcast system by applying the proposed framework. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal
performance and significantly outperforms existing benchmarks.

### [4] [Shapley Features for Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21032)
*Mohammad Ali Vahedifar,Qi Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合高斯过程(GP)和ResNet神经网络的新型预测框架，并通过Shapley特征值(SFV)优化性能，显著提高了触觉信号传输的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉互联网(TI)需要超低延迟和可靠的触觉信号传输，但包丢失和延迟问题尚未解决。本文旨在提出一种高精度和高效率的解决方案。

Method: 结合高斯过程(GP)和基于ResNet的神经网络，GP用于恢复丢失或延迟的信号。引入Shapley特征值(SFV)进行特征选择，优化性能。

Result: GP+SFV框架实现了95.72%的准确率，比现有LeFo方法提升11.1%，同时降低了TI的延迟约束。SFV还能显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GP+SFV框架为TI系统提供了高精度和高效率的触觉通信解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and reliable haptic
signal transmission, yet packet loss and delay remain unresolved challenges. We
present a novel prediction framework that integrates Gaussian Processes (GP)
with a ResNet-based Neural Network, where GP acts as an oracle to recover
signals lost or heavily delayed. To further optimize performance, we introduce
Shapley Feature Values (SFV), a principled feature selection mechanism that
isolates the most informative inputs for prediction. This GP+SFV framework
achieves 95.72% accuracy, surpassing the state-of-the-art LeFo method by 11.1%,
while simultaneously relaxing TI's rigid delay constraints. Beyond accuracy,
SFV operates as a modular accelerator: when paired with LeFo, it reduces
inference time by 27%, and when paired with GP, by 72%. These results establish
GP+SFV as both a high-accuracy and high-efficiency solution, paving the way for
practical and reliable haptic communications in TI systems.

### [5] [Neural Integrated Sensing and Communication for the MIMO-OFDM Downlink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21118)
*Ziyi Wang,Frederik Zumegen,Christoph Studer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经网络的ISAC信号处理框架，利用MIMO-OFDM下行链路实现通用化感知功能，无需修改现有通信链路，并通过多分类或多标签分类生成空间占用图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线感知和通信应用在频谱和硬件需求上的趋同促使了下一代网络中的ISAC范式发展。论文旨在通过数据驱动学习技术增强现有通信基础设施的感知能力。

Method: 采用MIMO-OFDM下行链路的信号处理框架，通过测量反射通信信号生成空间占用图，设计特定特征以减少强反射路径的干扰。

Result: 大量模拟显示，框架能可靠重建场景地图，且不影响MIMO-OFDM通信链路或降低数据传输速率。

Conclusion: 神经ISAC框架为下一代网络中的集成感知与通信提供了高效且无需修改现有通信系统的解决方案。

Abstract: The ongoing convergence of spectrum and hardware requirements for wireless
sensing and communication applications has fueled the integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) paradigm in next-generation networks. Neural-network-based
ISAC leverages data-driven learning techniques to add sensing capabilities to
existing communication infrastructure. This paper presents a novel
signal-processing framework for such neural ISAC systems based on the
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) downlink. Our approach enables generalized sensing
functionality without modifying the MIMO-OFDM communication link. Specifically,
our neural ISAC pipeline measures the backscattered communication signals to
generate discrete map representations of spatial occupancy, formulated as
multiclass or multilabel classification problems, which can then be utilized by
specialized downstream tasks. To improve sensing performance in closed or
cluttered environments, our neural ISAC pipeline relies on features
specifically designed to mitigate strong reflective paths. Extensive
simulations using ray-tracing models demonstrate that our neural ISAC framework
reliably reconstructs scene maps without altering the MIMO-OFDM communication
pipeline or reducing data rates.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的框架，用于提升集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统的安全性、数据率和感知性能，通过随机频率和脉冲重复间隔（PRI）敏捷性（RFPA）方法设计波形，并通过混合信息嵌入方案提高数据吞吐量。

Method: 采用RFPA方法设计波形，结合ASK、PSK、IM和SM的混合信息嵌入方案，并提出低复杂度的稀疏匹配滤波器接收器。

Result: 分析显示所提波形具有出色的距离-速度分辨率和杂波抑制能力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著增强了ISAC系统的安全性和性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing the security, data rate,
and sensing performance of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)
systems. We employ a random frequency and pulse repetition interval (PRI)
agility (RFPA) method for the waveform design, where the necessary random
sequences are governed by shared secrets. These secrets, which can be
pre-shared or generated via channel reciprocity, obfuscate critical radar
parameters like Doppler frequency and pulse start times, thereby significantly
impeding the ability to perform reconnaissance from a passive adversary without
the secret key. To further introduce enhanced data throughput, we also
introduce a hybrid information embedding scheme that integrates amplitude shift
keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), index modulation (IM), and spatial
modulation (SM), for which a low-complexity sparse-matched filter receiver is
proposed for accurate decoding with practical complexity. Finally, the
excellent range-velocity resolution and clutter suppression of the proposed
waveform are analyzed via the ambiguity function (AF).

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对非平稳MIMO无线信道的对抗性鲁棒物理层认证框架，结合了贝叶斯决策、对比学习和生成对抗建模，显著提升了认证鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设信道平稳或观测独立，无法应对时空相关性、视线阻塞和动态欺骗策略，因此需要一种更鲁棒的认证框架。

Method: 整合了序列贝叶斯决策、对比学习深层特征提取和生成对抗建模，并利用2态和3态隐马尔可夫模型进行性能分析。

Result: 通过封闭式递归计算对数似然比和检测概率，证明了该方法在鲁棒性上显著优于传统序列认证方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为非平稳MIMO信道提供了一种高效且鲁棒的认证解决方案，适用于动态无线环境。

Abstract: We propose an adversarially robust physical layer authentication (AR-PLA)
framework tailored for non-stationary multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
wireless channels. The framework integrates sequential Bayesian
decision-making, deep feature extraction via contrastive learning, and
generative adversarial modeling to simulate adaptive spoofers. Unlike
conventional methods that assume stationary channels or independent
observations, our approach explicitly accounts for temporal and spatial
correlations, line-of-sight (LoS) blockages, and dynamic spoofing strategies. A
comprehensive analytical characterization of the authentication performance
using both 2-state and 3-state hidden Markov models (HMMs) with moving-average
online adaptation is also provided, with closed-form recursions for
loglikelihood ratios, detection probabilities, and steady-state approximations,
which demonstrate significant robustness improvement over classical sequential
authentication schemes.

Conclusion: 改进的距离评估算法结合加权KNN分类器在轴承故障诊断中表现优异，适用于噪声环境。

Abstract: Bearings are among the most failure-prone components in rotating machinery,
and their condition directly impacts overall performance. Therefore, accurately
diagnosing bearing faults is essential for ensuring system stability. However,
detecting such malfunctions in noisy environments, where data is collected from
multiple sensors, necessitates the extraction and selection of informative
features. This paper proposes an improved distance evaluation algorithm
combined with a weighted K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for bearing fault
diagnosis. The process begins with extracting and integrating statistical
features of vibration across the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains.
Next, the improved distance evaluation algorithm assigns weights to the
extracted features, retaining only the most informative ones by eliminating
insensitive features. Finally, the selected features are used to train the
weighted KNN classifier. To validate the proposed method, we employ bearing
data from the University of Ottawa. The results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in accurately identifying bearing faults.

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋应用的快速发展（如水下监视和矿物勘探）需要实时无线回传大量观测数据，但窄带声学方法难以满足需求，而水-空气光无线通信（OWC）因波动界面导致的信号折射动态变化带来了挑战。

Method: 建立了水-空气光无线传输的数学信道模型，并提出一种基于视觉的光束跟踪算法，结合CNN、Bi-LSTM和注意力机制，动态预测并优化信道。

Abstract: The escalating development of oceanic applications like underwater
surveillance and mineral exploration, is motivating real-time wireless backhaul
of the considerable observation data. Such prospects can be hardly realized by
the narrowband acoustic approach. Alternatively, optical wireless communication
(OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for maritime and underwater
applications due to its great potential for broadband underwater transmission.
However, the implementations of water-air OWC can be rather challenging,
especially when penetrating the fluctuating interface, where the direction of
refracted signals changes dynamically, causing severe beam misalignment with
airborne stations. This has necessitated real-time transceiver alignment
adaptable to the sophisticated oceanic environment, which has yet to be
addressed. Against this background, this paper establishes a mathematical
channel model for water-air optical wireless transmission across the
fluctuating sea surface. Based on the model, we propose a vision-based beam
tracking algorithm that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) methods for
dynamic channel prediction. The proposed algorithm integrates a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM),
which further incorporates the attention mechanism to effectively extract
critical spatio-temporal features from the vision data. The numerical
simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform its
classical counterparts in maintaining receiving signal strength and supressing
the vision noises, which demonstrates its robustness against the the harsh
conditions of water-air OWC systems.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of sensor output uncertainty is important for
reliable data interpretation in many applications. Here, we investigate the
impact of transducer-level measurement uncertainty on overall sensor
measurement accuracy due to limited-precision information about sensor
components. We explain our method using thermopile-based sensors as an example
class of sensors. We show how sensor calibration and conversion equations,
which are an essential part of all sensing systems, propagate uncertainties
resulting from the quantization of calibration parameters, to the final,
compensated sensor output. The experimental results show that the epistemic
uncertainty of calibration-related quantities leads to absolute error in the
sensor output as high as 5.3 {\deg}C (and relative error as high as 25.7%) for
one commonly-used thermopile sensor. In one instance of using the epistemic
uncertainty information in edge detection, we show reduction of false-positives
edges to zero for the conventional Canny operator, while maintaining accuracy.
We show these ideas are practical and possible on actual embedded sensor
systems by prototyping them on two commercially-available uncertainty tracking
hardware platforms, one with average power dissipation 16.7 mW and 42.9x
speedup compared to the equal-confidence Monte Carlo computation (the status
quo), and the other with average power dissipation 147.15 mW and 94.4x speedup,
paving the way for use in real time.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

not considered previously including a noticeable increase in adopting Formal
Synthesis approaches as well as Probabilistic Verification Techniques.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The elephant trunk exemplifies a natural gripper where structure, actuation,
and sensing are seamlessly integrated. Inspired by the distal morphology of the
African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种感知-动作框架，解决四足机器人在单腿推挤物体时因遮挡而导致的状态估计问题，通过交互感知状态估计回路提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集杂乱环境中，机器人需要安全地与障碍物交互以清理路径，但单腿推挤等动作可能导致物体在操作中被遮挡，难以预测其状态。

Method: 提出了一种紧密耦合的感知-动作框架，利用本体反馈预测被遮挡物体的位移，并在交互后重新检测物体，形成闭环感知-动作回路。

Result: 在波士顿动力Spot机器人上实现的实验表明，该方法比开环基线在楼梯推挤任务中取得了更高的成功率和跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 交互感知的状态估计方法能有效解决遮挡问题，提升机器人在复杂环境中的操作能力。

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

*Anujith Muraleedharan,Anamika J H*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARQ是一种基于学习进度的查询策略，仅在学习停滞或恶化时请求反馈，从而减少不必要的反馈请求，提高机器人学习的效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中人类反馈成本高且有限，现有HiL-RL方法假设反馈充足，限制了其在物理机器人部署中的实用性。

Method: 提出SPARQ策略，通过在学习停滞或恶化时请求反馈，减少不必要的反馈调用。在模拟UR5拾取任务中对比无反馈、随机查询和始终查询三种基线方法。

Result: SPARQ实现近乎完美的任务成功率，与始终查询相当，但仅消耗约一半的反馈预算。相比随机查询，学习更稳定高效，且显著优于无反馈训练。

Conclusion: 基于学习进度的选择性查询策略可使HiL-RL在现实约束下更高效、可扩展。

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

Conclusion: GraspFactory数据集为机器人抓取模型的训练提供了丰富的数据支持，有助于提升模型的泛化性能

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot
Operating System (ROS), processing real-time sensor data to update
probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous
environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid response to marine
pollution incidents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种推理时潜在激活编辑框架（LAE），通过修改预训练策略的激活而非权重或架构，提升多无人机导航中的安全性，显著减少碰撞。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在多无人机协调与导航中取得了进展，但在障碍物密集环境中，预训练策略仍易发生碰撞。直接重新训练或微调成本高且可能损害已有技能。

Method: LAE框架包含两部分：（1）在线分类器监测中间激活以检测不良行为状态；（2）激活编辑模块选择性修改激活以导向更安全的行为。具体通过潜在碰撞世界模型预测未来预碰撞激活。

Result: 实验表明，LAE显著减少了近90%的累计碰撞，同时保持任务完成率，适用于资源受限的硬件。

Conclusion: LAE是一种轻量级范式，可用于部署后优化学习到的机器人策略，提升安全性而不需修改原始策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

Conclusion: 非仿生设计不仅能降低数据收集门槛，还能实现传统双手任务的一手完成。

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

Conclusion: 该触觉共享控制框架有效促进了高级驾驶技能的学习，优于传统方法。

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

Motivation: 现有脑机接口（BCI）控制机器人系统存在信号噪声大、灵活性差及缺乏闭环验证等问题，限制了实际应用。该研究旨在通过集成多种技术提升BCI系统的稳定性和实用性。

Method: 结合运动想象（MI）EEG解码、AR神经反馈和机器人视觉抓取技术，开发闭环系统。实验验证了MI训练、AR反馈和闭环抓取的效果。

Result: 系统表现优异：MI训练准确率93.1%，AR反馈显著提升控制稳定性（SCI=0.210），闭环抓取成功率97.2%。

Conclusion: AR反馈显著提升EEG控制稳定性，闭环系统为零接触抓取提供了可靠解决方案，为辅助机器人应用和人机交互开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing
assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

Conclusion: RAM-NAS填补了NAS在机器人硬件资源意识方面的空白，并在下游任务中验证了方法的可扩展性。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

Conclusion: RuN框架有效解决了人形机器人步态控制问题，提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出BIM2RDT框架，通过AI将静态BIM转化为动态机器人可用数字孪生，整合多源数据并提升施工安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 施工行业数字化管理需求迫切，需要连接设计模型、实时工地感知和自主操作的系统以提高效率和安全性。

Method: 引入Semantic-Gravity ICP算法，结合大型语言模型推理优化点云配准，并整合YOLOE目标检测和实时振动监测。

Result: SG-ICP算法在特征遮挡场景下对齐误差降低64.3%-88.3%，实时振动监测提升ISO 5349-1合规性。

Conclusion: BIM2RDT框架通过动态数字孪生和多源数据整合，显著提升施工安全性和机器人操作效率。

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖框架，将自然语言指令与BIM语义图结合，通过Beta-Bernoulli贝叶斯融合方法改进机器人路径规划的鲁棒性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，将自然语言提示融入机器人任务规划引发了广泛关注，尤其是在建筑领域，BIM模型提供了丰富的环境描述。论文旨在通过融合自然语言指令与BIM语义图，提升路径规划的上下文感知能力。

Method: 提出了一种Beta-Bernoulli贝叶斯融合框架，将LLM输出的危险分数作为伪计数更新Beta分布的参数，生成连续的上下文感知排斥增益，增强基于欧氏距离的势场启发式。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在路径鲁棒性和有效性上均取得了定性和定量的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数值稳定的方式，能够处理多自然语言指令，并在任何学习或经典AI框架中灵活集成。

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

TL;DR: Residual joint targets framework（RobotDancing）可零样本迁移至硬件，实现高动态运动跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人长期高动态运动跟踪中的误差累积问题，弥补模型与实际的动力学差异。

Method: 提出RobotDancing框架，利用单阶段强化学习预测残余关节目标，端到端训练并通过sim-to-sim和零样本sim-to-real验证。

Result: 在Unitree G1和H1/H1-2上验证，能够跟踪多分钟高能量行为（如跳跃、旋转、侧手翻），并在硬件上实现高质量运动跟踪。

Conclusion: RobotDancing框架简单可扩展，能有效解决动态运动跟踪问题，支持零样本硬件部署。

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉与语义的导航框架，取代传统SLAM的几何密集表示，通过层次化的视觉-语言感知和语义-概率拓扑地图，实现更鲁棒的语义导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM在快速运动、标定需求和传感器漂移下表现脆弱，且缺乏任务驱动的语义推理能力。

Method: 采用视觉语言感知模块融合场景和物体信息，结合语义-概率拓扑图进行从粗到细的规划（LLM全局推理和局部避障）。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中提升了语义准确性、规划质量和导航成功率。

Conclusion: 该框架为语义驱动导航提供了新范式，从几何为中心转向语义决策。

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

Motivation: 传统的视觉SLAM系统在低纹理环境和挑战性视觉条件下表现不佳，而现有的基于神经网络的点图回归方法通常忽略了概率多传感器信息融合的优势。

Method: 提出了MASt3R-Fusion框架，引入Sim(3)视觉对齐约束到SE(3)因子图中，设计了分层因子图，支持实时滑动窗口优化和全局优化。

Result: 在公共和自采集数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于现有视觉中心的多传感器SLAM系统。

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion通过多传感器信息融合，提升了视觉SLAM的性能，代码开源以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Conclusion: 结合行为共享和自适应探索策略可以显著提升多任务强化学习在机器人领域的实用性。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple
tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to
robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task
data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that
enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing
across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight.
MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration
towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on
task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage,
even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that
MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported
by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight
the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing
with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality
of MTRL in robotics applications.

TL;DR: SemSight是一种用于多层次场景语义的鸟瞰图预测模型，通过联合推断结构布局、全局场景上下文和目标区域分布，提升了未知区域的语义预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标驱动导航和自主探索中，对未知区域的合理预测至关重要，现有方法大多局限于单一对象或几何占用地图，缺乏建模房间级语义结构的能力。

Method: 提出SemSight模型，采用编码器-解码器网络架构，引入掩码约束监督策略，仅在未知区域进行监督。训练基于2,000个室内布局图生成的40,000个序列化观测数据集。

Result: 实验表明，SemSight在未知区域的关键功能类别预测中表现更优，在结构一致性（SC）和区域识别准确率（PA）等指标上超越非掩码监督方法，并提升了导航效率。

Conclusion: SemSight有效地提升了未知区域的语义预测能力，在导航和场景理解中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

Result: 实验表明，CoMOK方法在多阶段任务、多模态机器人行为和可变形物体处理上表现优异。

Conclusion: CoMOK为端到端机器人操作策略提供了一种通用、准确且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: MTRDrive展示了提升自动驾驶系统安全性和可靠性的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen
scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight
MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more
reliable systems.

Conclusion: 接触模型的设计对可微分模拟器的梯度行为至关重要，提出的模型在计算效率和梯度稳定性上表现优异。

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

Result: 在NAVSIM数据集上达到自回归模型中最高的89.8 PDMS。

Conclusion: TISA模块和多目标后训练显著提升了自动驾驶规划的准确性和可行性。

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

Abstract: We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor

user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task
graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic
mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then
selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For
interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick
and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual
context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs
fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception
and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining
real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static
scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$
overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By
combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system
inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task
generalization of language-conditioned manipulation.

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision
Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with
reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path
length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes
shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2:
$0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$
($0.064\rightarrow0.034\,\mathrm{m}^3$). These results highlight improved
autonomy, precision, and safety for multi-robot EV battery disassembly in
unstructured, dynamic environments.

TL;DR: KeyWorld框架通过专注于语义关键帧来提升文本条件机器人世界模型的效率，同时保持生成轨迹的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的帧到帧生成方法存在计算冗余和忽略关键语义过渡的问题，限制了机器人世界模型的实际应用。

Method: KeyWorld通过简化运动轨迹识别关键帧，使用DiT模型生成关键帧，并用轻量级插值器填充中间帧。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，KeyWorld实现了5.68倍的加速，并提升了生成视频的物理有效性。

Conclusion: KeyWorld为实时机器人控制等需要高效有效世界模型的领域提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Conclusion: 该研究为卫星对接提供了更高效且抗干扰的解决方案，有助于轨道加油与服务任务。

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a
partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to
fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting
stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and
Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive
capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The
proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar
stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with
fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves
superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort,
outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances
fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the
feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Conclusion: Normalizing Flows Policy在性能和效率上优于扩散模型，并通过消融研究验证了关键架构和训练技术的有效性。

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient
inference process. Through comprehensive experiments across four distinct
simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this
domain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无人机边缘检测方法成本高、计算需求大的问题，充分利用地面效应作为新感知模式。

Method: 通过分析无人机基本姿态传感器读数和飞行指令，检测地面效应变化，实现边缘检测。

Result: 系统检测准确率高，平均距离误差0.051米，比基线方法提升86%，功耗仅43毫瓦。

Conclusion: AirTouch系统展示了地面效应作为一种低成本、高效边缘检测新方法的潜力。

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing
modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.

Motivation: 传统的机器人行为学习依赖物理演示，数据收集繁琐且难以扩展。论文旨在通过跨模态指令（如文本标注）替代物理运动，解决这一问题。

Method: 提出CrossInstruct框架，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）生成2D视图的多模态合成结果，并将其融合为3D运动轨迹分布。结合小模型进行细粒度控制，并通过强化学习优化策略。

Conclusion: CrossInstruct通过跨模态指令实现了机器人行为的广义生成，为数据驱动的机器人学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 研究表明全面的状态表征在学习系统中至关重要，增强感知可能提升控制器性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Motivation: 双机械臂抓取大型复杂物体时，稳定性、碰撞避免和泛化能力是关键挑战，现有方法通常依赖区域先验或启发式方法，缺乏系统性的稳定性保证。

Method: 提出DAGDiff，直接在SE(3) x SE(3)空间中通过扩散过程生成抓取对，整合几何、稳定性和碰撞感知的引导信号。

Result: DAGDiff在力闭合检查、碰撞分析和大规模物理仿真中表现优于现有方法，并能在真实点云上生成抓取对。

Conclusion: DAGDiff成功解决了双机械臂抓取的稳定性和泛化问题，适用于真实机器人系统。

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

Result: 在真实和模拟导航任务中，ReasonNav成功运用高级推理，在复杂建筑物中高效导航。

Conclusion: ReasonNav通过集成人类导航行为，显著提升了机器人在大型环境中的导航效率。

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived
detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a
methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed:
a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power
Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers
effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare
and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering
their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to
evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system,
highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis
in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design
omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical
insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research

Conclusion: SEEC框架显著提升了末端执行器的稳定性与适应性，为复杂动态环境提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: FSGlove通过开源硬件和软件设计，推动了手部追踪技术，弥合了人类灵活性与机器人模仿之间的差距。

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,
fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic
imitation. Evaluated against Nokov optical MoCap, FSGlove advances hand
tracking by unifying the kinematic and contact fidelity. Hardware design,

Method: 提出 RetoVLA，直接重用 Vision Transformers 中原本被丢弃的 Register Tokens，并将其注入 Action Expert。

Result: 在 7-DOF 机械臂上，RetoVLA 在复杂操作任务中的成功率提升了 17.1%。

Conclusion: 重用 Register Tokens 能够有效提升空间推理能力，证明这些原本被视为冗余的信息是未被充分利用的资源。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable
generalization in robotics but are restricted by their substantial size and
computational cost, limiting real-world deployment. However, conventional
lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic
intelligence. A video demonstration is available at:

Conclusion: BiNoMaP为非抓握操作提供了可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

Conclusion: GMP3结合DroneManager软件，为无人机路径规划提供了高效、可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in

Motivation: 现有运动生成模型常忽略生物力学研究中运动分类的层次结构信息，导致生成的运动与其底层结构脱节。

Result: 实验表明，GPHDM能准确编码运动分类和时间动态，生成新颖且物理一致的运动轨迹。

Conclusion: GPHDM成功解决了运动生成中层次结构和物理一致性的问题。

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

Motivation: 机器人需要有效存储和利用环境记忆来回答人类的空间查询，而现有的研究在记忆检索和整合方面仍有不足。

Method: Meta-Memory通过LLM构建高密度环境记忆表示，结合语义和空间模态进行联合推理。

Result: 在SpaceLocQA和NaVQA基准测试中，Meta-Memory显著优于现有方法，并在实际机器人平台上成功部署。

Conclusion: Meta-Memory为解决机器人环境记忆检索和整合问题提供了有效方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Motivation: 解决在共享网络物理系统仿真时，如何防止对手通过时间序列输出推断出底层的图形移位算子（GSO），同时确保合法分析的实用性。

Method: 通过建模分析师的观察为图滤波器的时间序列输出，并驱动差分隐私节点激励，研究如何通过输入端的差分隐私机制为GSO提供正式的隐私保证。

Result: 对于差分隐私的高斯信号，图滤波器和噪声协方差的频谱特性决定了隐私界限，平滑滤波器和条件数较低的协方差可提供更强隐私保护。

Conclusion: 研究表明，差分隐私机制可以有效保护GSO的隐私，其效果取决于滤波器和噪声协方差的频谱特性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from
privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system
simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series
outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal
excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift
operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we
study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from
identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show
that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for
the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of
the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals,
the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine
the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance
yielding greater privacy.

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型在逆向问题中的应用提供了理论基础，扩展了非凸模型集的全局收敛性。

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏奖励的多智能体强化学习中，现有好奇心机制无法区分环境随机性和有意义的新颖性，且忽略了同伴行为中包含的潜在任务动态，导致探索效率不足。

Method: 受人类儿童通过观察同伴校准探索行为的启发，CERMIC通过过滤噪声信号并动态调整好奇心，同时生成理论支持的内在奖励，鼓励探索高信息增益的状态转换。

Result: 在VMAS、Meltingpot和SMACv2等基准测试中，CERMIC显著优于现有算法。

Conclusion: CERMIC通过引入多智能体上下文校准内在好奇心，有效提升了稀疏奖励环境中的探索性能。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

Conclusion: 流体天线技术与无人机集成感知与通信系统的结合具有显著优势。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) is regarded as a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems.
However, conventional fixed antenna arrays limit the ability of UAVs to fully
exploit their inherent potential. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
UAV-enabled ISAC framework equipped with fluid antenna (FA) arrays, where the
mobility of antenna elements introduces additional spatial degrees of freedom
to simultaneously enhance communication and sensing performance. A
multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize the
communication rates of multiple users while minimizing the Cram\'er-Rao bound
(CRB) for single-target angle estimation. Due to excessively frequent updates
of FA positions may lead to response delays, a three-timescale optimization
framework is developed to jointly design transmit beamforming, FA positions,
and UAV trajectory based on their characteristics. To solve the non-convexity
of the problem, an alternating optimization-based algorithm is developed to
obtain a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme
significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, validating the
effectiveness of integrating the FA technology into the UAV-enabled ISAC
systems.

Result: RMC-SC码在循环计数和性能上显著优于传统方案，展示了优异的性能提升。

Conclusion: RMC-SC码为自适应编码设计提供了高效解决方案，适用于多种通信和存储场景。

Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they
offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components,
the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In
the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed.
For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions
and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger
codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables
switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while
reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable
SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design
probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is
achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes
memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of
short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability
distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown
distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the
gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of
cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to
design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other
cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC
codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts
and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a
literature-based straightforward scheme.

inherent imaging capabilities were evaluated and validated in flow phantom and
human CA experiments. In the phantom study, 3D/4D power Doppler image and
speckle-tracking analyses confirmed the system's ability to resolve flow

Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications
in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph
alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with
incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal,
language-aided framework for 3D scene graph alignment. Our method addresses the
challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across
heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling
accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By
employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++
enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D
reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40%
on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.

Conclusion: SceneWeaver为通用3D环境生成提供了新方向，推动了场景合成的进一步发展。

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.
