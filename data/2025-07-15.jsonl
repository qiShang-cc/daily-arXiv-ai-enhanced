To address training challenges under diverse\nand limited channel station information (CSI) conditions, a two-stage training\nprocess is introduced, which consists of an offline pre-training for robust\nfeature extraction using an auxiliary module, followed by online training of\nthe decoder with a composite loss function that ensures alignment between the\nsynthesized and target beam patterns in terms of the main lobe shape and side\nlobe suppression.

Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a method\nfor decomposing nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics into several basic dynamics\n(dynamic modes; DMs) with intrinsic frequencies and decay rates. In particular,\nunlike Fourier transform-based methods, which are used to decompose a\nsingle-channel signal into the amplitudes of sinusoidal waves with discrete\nfrequencies at a regular interval, DMD can derive the intrinsic frequencies of\na multichannel signal on the basis of the available data; furthermore, it can\ncapture nonstationary components such as alternations between states with\ndifferent intrinsic frequencies.

The distributions of DM frequencies in the\nelectroencephalograms of healthy subjects and patients with dementia or\nParkinson's disease in a resting state were evaluated.

By\nemploying the CS rather than the WSS model for processes that are inherently\ncorrelated across frequency, it is possible to improve the estimation of\ncross-power spectral densities (PSDs), source separation, and beamforming. We\nillustrate how the correlation between harmonic frequencies of CS processes can\nenhance system identification, and validate our findings using both simulated\nand real speech data."}

This paper presents a\ncomprehensive overview of the LP-WUS and LP-SS procedures in the RRC_IDLE and\nRRC_INACTIVE states, and outlines key physical layer design choices. The LP-WUS\nis designed to be detected by a low-power energy detector (ED), allowing the\nmain radio (MR) to remain switched off. This architecture enables power savings\nof up to 80% compared to conventional 5G paging mechanisms."}

However, practical FL deployments often face a key\nrealistic challenge: Clients participate intermittently in server aggregation\nand with unknown, possibly biased participation probabilities. Most existing\nconvergence results either assume full-device participation, or rely on\nknowledge of (in fact uniform) client availability distributions -- assumptions\nthat rarely hold in practice. In this work, we characterize the optimization\nproblem that consistently adheres to the stochastic dynamics of the well-known\n\\emph{agnostic Federated Averaging (FedAvg)} algorithm under random (and\nvariably-sized) client availability, and rigorously establish its convergence\nfor convex, possibly nonsmooth losses, achieving a standard rate of order\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the aggregation horizon. Our\nanalysis provides the first convergence guarantees for agnostic FedAvg under\ngeneral, non-uniform, stochastic client participation, without knowledge of the\nparticipation distribution. We also empirically demonstrate that agnostic\nFedAvg in fact outperforms common (and suboptimal) weighted aggregation FedAvg\nvariants, even with server-side knowledge of participation weights."}
