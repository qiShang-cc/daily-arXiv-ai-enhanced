Abstract: General requirements for radar digital signal processing are ionospheric
distortion and Doppler dispersion correction, which has historically required
radar-specific hardware to implement in real time. Although analog solutions
are computationally efficient, they often come with system design drawbacks
which limit waveform flexibility and can result in an overall increase of
system complexity. With improvements in modern general compute systems,
real-time digital signal processing is becoming more realizable using
non-radar-specific high-performance compute. In this paper, we present an
analysis of general Doppler and ionospheric correction algorithms for arbitrary
waveforms for radar digital signal processing. We also include considerations
for efficient implementation of these algorithms in software, specifically
using GPU hardware. This analysis includes metrics of performance such as
execution time and error correction accuracy. We also provide recommendations
for application in radar signal processing. We identify two algorithms for
dispersion correction: an FFT-based method for ionospheric dispersion and a
numerical interpolation method via sinc interpolation for Doppler dispersion.
Both of these algorithms are able to compensate for dispersion equivalent in
accuracy to waveform-specific analytical methods and were able to be performed
in real-time on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. These methods are waveform agnostic
and applied directly to the samples, improving system flexibility and making
them easy to incorporate into existing software-defined radio systems.

### [2] [Anti-Jamming Sensing with Distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04964)
*Zhaowei Wang,Yunsong Huang,Weicheng Liu,Hui-Ming Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用分布式可重构智能超表面天线（RIMSA）的RF传感方法，通过深度强化学习优化波束成形和信号映射，以提升恶劣环境下的传感精度和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RF传感方法在不可预测的无线电环境中受传播信道不良（如衰落和噪声）影响，精度下降，亟需新型方法提升性能。

Method: 部署多个RIMSA接收器，利用深度强化学习算法优化波束成形模式，并设计神经网络实现信号到传感结果的映射；同时提出联合损失函数以应对干扰。

Result: 仿真显示，分布式RIMSA系统比集中式实现传感效率更高，环境适应能力更强，且在干扰攻击下仍能保持高精度。

Conclusion: 分布式RIMSA结合DRL和抗干扰设计，显著提升了RF传感的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has
garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable
and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods
is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the
receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing
distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect
the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)
are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,
RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem
is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping
of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we
introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating
the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting
received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may
potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable
effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss
function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed
distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and
better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation.
Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance
even under jamming attack.

### [3] [Localized Kernel Methods for Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04978)
*Sippanon Kitimoon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本论文提出两种基于局部核的信号处理方法，用于噪声条件下的参数恢复，分别针对多维指数模型的频率和幅度估计以及线性调频信号的分离，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在低信噪比条件下传统方法（如MUSIC和ESPRIT）在频率和幅度估计中的不足，以及分离线性调频信号时面临的挑战，本论文提出了基于局部核的改进方法。

Method: 第一种方法使用局部三角多项式核检测多维频率，并通过坐标投影和配准提高恢复精度；第二种方法利用局部核构造SSO变体，通过FFT滤波和聚类分离线性调频信号。

Result: 在低信噪比下，第一种方法优于传统子空间算法；第二种方法能够在极低信噪比（-30 dB）下分离交叉和不连续的调频信号。

Conclusion: 两种方法均基于局部核和FFT实现，不依赖子空间分解或稀疏正则化，具有鲁棒性和高效性，未来可扩展至非线性调频信号和自适应核设计。

Abstract: This dissertation presents two signal processing methods using specially
designed localized kernels for parameter recovery under noisy condition. The
first method addresses the estimation of frequencies and amplitudes in
multidimensional exponential models. It utilizes localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels to detect the multivariate frequencies, followed by a more
detailed parameter estimation. We compare our method with MUSIC and ESPRIT,
which are classical subspace-based algorithms widely used for estimating the
parameters of exponential signals. In the univariate case, the method
outperforms MUSIC and ESPRIT under low signal-to-noise ratios. For the
multivariate case, we develop a coordinate-wise projection and registration
approach that achieves high recovery accuracy using significantly fewer samples
than other methods.
  The second method focuses on separating linear chirp components from
time-localized signal segments. A variant of the Signal Separation Operator
(SSO) is constructed using a localized kernel. Instantaneous frequency
estimates are obtained via FFT-based filtering, then clustered and fitted with
piecewise linear regression. The method operates without prior knowledge of the
number of components and is shown to recover intersecting and discontinuous
chirps at SNR levels as low as -30 dB.
  Both methods share an idea based on localized kernels and efficient FFT-based
implementation, and neither requires subspace decomposition or sparsity
regularization. Experimental results confirm the robustness and tractability of
the proposed approaches across a range of simulated data conditions. Potential
extensions include application to nonlinear chirps, adaptive kernel design, and
signal classification using extracted features.

### [4] [Power-Constrained and Quantized MIMO-RSMA Systems with Imperfect CSIT: Joint Precoding, Antenna Selection, and Power Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05080)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合预编码、天线选择和功率控制的算法，以最大化多用户MIMO系统的频谱效率，并通过仿真验证了中分辨率DAC的能效优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了充分利用基站的可用功率潜力，研究如何在高功率预算下优化多用户MIMO系统的性能。

Method: 将频谱效率最大化问题分解为预编码方向和功率控制子问题，分别通过拉格朗日静止点和梯度下降法解决，并提出了适合大规模MIMO的复杂度降低方法。

Result: 仿真表明，在充分利用功率预算时，8-11位的中分辨率DAC比低分辨率DAC更具能效优势。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效且中分辨率DAC在功率效率上表现更优。

Abstract: To utilize the full potential of the available power at a base station (BS),
we propose a joint precoding, antenna selection, and transmit power control
algorithm for a total power budget at the BS. We formulate a sum spectral
efficiency (SE) maximization problem for downlink multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems with
arbitrary-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs). We reformulate the
problem by defining the ergodic sum SE using the conditional average rate
approach to handle imperfect channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT), and by using approximation techniques to make the problem more
tractable. Then, we decompose the problem into precoding direction and power
control subproblems. We solve the precoding direction subproblem by identifying
a superior Lagrangian stationary point, and the power control subproblem using
gradient descent. We also propose a complexity-reduction approach that is more
suitable for massive MIMO systems. Simulation results not only validate the
proposed algorithm but also reveal that when utilizing the full potential of
the power budget at the BS, medium-resolution DACs with 8-11 bits may actually
be more power-efficient than low-resolution DACs.

### [5] [Digital Twin Channel-Aided CSI Prediction: A Environment-based Subspace Extraction Approach for Achieving Low Overhead and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05142)
*Yichen Cai,Jianhua Zhang,Li Yu,Zhen Zhang,Yuxiang Zhang,Lianzheng Shi,Yuelong Qiu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于环境特定信道子空间基（EB）的部分到全信道状态信息（CSI）预测方法（EB-P2WCP），用于低开销信道预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足6G移动通信系统在复杂场景下的高鲁棒性和高速通信需求，降低系统开销。

Method: 利用EB表征电磁环境的静态特性，结合实时估计的局部CSI预测整个空间频率域信道，设计了EB-P2WNet网络。

Result: 仿真结果表明，在低信噪比和低导频比条件下，EB的引入显著降低了50%的导频开销，并保持了抗多用户干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过EB辅助预测，实现了低开销且鲁棒的信道预测，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: To meet the robust and high-speed communication requirements of the
sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system in complex scenarios,
sensing- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twin channel (DTC)
techniques become a promising approach to reduce system overhead. In this
paper, we propose an environment-specific channel subspace basis (EB)-aided
partial-to-whole channel state information (CSI) prediction method (EB-P2WCP)
for realizing DTC-enabled low-overhead channel prediction. Specifically, EB is
utilized to characterize the static properties of the electromagnetic
environment, which is extracted from the digital twin map, serving as
environmental information prior to the prediction task. Then, we fuse EB with
real-time estimated local CSI to predict the entire spatial-frequency domain
channel for both the present and future time instances. Hence, an EB-based
partial-to-whole CSI prediction network (EB-P2WNet) is designed to achieve a
robust channel prediction scheme in various complex scenarios. Simulation
results indicate that incorporating EB provides significant benefits under low
signal-to-noise ratio and pilot ratio conditions, achieving a reduction of up
to 50% in pilot overhead. Additionally, the proposed method maintains
robustness against multi-user interference, tolerating 3-meter localization
errors with only a 0.5 dB NMSE increase, and predicts CSI for the next channel
coherent time within 1.3 milliseconds.

### [6] [Optimization of Liquid Lens-based Imaging Receiver for MIMO VLC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05204)
*Kapila W. S. Palitharathna,Christodoulos Skouroumounis,Ioannis Krikidis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于液态透镜的成像接收器，用于MIMO可见光通信系统，通过动态调整透镜焦距和角度降低信道增益空间相关性，显著提升误码率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态透镜在动态条件下（如用户移动或接收器随机方向）适应性不足，影响MIMO可见光通信的误码率性能。液态透镜的动态调整能力为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 开发了准确的信道增益数学模型，提出两种透镜调整方案（CLS和VULO），并通过优化问题最小化误码率。

Result: 数值结果表明，液态透镜接收器在随机方向条件下，误码率从4×10^-2显著降至5×10^-4。

Conclusion: 液态透镜在MIMO可见光通信系统中展现出优越的动态适应性，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a liquid lens-based imaging receiver is proposed for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC)
systems. By dynamically adjusting the focal length and orientation angles of
the liquid lens, the spatial correlation between MIMO channel gains is reduced,
leading to enhanced bit-error rate (BER) performance. Unlike static lenses,
liquid lenses offer adaptability in dynamic conditions, including user mobility
and random receiver orientation. An accurate mathematical framework is
developed to model the channel gains of the proposed system, and an
optimization problem is formulated to minimize its BER. Due to the complexity
of the resulting channel model, two lens adjustment schemes, namely, ($i$) the
CLS scheme, and ($ii$) the VULO scheme are introduced. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed liquid lens-based system offers substantial BER
improvements over conventional static lens-based receivers across a wide range
of random receiver orientation conditions. Specifically, at a random receiver
orientation variance of $10^{\circ}$, the BER is improved from $4\times
10^{-2}$ to $5\times 10^{-4}$ by employing the proposed liquid lens.

### [7] [Deep Learning Based Dynamic Environment Reconstruction for Vehicular ISAC Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05226)
*Junzhe Song,Ruisi He,Mi Yang,Zhengyu Zhang,Bingcheng Liu,Jiahui Han,Haoxiang Zhang,Bo Ai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于深度学习的集成感知与通信（ISAC）框架，用于智能交通系统中的车辆环境动态重建，解决了现有方法在动态场景跟踪和时态一致性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来的智能交通系统需要低成本且高精度的环境感知能力，现有ISAC方法在动态场景重建中存在精度和时态一致性不足的问题。

Method: 通过多模态测量数据建立联合信道环境数据集，并开发了一个多阶段深度学习网络，包括场景解码器、聚类中心解码器和点云解码器，以实现环境的重建。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在Chamfer距离和F Score@1%指标上表现优异，分别为0.29和0.87，并证明了其在实时场景中的高效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于ISAC的低成本环境重建提供了可行方案，对智能交通系统的未来发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology plays a critical role
in future intelligent transportation systems, by enabling vehicles to perceive
and reconstruct the surrounding environment through reuse of wireless signals,
thereby reducing or even eliminating the need for additional sensors such as
LiDAR or radar. However, existing ISAC based reconstruction methods often lack
the ability to track dynamic scenes with sufficient accuracy and temporal
consistency, limiting the real world applicability. To address this limitation,
we propose a deep learning based framework for vehicular environment
reconstruction by using ISAC channels. We first establish a joint channel
environment dataset based on multi modal measurements from real world urban
street scenarios. Then, a multistage deep learning network is developed to
reconstruct the environment. Specifically, a scene decoder identifies the
environmental context such as buildings, trees and so on; a cluster center
decoder predicts coarse spatial layouts by localizing dominant scattering
centers; a point cloud decoder recovers fine grained geometry and structure of
surrounding environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves high-quality dynamic environment reconstruction with a Chamfer
Distance of 0.29 and F Score@1% of 0.87. In addition, complexity analysis
demonstrates the efficiency and practical applicability of the method in real
time scenarios. This work provides a pathway toward low cost environment
reconstruction based on ISAC for future intelligent transportation.

### [8] [Unifying Common Signal Analyses with Instantaneous Time-Frequency Atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05380)
*Steven Sandoval,Phillip L. De Leon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于瞬时时间频率原子的方法，统一了多种信号分析技术，并给出了对应的瞬时频谱的闭合形式表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作提出了瞬时时间频率分析的通用框架，但未提供具体计算方法。本文旨在通过瞬时时间频率原子实现通用框架的具体应用，并统一多种信号分析技术。

Method: 使用瞬时时间频率原子，结合AM-FM分量分解思想，将每种信号分析视为基于二次短时傅里叶变换的模板，并利用两参数二次短时傅里叶变换组织瞬时频谱为二维连续统一体。

Result: 推导了多种信号分析对应的瞬时频谱闭合形式表达式，并通过示例信号验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过瞬时时间频率原子和二次短时傅里叶变换，成功统一了多种信号分析，并验证了其通用性和实用性。

Abstract: In previous work, we presented a general framework for instantaneous
time-frequency analysis but did not provide any specific details of how to
compute a particular instantaneous spectrum (IS). In this work, we use
instantaneous time-frequency atoms to obtain an IS associated with common
signal analyses: time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, fractional
Fourier transform, synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, and
synchrosqueezed short-time fractional Fourier transform. By doing so, we
demonstrate how the general framework can be used to unify these analyses and
we develop closed-form expressions for the corresponding ISs. This is
accomplished by viewing these analyses as decompositions into AM--FM components
and recognizing that each uses a specialized (or limiting) form of a quadratic
chirplet as a template during analysis. With a two-parameter quadratic
chirplet, we can organize these ISs into a 2D continuum with points in the
plane corresponding to a decomposition related to one of the signal analyses.
Finally, using several example signals, we compute in closed-form the ISs for
the various analyses.

### [9] [Sub- μ W Battery-Less and Oscillator-Less Wi-Fi Backscattering Transmitter Reusing RF Signal for Harvesting, Communications, and Motion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05479)
*Marco Privitera,Andrea Ballo,Karim Ali Ahmed,Alfio Dario Grasso,Massimo Alioto*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种低于微瓦级的802.11b反向散射发射器，能够重复利用同一入射波实现射频能量收集、反向散射通信和位置/运动传感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过消除电池和外部运动传感器（如MEMS），实现前所未有的小型化、普及性、无限设备寿命以及低制造成本和维护成本。

Method: 通过消除本地振荡器并利用双音入射波的二阶互调提取频率，突破了WiFi发射器的微瓦级功耗限制。

Result: 实现了累积收集/传输/传感灵敏度低至 -19 dBm，并能通过采集的电压作为接收信号强度（RSS）代理，实现位置/运动传感。

Conclusion: 该技术为室内环境中的标签提供了一种低功耗、低成本的多功能解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, a sub-uW power 802.11b backscattering transmitter is presented
to enable reuse of the same incident wave for three purposes: RF harvesting,
backscattering communications and position/motion sensing. The removal of the
battery and any off-chip motion sensor (e.g., MEMS) enables unprecedented level
of miniaturization and ubiquity, unrestricted device lifespan, low fabrication
and maintenance cost. The uW power wall for WiFi transmitters is broken for the
first time via local oscillator elimination, as achieved by extracting its
frequency through second-order intermodulation of a twotone incident wave. The
two-tone scheme also enables a cumulative harvesting/transmission/sensing
sensitivity down to Pmin -19 dBm. Position/motion sensing is enabled by using
the harvested voltage as a proxy for the Received Signal Strength (RSS),
allowing to sense the chip location with respect to the tone generator(s)
shared across tags in indoor neighborhoods.

Abstract: A four-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) for ultra-low-power
applications is introduced in this paper. The proposed circuit inclusive of
frequency compensation requires minimal transistor count and passives,
overcoming the traditionally difficult compensation of 4-stage OTAs and
bringing it back to the simplicity of 3-stage OTAs. At the same time, the
proposed circuit achieves high power efficiency, as evidenced by the >3.7X
(>11.3X) improvement in the large-signal (small-signal) power efficiency figure
of merit FOML (FOMS), compared to prior 4-stage OTAs (sub-1 V multi-stage
OTAs). Thanks to the lower sensitivity of the phase margin to the load
capacitance, the proposed OTA remains stable under a wide range of loads
(double-sided as in any 3-4-stage OTA), achieving a max/min ratio of the load
capacitance of >100X.

### [11] [Q-DPTS: Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting via Variational Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05036)
*Chi-Sheng Chen,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合量子与经典方法的差分隐私时间序列预测框架Q-DPTS，在保护数据隐私的同时提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融和能源系统等数据敏感的领域，时间序列预测至关重要。传统差分隐私方法（如DP-SGD）因噪声注入导致模型性能下降，需要探索新的隐私保护与预测性能平衡的方法。

Method: Q-DPTS结合变分量子电路（VQC）、逐样本梯度裁剪和高斯噪声注入，确保严格的差分隐私。通过量子模型的表达能力减少隐私保护带来的性能损失。

Result: 在ETT数据集上的实验表明，Q-DPTS在相同隐私预算下，预测误差低于经典和量子基线模型（如LSTM、QASA等）。

Conclusion: Q-DPTS为隐私关键场景下的时间序列建模提供了安全且准确的解决方案，是量子增强差分隐私预测的首批探索之一。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is
paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP)
provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its
integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to
injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical
framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS
combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping
and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables
improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We
evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a
standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is
compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA,
QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower
prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable
privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations
into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising
directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续变量量子密钥分发（CV-QKD）中，准确的信道参数估计对信息协调至关重要，但传统最大似然估计方法需要大量丢弃数据且效率低。

Method: 提出了一种联合消息传递方案，利用期望最大化算法在解码过程中同时估计未知参数，结合多维旋转方案减少经典信道开销。

Result: 该方法首次统一了多维协调和信道参数估计，为高效率的信息协调提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方案显著减少了符号丢弃和经典信道开销，提升了CV-QKD的实用性和效率。

Abstract: Accurate quantum channel parameter estimation is essential for effective
information reconciliation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution
(CV-QKD). However, conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimators rely on a
large amount of discarded data (or pilot symbols), leading to a significant
loss in symbol efficiency. Moreover, the separation between the estimation and
reconciliation phases can introduce error propagation. In this paper, we
propose a novel joint message-passing scheme that unifies channel parameter
estimation and information reconciliation within a Bayesian framework. By
leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method
simultaneously estimates unknown parameters during decoding, eliminating the
need for separate ML estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid
multidimensional rotation scheme that removes the requirement for norm
feedback, significantly reducing classical channel overhead. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to unify multidimensional reconciliation and
channel parameter estimation in CV-QKD, providing a practical solution for
high-efficiency reconciliation with minimal pilots.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

rate and outage probability against a fixed power allocation scheme. Our scheme
achieves up to a 23% sum rate gain over fixed PA at 30 dBm. Simulation results
validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness and
robustness of the RIS-assisted NOMA MIMO framework for THz enabled industrial
communications.

Abstract: This paper investigates the energy efficiency optimization for movable
antenna (MA) systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption
introduced by MA movement. We first derive the upper bound on energy efficiency
for a single-user downlink communication system, where the user is equipped
with a single MA. Then, the energy efficiency maximization problem is
formulated to optimize the MA position, and an efficient algorithm based on
successive convex approximation is proposed to solve this non-convex
optimization problem. Simulation results show that, despite the overhead caused
by MA movement, the MA system can still improve the energy efficiency compared
to the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) system.

Abstract: This paper investigates an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled integrated
sensing, communication, and computation system, with a particular focus on
integrating movable antennas (MAs) into the system for enhancing overall system
performance. Specifically, multiple MA-enabled AVVs perform sensing tasks and
simultaneously transmit the generated computational tasks to the base station
for processing. To minimize the maximum latency under the sensing and resource
constraints, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly coordinates the
position of the MAs, the computation resource allocation, and the transmit
beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and strong
coupling among variables, we propose a two-layer iterative algorithm leveraging
particle swarm optimization and convex optimization to address it. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant
latency improvements compared to the baseline schemes.

### [17] [Phase Noise Tolerance for Low-Pilot-Overhead OFDM Terahertz Links Beyond 64-QAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05026)

Conclusion: 微环谐振器是实现64-QAM以上OFDM太赫兹通信的关键技术，量化容忍度为系统设计提供指导。

Abstract: THz wireless communications have garnered significant attention due to their
unprecedented data rates enabled by the abundant untapped spectrum. However,
advanced modulation formats beyond 64-QAM remain largely unexplored, as phase
errors introduced during up/down-conversion severely limit system performance.
Particularly, OFDM transmission is highly susceptible to aggravated ICI induced
by phase noise, undermining the orthogonality of subcarriers. While PLLs and
pilot-assisted compensation can mitigate phase errors, excessive pilot overhead
compromises spectral efficiency and energy consumption, and white phase noise
remains unrecoverable. Therefore, quantifying phase noise tolerance is
essential for practical physical layer protocols. Here, we reveal the impact of
phase noise in a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM THz transmission system.
3{\sigma}-error estimation is proposed to quantify phase noise tolerance,
indicating an intuitive EVM threshold of approximately 5%. This threshold
further delineates the trade-offs among phase noise levels, SNR requirements,
and pilot overhead. Moreover, by benchmarking representative oscillators with
distinct phase noise spectra, microring resonators (MRRs) are identified as
indispensable enablers for low-pilot-overhead OFDM THz links operating beyond
64-QAM.
