We present Memoir, which employs\nimagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model\nimagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant\nenvironmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)\na language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual\npurposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)\nHybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral\npatterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an\nexperience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge\nthrough specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse\nmemory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios\ndemonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all\nscenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent\nbaseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory\nreduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental\nand behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis\nindicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this\nimagination-guided paradigm.

This imbalance creates a\nsignificant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations\ninstead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant\npredictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we\npropose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.\nInstead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the\nlearning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial\nreference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model\nto move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying\ncausal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations\nfrom a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance\ncaused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise\nNormalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization\nobjective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain\nwaypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate\nthe effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a\nstate-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two\ndenoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the\nlearning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to\nfacilitate further research."}
