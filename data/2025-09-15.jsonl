Developing\naccurate and reliable ML models depends on access to high-quality, annotated\ndata, a resource in short supply. ML competitions address this need by\nproviding researchers access to expertly annotated datasets, fostering shared\nlearning through direct model comparisons, and leveraging the benefits of\ncrowdsourcing diverse expertise. We compiled a retrospective dataset containing\n353 hours of EEG from 102 individual newborns from a multi-centre study. The\ndata was fully anonymised and divided into training, testing, and held-out\nvalidation datasets. EEGs were graded for the severity of abnormal background\npatterns. Next, we created a web-based competition platform and hosted a\nmachine learning competition to develop ML models for classifying the severity\nof EEG background patterns in newborns. After the competition closed, the top 4\nperforming models were evaluated offline on a separate held-out validation\ndataset. Although a feature-based model ranked first on the testing dataset,\ndeep learning models generalised better on the validation sets. All methods had\na significant decline in validation performance compared to the testing\nperformance. This highlights the challenges for model generalisation on unseen\ndata, emphasising the need for held-out validation datasets in ML studies with\nneonatal EEG. The study underscores the importance of training ML models on\nlarge and diverse datasets to ensure robust generalisation. The competition's\noutcome demonstrates the potential for open-access data and collaborative ML\ndevelopment to foster a collaborative research environment and expedite the\ndevelopment of clinical decision-support tools for neonatal neuromonitoring."}

To address this, we\npropose Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer (D-CAT), a framework that aligns\nmodality-specific representations without requiring joint sensor modality\nduring inference. Our approach combines a self-attention module for feature\nextraction with a novel cross-attention alignment loss, which enforces the\nalignment of sensors' feature spaces without requiring the coupling of the\nclassification pipelines of both modalities. We evaluate D-CAT on three\nmulti-modal human activity datasets (IMU, video, and audio) under both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, comparing against uni-modal\nmodels. Results show that in in-distribution scenarios, transferring from\nhigh-performing modalities (e.g., video to IMU) yields up to 10% F1-score gains\nover uni-modal training. In out-of-distribution scenarios, even weaker source\nmodalities (e.g., IMU to video) improve target performance, as long as the\ntarget model isn't overfitted on the training data. By enabling single-sensor\ninference with cross-modal knowledge, D-CAT reduces hardware redundancy for\nperception systems while maintaining accuracy, which is critical for\ncost-sensitive or adaptive deployments (e.g., assistive robots in homes with\nvariable sensor availability).

By contrast, we propose a\nnovel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware\nfusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses\nmultimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar\nmeasurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as\none of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our\ncorresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which\nare encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our\nattentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these\nlocal depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying\nreliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In\naddition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for\nlearning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse\nconditions.

This design bridges the\ngap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on\ncomputationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for\nmicrocontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates\nan average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline\npipeline when using the ORB feature tracker.

In practice, some of the robots\nexecuting the plan may get delayed, which can introduce collision risk.\nAlthough robust execution methods are used to ensure safety even in the\npresence of delays, the delays may still have a significant impact on the\nduration of the execution. At some point, the accumulated delays may become\nsignificant enough that instead of continuing with the execution of the\noriginal plan, even if it was optimal, there may now exist an alternate plan\nwhich will lead to a shorter execution. However, the problem is how to decide\nwhen to search for the alternate plan, since it is a costly procedure. In this\npaper, we propose a holistic architecture for robust execution of MAPF plans,\nits monitoring and optimization. We exploit a robust execution method called\nAction Dependency Graph to maintain an estimate of the expected execution\nduration during the plan's execution. This estimate is used to predict the\npotential that finding an alternate plan would lead to shorter execution.

Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint\nmutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during\nearly learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a\ntransition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately\nactionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system\nfailures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad\ncollapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action\ncoupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts\naction-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships. This\ndifferential diagnostic capability demonstrated through controlled perturbation\nexperiments enables precise fault localization without architectural\nmodifications or performance degradation.
