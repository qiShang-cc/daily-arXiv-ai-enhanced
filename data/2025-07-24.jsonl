This challenge is further amplified under process, voltage, and\ntemperature (PVT) variations, which cause circuit behavior to shift across\ndifferent corners. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in\nautomating sizing for fixed targets, training a generalized policy that can\nadapt to a wide range of design specifications under PVT variations requires\nmuch more training samples and resources. To address these challenges, we\npropose a \\textbf{Goal-conditioned RL framework} that enables efficient policy\ntraining for analog device sizing across PVT corners, with strong\ngeneralization capability. To improve sample efficiency, we introduce\nPareto-front Dominance Goal Sampling, which constructs an automatic curriculum\nby sampling goals from the Pareto frontier of previously achieved goals. This\nstrategy is further enhanced by integrating Conservative Hindsight Experience\nReplay, which assigns relabeled goals with conservative virtual rewards to\nstabilize training and accelerate convergence.

However, the\ndensely populated users and diverse services with high data rate demands has\ntriggered an increasing scarcity of UAV spectrum utilization. To tackle this\nproblem, it is promising to incorporate the underutilized unlicensed spectrum\nwith the licensed spectrum to boost network capacity. However, the openness of\nunlicensed spectrum makes UAVs susceptible to security threats from potential\njammers. Therefore, a spectrum sharing UAV network coexisting with licensed\ncellular network and unlicensed Wi-Fi network is considered with the\nanti-jamming technique in this paper. The sum rate maximization of the\nsecondary network is studied by jointly optimizing the transmit power,\nsubchannel allocation, and UAV trajectory. We first decompose the challenging\nnon-convex problem into two subproblems, 1) the joint power and subchannel\nallocation and 2) UAV trajectory design subproblems. A low-complexity iterative\nalgorithm is proposed in a alternating optimization manner over these two\nsubproblems to solve the formulated problem.

However, existing\nstudies commonly assume the absence of quantization distortion, which is\ninevitable, especially with non-ideal analog-to-digital converters. In this\nwork, we consider a state estimation problem with 1-bit quantization. 1-bit\nquantization causes significant quantization distortion and severe information\nloss, rendering conventional state estimation strategies unsuitable. To address\nthis, inspired by the Bussgang decomposition technique, we first develop the\nBussgang-aided Kalman filter by assuming perfectly known models.

Current visual BCI systems\nsuffer from insufficient information transfer rates (ITRs) for practical use.\nSpatial information, a critical component of visual perception, remains\nunderexploited in existing systems because the limited spatial resolution of\nrecording methods hinders the capture of the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of\nbrain signals. This study proposed a frequency-phase-space fusion encoding\nmethod, integrated with 256-channel high-density electroencephalogram (EEG)\nrecordings, to develop high-speed BCI systems. In the classical frequency-phase\nencoding 40-target BCI paradigm, the 256-66, 128-32, and 64-21 electrode\nconfigurations brought theoretical ITR increases of 83.66%, 79.99%, and 55.50%\nover the traditional 64-9 setup. In the proposed frequency-phase-space encoding\n200-target BCI paradigm, these increases climbed to 195.56%, 153.08%, and\n103.07%. The online BCI system achieved an average actual ITR of 472.7 bpm.\nThis study demonstrates the essential role and immense potential of\nhigh-density EEG in decoding the spatiotemporal information of visual stimuli."}

This\npaper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor\nwithin a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish\nkey theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under\nperfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources\ngrows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected\noutput conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,\nwhen only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall\nexpected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated\npredictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to\nachieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability\nrequirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot\nimprove the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new\ninformation about future channel states. Additionally, we show that\nwell-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that\nnecessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition\nthat the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to\noccur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous\nsimulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt\nscaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is\ntrained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.\nFurthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with\ntemporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver\nmobility."}

In this model, each vertex\ncorresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers if and only\nif there is an edge between them. We consider the setting where the server-side\ncommon randomness necessary to accomplish SPIR is also replicated at the\nservers according to the graph, and we call this as message-specific common\nrandomness. In this setting, we establish a lower bound on the SPIR capacity,\ni.e., the maximum download rate, for general graphs, by proposing an achievable\nSPIR scheme. Next, we prove that, for any SPIR scheme to be feasible, the\nminimum size of message-specific randomness should be equal to the size of a\nmessage. Finally, by providing matching upper bounds, we derive the exact SPIR\ncapacity for the class of path and regular graphs."}
