Despite these advantages, CMI still encounters\nnotable computational bottlenecks, especially during the image reconstruction\nstage. In this setting, both image recovery and object classification present\nsignificant processing demands. To address these challenges, our previous work\nintroduced ClassiGAN, which is a generative deep learning model designed to\nsimultaneously reconstruct images and classify targets using only\nback-scattered signals. In this study, we build upon that framework by\nincorporating attention gate modules into ClassiGAN. These modules are intended\nto refine feature extraction and improve the identification of relevant\ninformation. By dynamically focusing on important features and suppressing\nirrelevant ones, the attention mechanism enhances the overall model\nperformance. The proposed architecture, named Att-ClassiGAN, significantly\nreduces the reconstruction time compared to traditional CMI approaches.\nFurthermore, it outperforms current advanced methods, delivering improved\nNormalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), higher Structural Similarity Index\n(SSIM), and better classification outcomes for the reconstructed targets."}

In this paper, we investigate secure transmission in\nnear-field multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenarios.\nSpecifically, with the advent of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA)\napplied in the NFC regime, the spatial degrees of freedom in the channel matrix\nare significantly enhanced. This creates an expanded null space that can be\nexploited for designing secure communication schemes. Motivated by this\nobservation, we propose a near-field dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture\nincorporating artificial noise, which effectively disrupts eavesdroppers at any\nundesired positions, even in the absence of their channel state information\n(CSI). Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the dynamic precoder's\nperformance in terms of the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio,\nachievable rate, secrecy capacity, secrecy outage probability, and the size of\nthe secrecy zone. In contrast to far-field secure transmission techniques that\nonly enhance security in the angular dimension, the proposed algorithm exploits\nthe unique properties of spherical wave characteristics in NFC to achieve\nsecure transmission in both the angular and distance dimensions. Remarkably,\nthe proposed algorithm is applicable to arbitrary modulation types and array\nconfigurations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\napproximately 20\\% higher rate capacity compared to zero-forcing and the\nweighted minimum mean squared error precoders."}

In this regard, remarkable attention has been paid\nrecently to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm as an\nenabler for efficiently and jointly performing communication and sensing using\nthe same spectrum and hardware resources. On the other hand, ensuring\ncommunication and data security has been an imperative requirement for wireless\nnetworks throughout their evolution. The physical-layer security (PLS) concept\npaved the way to catering to the security needs in wireless networks in a\nsustainable way while guaranteeing theoretically secure transmissions,\nindependently of the computational capacity of adversaries. Therefore, it is of\nparamount importance to consider a balanced trade-off between communication\nreliability, sensing, and security in future networks, such as the 5G and\nbeyond, and the 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and system-wise\nreview of designed secure ISAC systems from a PLS point of view. In particular,\nthe impact of various physical-layer techniques, schemes, and wireless\ntechnologies to ensure the sensing-security trade-off is studied from the\nsurveyed work. Furthermore, the amalgamation of PLS and ISAC is analyzed in a\nbroader impact by considering attacks targeting data confidentiality,\ncommunication covertness, and sensing spoofing. The paper also serves as a\ntutorial by presenting several theoretical foundations on ISAC and PLS, which\nrepresent a practical guide for readers to develop novel secure ISAC network\ndesigns."}
