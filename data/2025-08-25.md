### [1] [Secure ISAC Systems Empowered by Compound Reconfigurable Antenna Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16055)
*Mengzhen Liu,Ming Li,Rang Liu,Qian Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于复合可重构天线阵列的安全ISAC框架，通过联合电磁域和基带域设计，显著提升雷达感知和通信安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理层安全方法在空间分辨率和相关信道影响上受限，需要新的方案来提升ISAC系统的安全性。

Method: 提出了一种混合整数非线性规划问题，结合FP、MM、SOCP和惩罚方法，设计联合电磁域和基带域的预编码器和组合器。

Result: 仿真结果显示，新框架在雷达感知上比传统波束成形提升12dB，同时保持通信安全性。

Conclusion: 通过联合利用电磁域的自由度，可以显著提升安全ISAC系统的性能。

Abstract: In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the use of
dual-functional signals inherently exposes confidential communication
information during radar sensing, particularly when the sensing target itself
acts as an eavesdropper. Conventional physical-layer security solutions rely on
directional beamforming or artificial noise injection implemented via signal
processing in the baseband (BB) domain. However, these BB-domain approaches are
constrained by insufficient spatial resolution and the adverse effects of
spatially correlated channels. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes a novel secure ISAC framework empowered by compound reconfigurable
antenna (CRA) arrays, which offer simultaneous reconfigurability of radiation
patterns and polarization states in the electromagnetic (EM) domain.
Specifically, we develop a comprehensive channel model incorporating virtual
angular domain, spatial domain, and depolarization effects, and formulate a
mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly design EM-domain
and BB-domain precoders and combiners. To efficiently solve this complex
optimization problem, we propose an iterative decomposition-based algorithm
leveraging fractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM),
second-order cone programming (SOCP), and penalty methods. Extensive simulation
results demonstrate that the CRA array architecture with proposed joint EM-and
BB-domain design achieves significant performance improvements in secure ISAC
systems. In particular, radar sensing gains of up to 12dB are observed over
conventional beamforming, while robust communication security is maintained.
These results highlight the considerable benefits attainable by jointly
leveraging additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the EM domain for secure
ISAC system design.

### [2] [FM OFDM Unifying High Mobility Communications and Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16107)
*Amir Bouziane,Huseyin Arslan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: FM OFDM作为一种恒定包络波形，在高移动性和双色散信道条件下，为6G系统的集成传感与通信（ISAC）提供了优越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来6G系统需要支持高吞吐量数据传输和精确环境感知的波形设计，而OFDM的高峰值平均功率比（PAPR）在高频段带来挑战。

Method: 研究了FM OFDM作为恒定包络波形的性能，推导了其在时变多径信道中的输入输出关系，并分析了载波间干扰（ICI）、多普勒效应等。

Result: 模拟实验显示，FM OFDM在高速移动和高信噪比条件下，比CP OFDM和CE OFDM具有更优越的距离和速度估计精度。

Conclusion: FM OFDM适合作为6G高频ISAC应用的统一波形。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is foundational to future sixth
generation (6G) systems, demanding waveform co-design that supports both high
throughput data transmission and accurate environmental perception. While
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) offers flexibility and
backward compatibility, its high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) poses
significant challenges at higher frequency bands. To address this, we
investigate Frequency Modulated Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (FM
OFDM) a constant envelope waveform that facilitates robust joint sensing and
communication under highly mobile, doubly dispersive channel conditions. We
derive a comprehensive input output relationship for FM OFDM in time varying
multipath channels, including analytical expressions for Inter Carrier
Interference (ICI), Doppler effects, and effective channel gains. Extensive
simulations comparing FM OFDM with conventional Cyclic Prefix Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP OFDM) and Constant Envelope Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing (CE OFDM) demonstrate superior range and
velocity estimation accuracy of FM-OFDM, particularly at high Signal to Noise
Ratios (SNRs) and under high mobility, highlighting its suitability as a
unified waveform for high frequency ISAC applications in 6G.

### [3] [A Scalable Hybrid Track-Before-Detect Tracking System: Application to Coastal Maritime Radar Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16169)
*Lukas Herrmann,Ángel F. García-Fernández,Edmund F. Brekke,Egil Eide*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合TBD和检测的多目标跟踪框架，用于海岸雷达监视，展示了其在复杂环境中的实际应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管TBD方法理论上有优势，但实际应用中因计算复杂和可扩展性差而受限。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合基于IE-PHPMHT的TBD模块和PMBM点跟踪器，处理雷达数据并实现强弱目标的跟踪。

Result: 使用真实雷达数据验证，显示了在资源受限的大范围观测中的鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该框架适合复杂海上环境的实际部署，支持海岸监视和自主系统。

Abstract: Despite their theoretical advantages, track-before-detect (TBD) methods
remain largely absent from real-world multi-target tracking applications due to
their computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper presents a
scalable hybrid tracking framework that combines a TBD multi-target tracking
algorithm with a detection-based multi-target tracking algorithm for coastal
radar surveillance. In particular, the approach uses an integrated existence
Poisson histogram-probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracking (IE-PHPMHT)-based TBD
module with a conventional Poisson multi-Bernoulli Mixture (PMBM) point
tracker. The system processes raw radar data through land clutter suppression,
cell-wise detection, and clustering-based feature extraction. High-threshold
detections are used to track strong targets via the point tracker, while
low-threshold detections are employed for adaptive birth in the TBD module,
enabling early initiation and sustained tracking of weak or ambiguous targets.
Validated using real X-band radar data from the Trondheim Fjord, Norway, the
approach demonstrates robust multi-target tracking performance in a full-scale
application with a large observation area under resource constraints,
highlighting its suitability for operational deployment in complex maritime
environments needed for coastal surveillance and to support autonomy.

### [4] [Hybrid Precoding Revisited: Low-Dimensional Subspace Perspective for MU-MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16218)
*Mintaek Oh,Jinseok Choi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种低复杂度的混合预编码框架，利用低维子空间特性优化多用户MIMO系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多用户MIMO系统中传统预编码方法计算复杂度高的问题，作者提出了一种基于低维子空间特性的新框架。

Method: 首先识别了无约束的最优射频预编码器，然后通过降复杂度预编码方法优化混合预编码器，并进一步扩展为动态子阵列天线分区和统计信道信息利用方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提算法在显著降低复杂度的同时，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为多用户MIMO系统提供了一种高效且稳健的预编码解决方案。

Abstract: This letter presents a low-complexity hybrid precoding framework for
multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by leveraging a
low-dimensional subspace property. Under the low-dimensional subspace
perspective, we first identify an unconstrained optimal radio-frequency (RF)
precoder. We then optimize a hybrid precoder via a reduced-complexity precoding
method. We further extend the proposed framework to (i) a dynamic-subarray
antenna partitioning algorithm that adaptively allocates subsets of antennas
associated with RF chains, and (ii) a channel covariance-based approach to
exploit statistical channel state information at a transmitter (CSIT), ensuring
robustness with partial CSIT. Simulations validate that our proposed algorithms
achieve superior performance while significantly reducing complexity compared
to existing methods.

### [5] [Parameter-Free Logit Distillation via Sorting Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16544)
*Stephen Ekaputra Limantoro*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的排序机制，用于改进知识蒸馏（KD）中教师模型的不正确预测，并通过重新排序分布来优化知识传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KD方法通常直接使用教师模型的原始分布，忽略了错误预测的潜力，这可能影响知识蒸馏的效果。

Method: 采用排序机制处理logit，修正教师模型的错误预测并重新排序分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该排序机制是一种易于使用的预处理方法，能够显著提升现有KD方法的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge from the teacher
(larger) to the student (smaller) model via soft-label for the efficient neural
network. In general, the performance of a model is determined by accuracy,
which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the
teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect
prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through
cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on
certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing
scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal:
(1) fixing the incorrect prediction of the teacher based on the labels and (2)
reordering the distribution in a natural way according to priority rank at
once. As an easy-to-use, plug-and-play pre-processing, our sort method can be
effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments
on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 作者提出了名为Spatial Policy (SP)的统一空间感知视觉运动机器人操作框架，通过显式空间建模和推理来解决现有方法在复杂环境中缺乏空间感知能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的分层具身模型在长时程机器人控制中表现出潜力，但缺乏空间感知能力，限制了其在复杂环境中将视觉计划转化为可执行控制的能力。


Method: SP框架包括三个模块：1) 空间条件具身视频生成模块，通过空间计划表建模空间导向预测；2) 基于空间的动作预测模块，通过协调推断可执行动作；3) 空间推理反馈策略，通过双阶段重新规划优化空间计划表。

Result: 实验表明，SP显著优于现有基线，平均改进33.0%，在11项多样任务中平均成功率达到86.7%。

Conclusion: SP成功提升了具身模型在机器人控制应用中的实用性，代码和检查点已开源。

Abstract: Vision-centric hierarchical embodied models have demonstrated strong
potential for long-horizon robotic control. However, existing methods lack
spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual
plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem,
we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic
manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning.
Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation
module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table.
Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable
actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback
policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive
experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7%
average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the
practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications. Code and

### [7] [UnPose: Uncertainty-Guided Diffusion Priors for Zero-Shot Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15972)
*Zhaodong Jiang,Ashish Sinha,Tongtong Cao,Yuan Ren,Bingbing Liu,Binbin Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UnPose提出了一种零样本、无模型的6D物体姿态估计和重建框架，利用预训练扩散模型的3D先验和不确定性估计，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人领域中新型物体6D姿态估计问题，避免依赖CAD模型或额外训练的需求，提升实用性和效率。

Method: 利用多视图扩散模型和3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）表示，通过不确定性引导的视图融合逐步优化3D模型和姿态估计。

Result: 实验表明，UnPose在6D姿态估计精度和3D重建质量上显著优于现有方法，并在实际机器人任务中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: UnPose通过结合扩散模型的先验和不确定性估计，为无模型6D姿态估计提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

### [8] [GelSLAM: A Real-time, High-Fidelity, and Robust 3D Tactile SLAM System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15990)
*Hung-Jui Huang,Mohammad Amin Mirzaee,Michael Kaess,Wenzhen Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GelSLAM是一种仅依赖触觉传感的实时3D SLAM系统，用于高精度物体姿态估计和形状重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉传感在精确抓取和操作中具有优势，尤其是在遮挡情况下。

Method: 利用触觉衍生的表面法线和曲率进行跟踪和闭环，优于传统点云方法。

Result: 实时跟踪误差低且漂移小，形状重建精度达到亚毫米级。

Conclusion: GelSLAM扩展了触觉传感的全局感知能力，为高精度操作任务奠定基础。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

### [10] [Take That for Me: Multimodal Exophora Resolution with Interactive Questioning for Ambiguous Out-of-View Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16143)
*Akira Oyama,Shoichi Hasegawa,Akira Taniguchi,Yoshinobu Hagiwara,Tadahiro Taniguchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MIEL是一个多模态交互式指代消解框架，通过声音定位、语义地图、视觉语言模型和GPT-4o提问，解决机器人理解模糊指令的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉数据，无法处理用户或对象不在视野的情况。MIEL的目标是解决这一问题，提升机器人对模糊指令的理解能力。

Method: 结合声音定位（SSL）、语义地图、视觉语言模型和GPT-4o提问，首先构建环境语义地图，然后通过SSL定位用户，并通过交互提问消除歧义。

Result: 实验显示，MIEL在用户可见和不可见情况下的表现分别比传统方法提高了1.3倍和2.0倍。

Conclusion: MIEL通过多模态交互显著提升了机器人对指代消解任务的性能，尤其在用户或对象不可见时表现出色。

Abstract: Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions
involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or
users are out of the robot's view. Existing approaches to exophora resolution
primarily rely on visual data and thus fail in real-world scenarios where the
object or user is not visible. We propose Multimodal Interactive Exophora
resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora
resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic
mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with
GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and
estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal
data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially
outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and
pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts
with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments
in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times
better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the
user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and
interactive questioning. The project website is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯过程（GP）的新型SLAM方法，通过对象轮廓建模环境，实现高效的在线更新和语义信息提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM方法通常使用网格地图或点云配准，缺乏语义信息和高斯过程带来的形状不确定性估计。

Method: 采用GP建模对象轮廓，并结合贝叶斯框架进行机器人位姿和地图的联合推断。

Result: 方法在合成和真实环境中验证，表现出准确的定位和建图性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提供了语义信息，还支持下游任务（如安全导航和探索）。

Abstract: We present a novel Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method that
employs Gaussian Process (GP) based landmark (object) representations. Instead
of conventional grid maps or point cloud registration, we model the environment
on a per object basis using GP based contour representations. These contours
are updated online through a recursive scheme, enabling efficient memory usage.
The SLAM problem is formulated within a fully Bayesian framework, allowing
joint inference over the robot pose and object based map. This representation
provides semantic information such as the number of objects and their areas,
while also supporting probabilistic measurement to object associations.
Furthermore, the GP based contours yield confidence bounds on object shapes,
offering valuable information for downstream tasks like safe navigation and
exploration. We validate our method on synthetic and real world experiments,
and show that it delivers accurate localization and mapping performance across
diverse structured environments.

### [12] [Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA): Robot Swarms Adapt Better to Localization Dropouts Then a Single Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16460)
*Jiri Horyna,Roland Jung,Stephan Weiss,Eliseo Ferrante,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SWA的方法，用于在无人机群中实现状态估计，通过融合分散的状态估计、鲁棒相互感知和机载传感器数据，应对定位失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决无人机群在定位失效情况下如何通过相对信息维持稳定状态的问题。

Method: 融合分散的状态估计、鲁棒相互感知和机载传感器数据，利用相对信息进行横向状态估计。

Result: 实现了速度共识，抑制了除整体平移漂移外的所有干扰，提高了多无人机系统的可靠性和弹性。

Conclusion: 模拟和实验验证了SWA方法在定位不可靠或失效情况下维持群体行为的能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA) approach to
state estimation in swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) experiencing
ego-localization dropout, where individual agents are laterally stabilized
using relative information only. We propose to fuse decentralized state
estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard sensor data to maintain
accurate state awareness despite intermittent localization failures. Thus, the
relative information used to estimate the lateral state of UAVs enables the
identification of the unambiguous state of UAVs with respect to the local
constellation. The resulting behavior reaches velocity consensus, as this task
can be referred to as the double integrator synchronization problem. All
disturbances and performance degradations except a uniform translation drift of
the swarm as a whole is attenuated which is enabling new opportunities in using
tight cooperation for increasing reliability and resilience of multi-UAV
systems. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach, demonstrating its capability to sustain cohesive swarm behavior
in challenging conditions of unreliable or unavailable primary localization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于波士顿动力Spot机器人的地形分类器，旨在解决四足机器人在复杂地形中的下沉和打滑问题，准确率约为97%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四足机器人虽然在多种地形中表现优于轮式机器人，但在复杂地形中容易出现下沉和打滑等不良行为。通过开发地形分类器，可以为机器人生成可通行地图，从而规划更安全的路径。

Method: 利用Spot机器人提供的100多个本体感受信号（如脚部穿透力、力和关节角度等），结合降维技术提取关键信息，并使用分类技术根据可通行性区分地形。

Result: 在代表性实地测试中，地形分类器能够以约97%的准确率识别三种不同的地形类型。

Conclusion: 该地形分类器能有效帮助四足机器人识别复杂地形，提高其在多类型地形中的导航安全性。

Abstract: Quadrupedal mobile robots can traverse a wider range of terrain types than
their wheeled counterparts but do not perform the same on all terrain types.
These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on
challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier
that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems
to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate.
The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics
Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing
the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces,
joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality
reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then
applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on
traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain
classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy
of approximately 97%

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决汽车类车辆在复杂环境下的动力学规划问题，同时优化路径和控制序列，提升计算效率并严格遵守约束条件。

Method: 将问题初始化为混合整数分数规划，通过变量变换转为混合整数双线性目标，再用McCormick包络松弛为混合整数线性规划，分析控制空间和地形避免局部最小值。

Result: 仿真比较显示，该方法比MPPI和log-MPPI快104倍，且严格满足约束条件。

Conclusion: 该方法高效解决了汽车类车辆的动力学规划问题，为复杂3D环境中的路径规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work casts the kinodynamic planning problem for car-like vehicles as an
optimization task to compute a minimum-time trajectory and its associated
velocity profile, subject to boundary conditions on velocity, acceleration, and
steering. The approach simultaneously optimizes both the spatial path and the
sequence of acceleration and steering controls, ensuring continuous motion from
a specified initial position and velocity to a target end position and
velocity.The method analyzes the admissible control space and terrain to avoid
local minima. The proposed method operates efficiently in simplicial complex
environments, a preferred terrain representation for capturing intricate 3D
landscapes. The problem is initially posed as a mixed-integer fractional
program with quadratic constraints, which is then reformulated into a
mixed-integer bilinear objective through a variable transformation and
subsequently relaxed to a mixed-integer linear program using McCormick
envelopes. Comparative simulations against planners such as MPPI and log-MPPI
demonstrate that the proposed approach generates solutions 104 times faster
while strictly adhering to the specified constraints

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机路径规划和避障中的算法效率和适用性问题。

Method: 设计了三种实验，在3D城市环境中测试A*、RRT*和PSO算法的性能，包括不同地图大小、高度和障碍物密度。

Result: A*算法在计算效率和路径质量上表现最佳，PSO适用于密集环境，RRT*在所有实验中表现均衡。

Conclusion: A*算法综合表现最优，不同算法适用于不同场景，为无人机路径规划提供实用参考。

Abstract: The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding
obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning
algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.

Method: 结合DRL进行高级导航决策，模糊逻辑控制器处理低级运动约束，避免机械损伤和轮滑。

Result: 仿真及实验证明框架优于传统方法，提升训练效率和稳定性，减少DRL方案的异常行为。

Conclusion: 为复杂工业环境中的4WISD机器人提供了一种可扩展且可靠的导航解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous
navigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The
proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level
navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task
performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion
commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to
prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation
methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating
erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world
validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and
effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a
scalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex,
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续时间多智能体路径规划中CCBS算法的非终止性和次优解问题。

Method: 引入分析框架，提出新分支规则并验证其满足健全和终止条件。

Result: 新分支规则在实验中表现优于标准CCBS，提供更低的总成本解。

Conclusion: 新分支规则成功修复CCBS问题，分析框架为未来类似算法评估提供系统方法。

Abstract: Continuous-time Conflict Based-Search (CCBS) has long been viewed as the
de-facto optimal solver for multi-agent path finding in continuous time
(MAPFR). Recent findings, however, show that the original theoretical variant
of CCBS can suffer from non-termination, while the widely used implementation
can return sub-optimal solutions. We introduce an analytical framework that
yields simple and sufficient conditions under which any CCBS-style algorithm is
both sound, i.e., returns only optimal solutions, and solution complete, i.e.,
terminates on every solvable MAPFR instance. Investigating the publicly
available implementation of CCBS reveals that it violates these conditions.
Though this merely indicates that CCBS might be unsound, this indication is
supported by counter-examples.
  Leveraging the analytical framework, we propose a novel branching rule and
prove that it satisfies the sufficient conditions, thereby restoring soundness
and termination guarantees. Consequently, the resulting CCBS variant is both
sound and solution complete, matching the guarantees of the discrete-time CBS
for the first time in the continuous domain. We experimentally apply standard
CCBS and CCBS under our branching rule to an example problem, with our
branching rule returning a solution with lower sum-of-costs than standard CCBS.
Because the branching rule largely only affects the branching step, it can be
adopted as a drop-in replacement in existing code-bases, as we show in our
provided implementation. Beyond CCBS, the analytical framework and termination
criterion provide a systematic way to evaluate other CCBS-like MAPFR solvers
and future extensions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: BOGA方法从梯度回波采集扩展到TSE成像，用于7T磁场下获取均匀的T1、T2和质子密度加权图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决7T磁场下TSE成像中的不均匀性问题，尤其是由射频场不均匀性引起的对比度变化。

Method: 通过采集多组互补射频模式和扫描参数的TSE图像，利用BOGA方法处理数据以消除不均匀性影响。

Result: 成功获得均匀的T1、T2和质子密度加权图像，且不受TSE因子的影响。

Conclusion: BOGA方法的TSE应用可在7T磁场下获得均匀的对比度，无需额外数据采集。

Abstract: Purpose: Bilateral Orthogonality Generative Acquisitions (BOGA) method, which
was initially implemented for T_2^* contrast via gradient echo acquisitions, is
adapted for TSE imaging at 7T using parallel transmission (pTx) system for
obtaining homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images. Theory and
Methods: Multiple TSE images with complimentary RF modes and scan parameters
are acquired as input images for the BOGA method where RF modes have
complimentary transmit and receive field inhomogeneity patterns and scan
parameters have varying echo and repetition times. With the application of the
BOGA method using different subsets of the data acquisitions for each contrast,
homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density contrast in the final images obtained.
Furthermore, to demonstrate the effect of the TSE factor, two TSE factors are
used individually. Normalized intensity profiles and signal to noise ratio maps
are utilized for the comparison of the CP mode images and the TSE factors
respectively.
  Results: Homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images are obtained
with the TSE implementation of the BOGA method without the transmit and receive
field inhomogeneity effects. Furthermore, mixed contrast effects of the TSE
acquisition are simultaneously resolved independently of the TSE factor.
  Conclusion: TSE application of BOGA method results in homogeneous T_1, T_2
and proton density contrasts at 7T, as the inhomogeneity effects are removed
from the final contrast without any prior data acquisitions.

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial
fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE
reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

Conclusion: 因果感知的深度学习框架能够有效提升波束对齐的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

<details>

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在虚假前提指令（引用不存在的对象或条件）下表现不足，需改进其识别与响应能力。

Method: 提出IVA框架：检测不可执行指令、语言修正、基于感知和动作的替代方案。通过半合成数据集训练模型。

Result: IVA将虚假前提检测准确率提升97.56%，虚假前提场景下的成功响应率提高50.78%。

Conclusion: IVA框架显著提升了VLA模型处理虚假前提指令的能力，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is a major global health concern, requiring advancements in
robotic surgery and diagnostics to improve patient outcomes. A phantom is a
specially designed object that simulates human tissues or organs. It can be
used for calibrating and testing a medical process, as well as for training and
research purposes. Existing prostate phantoms fail to simulate dynamic
scenarios. This paper presents a pneumatically actuated prostate phantom with
multiple independently controlled chambers, allowing for precise volumetric
adjustments to replicate asymmetric and symmetric benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH). The phantom is designed based on shape analysis of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) datasets, modeled with finite element method (FEM), and validated
through 3D reconstruction. The simulation results showed strong agreement with
physical measurements, achieving average errors of 3.47% in forward modeling
and 1.41% in inverse modeling. These results demonstrate the phantom's
potential as a platform for validating robotic-assisted systems and for further
development toward realistic simulation-based medical training.

Result: 在SHOWMe基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在HO3D数据集上展示了对未见物体类别的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HOSt3R是一种鲁棒且通用的手-物体3D重建方法，显著提升了现有技术的性能。

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Motivation: 随着小型无人机系统（sUAS）在复杂和陌生环境中的部署增加，精确的环境数字孪生（EDT）对安全飞行和高级任务执行至关重要。然而，实际部署中引入的不确定性需要强大的验证流程来确保地形模型的可靠性。

Method: 论文提出了一种三维验证流程，结合了测试粒度、从仿真到真实世界的过渡以及从简单到边缘条件的分析。同时，利用融合USGS数据集和卫星影像的高分辨率环境数据构建地形模型。

Conclusion: 该验证流程为EDT地形模型的实际应用提供了可靠支持，提升了sUAS在复杂环境中的任务执行能力。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) in
unfamiliar and complex environments, Environmental Digital Twins (EDT) that
comprise weather, airspace, and terrain data are critical for safe flight
planning and for maintaining appropriate altitudes during search and
surveillance operations. With the expansion of sUAS capabilities through edge
and cloud computing, accurate EDT are also vital for advanced sUAS
capabilities, like geolocation. However, real-world sUAS deployment introduces
significant sources of uncertainty, necessitating a robust validation process
for EDT components. This paper focuses on the validation of terrain models, one
of the key components of an EDT, for real-world sUAS tasks. These models are
constructed by fusing U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) datasets and satellite
imagery, incorporating high-resolution environmental data to support mission
tasks. Validating both the terrain models and their operational use by sUAS
under real-world conditions presents significant challenges, including limited
data granularity, terrain discontinuities, GPS and sensor inaccuracies, visual
detection uncertainties, as well as onboard resources and timing constraints.
We propose a 3-Dimensions validation process grounded in software engineering
principles, following a workflow across granularity of tests, simulation to
real world, and the analysis of simple to edge conditions. We demonstrate our
approach using a multi-sUAS platform equipped with a Terrain-Aware Digital
Shadow.

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC)-assisted internet of vehicle (IoV) is emerging as
a promising paradigm to provide computing services for vehicles. However,
meeting the computing-sensitive and computation-intensive demands of vehicles
poses several challenges, including the discrepancy between the limited
resource provision and stringent computing requirement, the difficulty in
capturing and integrating the intricate features of the MEC-assisted IoV system
into the problem formulation, and the need for real-time processing and
efficient resource management in the dynamic environment. In this work, we
explore the AI-enabled task offloading and resource allocation for MEC-assisted
consumer IoV systems. Specifically, we first present a multi-MEC-assisted
consumer IoV architecture that leverages the computational resources of MEC
servers to provide offloading services close to vehicles. Subsequently, we
formulate a system cost minimization optimization problem (SCMOP) by
integrating the service delay and energy consumption. To efficiently solve this
problem, we design a joint task offloading and computing resource allocation
approach (JTOCRA) by applying the multi-agent deep deterministic policy
gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed JTOCRA can achieve superior system performances and exhibits better
scalability compared to other alternative approaches.

Abstract: To increase the efficiency of future electric vehicles, it is crucial to
reduce drivetrain losses in battery-powered vehicles. This enables either an
increase in driving range or overall cost savings by reducing battery capacity
while maintaining the same range. Harmonic motor losses account for an
avoidable share of more than 30% of the total eDrive losses in standard B6-2L
300 kW iPMSM configurations. These losses result from high-frequency voltage
distortion across the motor windings, which can be reduced through various
approaches. Of great importance is the classification of cost-neutral and
low-cost concepts for loss reduction. The following presents and categorizes
approaches to loss reduction that have been developed by research and industry
in recent years. In particular, novel part-load-capable motor and inverter
concepts are introduced, which enable motor switching or multilevel operation
to reduce harmonic losses in the part-load range.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system

operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,
ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and

Motivation: 慢性呼吸道疾病（如COPD）的咳嗽声音分析对诊断有重要意义，但传统方法缺乏可解释性。本研究旨在通过XAI技术，提供一种透明且可解释的分析方法。

Method: 使用CNN训练咳嗽信号的时频表示，并通过遮挡图定位频谱图的诊断相关区域，随后分解为五个频带进行特征提取和分析。

Result: 研究发现，不同频带的频谱模式在疾病组间存在差异，该方法能够区分COPD和其他呼吸系统疾病，以及慢性与非慢性患者组。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了咳嗽声学的病理生理特征，证明了XAI在生物医学信号分析和呼吸疾病诊断中的价值。

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation
and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be
retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart
factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring
systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work
presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning
model development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing
and classification pipeline on a microcontroller. After a short review on
TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes
dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for
structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the
development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with
12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at
15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex
M4F microcontroller, serving as a reference for future TinyML process
monitoring solutions.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于可重构天线阵列的三混合波束成形架构，通过优化算法实现频谱效率和能量效率的最大化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统波束成形技术在频谱效率和能量效率上的限制，提出了三混合波束成形架构，结合数字、模拟和电磁波束成形技术。

Method: 提出了三循环交替优化方案，分别优化数字和模拟波束成形器，并通过坐标下降法确定RC选择。此外，还开发了基于双二次变换的分数规划方案。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该架构在频谱效率和能量效率上均有显著提升，且提出的复杂度优化方案性能损失较小。

Conclusion: RCRAA在提升波束成形性能方面具有潜力，同时通过优化算法显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a tri-hybrid beamforming (THBF) architecture based
on the radiation-center (RC) reconfigurable antenna array (RCRAA), including
the digital beamforming, analog beamforming, and electromagnetic (EM)
beamforming, where the EM beamformer design is modeled as RC selection. Aiming
at spectral efficiency (SE) maximization subject to the hardware and power
consumption constraints, we propose a tri-loop alternating optimization (TLAO)
scheme for the THBF design, where the digital and analog beamformers are
optimized based on the penalty dual decomposition in the inner and middle
loops, and the RC selection is determined through the coordinate descent method
in the outer loop. Aiming at energy-efficiency (EE) maximization, we develop a
dual quadratic transform-based fractional programming (DQTFP) scheme, where the
TLAO scheme is readily used for the THBF design. To reduce the computational
complexity, we propose the Lagrange dual transform-based fractional programming
(LDTFP) scheme, where each iteration has a closed-form solution. Simulation
results demonstrate the great potential of the RCRAA in improving both SE and
EE. Compared to the DQTFP scheme, the LDTFP scheme significantly reduces the
computational complexity with only minor performance loss.
