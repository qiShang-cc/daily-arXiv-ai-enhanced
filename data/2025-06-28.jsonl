By\nintroducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,\nCHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2\nlayers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight\nTransformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,\nmaking them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional\nshallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep\nTransformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This\nrepresents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms\nin wireless receivers with limited computational resources."}

To address these challenges, we introduce\nMedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language\nModel (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional\nNeural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM\ninterprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically\nroute task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids\nretraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific\nweights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated\nMedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging\nmodalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting\nand executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of\n2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab\nachieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and\nstrong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,\nMedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the\ninterpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs."}

The method achieves computational efficiency by exploiting a\ndistinctive property of satellite MIMO channels: users within the same\ngeographical cluster exhibit highly correlated channel characteristics due to\ntheir physical proximity, which typically impedes convergence in conventional\niterative MIMO detectors. The proposed method implements a two-stage strategy\nthat first eliminates intra-cluster interference using computationally\nefficient small matrix inversions, then utilizes these pre-computed matrices to\naccelerate standard iterative MIMO detectors such as Gauss-Seidel (GS) and\nsymmetric successive over-relaxation (SSOR) for effective inter-cluster\ninterference cancellation. Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod achieves more than 12 times faster convergence under perfect channel\nstate information. Even when accounting for channel estimation errors, the\nmethod maintains 9 times faster convergence, demonstrating its robustness and\neffectiveness for next-generation satellite MIMO communications."}

This research\ninvestigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal\nprocessing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem\nin low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)\nMel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with\na Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered\nsubset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based\non speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN\narchitecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and\nstrong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the\nWavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These\nfindings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with\nconvolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working\nwith limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to\ndataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,\nproviding a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further\nimprovement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of\nself-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural\narchitectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong\nbaseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within\nresource-constrained environments."}
