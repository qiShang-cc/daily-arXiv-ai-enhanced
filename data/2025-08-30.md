### [1] [Error Analysis for Over-the-Air Federated Learning under Misaligned and Time-Varying Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20277)
*Xiaoyan Ma,Shahryar Zehtabi,Taejoon Kim,Christopher G. Brinton*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于OFDM的空中联邦学习（OTA-FL）系统，分析了高移动性设备导致的信道估计不准确和模型参数传输不同步问题，提出了量化这些影响的闭式解，并通过仿真验证了理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高移动性设备（如无人机）在OTA-FL系统中会导致信道估计不准确和模型参数传输不同步，这些问题对联邦学习训练过程的影响尚未深入研究。

Method: 作者首先针对单轮全局模型更新推导了闭环表达式，量化信道不完美的影响；随后扩展到多轮全局更新，分析了累积误差的界限。

Result: 理论分析通过数值仿真验证，结果表明信道不完美会显著影响OTA-FL的性能。

Conclusion: 本文为OTA-FL系统中由高移动性引起的信道和同步问题提供了理论分析框架，为后续优化设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates an OFDM-based over-the-air federated learning
(OTA-FL) system, where multiple mobile devices, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs), transmit local machine learning (ML) models to a central parameter
server (PS) for global model aggregation. The high mobility of local devices
results in imperfect channel estimation, leading to a misalignment problem,
i.e., the model parameters transmitted from different local devices do not
arrive at the central PS simultaneously. Moreover, the mobility introduces
time-varying uploading channels, which further complicates the aggregation
process. All these factors collectively cause distortions in the OTA-FL
training process which are underexplored. To quantify these effects, we first
derive a closed-form expression for a single-round global model update in terms
of these channel imperfections. We then extend our analysis to capture multiple
rounds of global updates, yielding a bound on the accumulated error in OTA-FL.
We validate our theoretical results via extensive numerical simulations, which
corroborate our derived analysis.

### [2] [Dual-IRS Aided Near-/Hybrid-Field SWIPT: Passive Beamforming and Independent Antenna Power Splitting Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20531)
*Chaoying Huang,Wen Chen,Qingqing Wu,Xusheng Zhu,Zhendong Li,Ying Wang,Jinhong Yuan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型双智能反射面（IRS）辅助的干扰受限同时无线信息和能量传输（SWIPT）系统，通过独立功率分配（PS）实现信息与能量的优化平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过双IRS和独立PS技术，在近场和混合场信道模型中优化SWIPT系统的性能，以提升能量收集效率。

Method: 在近场情况下，采用交替优化算法结合拉格朗日对偶和DC编程；在混合场情况下，通过分析信道增益不变性转换为凸优化问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，提出的双IRS辅助SWIPT系统在独立PS下优于其他基准方案。

Conclusion: 双IRS和独立PS技术在SWIPT系统中表现优越，尤其在近场和混合场模型中具有显著性能增益。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dual-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided
interference-limited simultaneous wireless information and power transfer
(SWIPT) system with independent power splitting (PS), where each receiving
antenna applies different PS factors to offer an advantageous trade-off between
the useful information and harvested energy. We separately establish the near-
and hybrid-field channel models for IRS-reflected links to evaluate the
performance gain more precisely and practically. Specifically, we formulate an
optimization problem of maximizing the harvested power by jointly optimizing
dual-IRS phase shifts, independent PS ratio, and receive beamforming vector in
both near- and hybrid-field cases. In the near-field case, the alternating
optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex problem by applying
the Lagrange duality method and the difference-of-convex (DC) programming. In
the hybrid-field case, we first present an interesting result that the
AP-IRS-user channel gains are invariant to the phase shifts of dual-IRS, which
allows the optimization problem to be transformed into a convex one. Then, we
derive the asymptotic performance of the combined channel gains in closed-form
and analyze the characteristics of the dual-IRS. Numerical results validate our
analysis and indicate the performance gains of the proposed scheme that
dual-IRS-aided SWIPT with independent PS over other benchmark schemes.

### [3] [Towards Automated EEG-Based Detection Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20535)
*Annika Stiehl,Nicolas Weeger,Christian Uhl,Dominic Bechtold,Nicole Ille,Stefan Geißelsöder*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种深度卷积自编码器（DCAE），结合时间和频域信息用于癫痫脑电图（EEG）特征提取，优化了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫诊断依赖于EEG监测，但传统人工分析方法耗时且缺乏自动化特征，现有的深度学习方法难以兼顾高灵敏度和低误报率。

Method: 使用DCAE提取EEG的低维潜在表示，通过比较时间和频域的重构误差评估模型性能。

Result: 结合时间和频域损失的DCAE模型表现最佳，表明单一表示无法充分保留信号特征。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合多域信息的深度学习模型能更有效处理EEG数据，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. This disease
requires reliable and efficient seizure detection methods.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for seizure monitoring, but
its manual analysis is a time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge. In
addition, there are no well-defined features that allow fully automated
analysis. Existing deep learning-based approaches struggle to achieve high
sensitivity while maintaining a low false alarm rate per hour (FAR/h) and lack
consistency in the optimal EEG input representation, whether in the time or
frequency domain. To address these issues, we propose a Deep Convolutional
Autoencoder (DCAE) to extract low-dimensional latent representations that
preserve essential EEG signal features. The ability of the model to preserve
relevant information was evaluated by comparing reconstruction errors based on
both time series and frequency-domain representations. Several autoencoders
with different loss functions based on time and frequency were trained and
evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reconstructing EEG features. Our
results show that the DCAE model taking both time series and frequency losses
into account achieved the best reconstruction performance. This indicates that
Deep Neural Networks with a single representation might not preserve the
relevant signal properties. This work provides insight into how deep learning
models process EEG data and examines whether frequency information is captured
when time series signals are used as input.

### [4] [Removing motion artifacts from mechanomyographic signals: an innovative filtering method applied to human movement analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20602)
*Matthieu Correa,Nicolas Vignais,Isabelle A. Siegler,Maxime Projetti*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CEEMDAN和谱模糊熵的自适应滤波方法，用于动态条件下MMG信号的运动伪迹分离，效果优于传统带通滤波。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MMG在运动中易受伪迹干扰，限制了其实际应用，需要更有效的滤波方法。

Method: 采用CEEMDAN结合自适应噪声和谱模糊熵的方法，动态过滤MMG加速度信号中的运动伪迹。

Result: 新方法在三角肌和竖脊肌的运动重构中表现优于传统滤波（R²=0.907和0.842）。

Conclusion: 新方法在5-20Hz带宽内动态过滤伪迹效果显著，但对躯干和下肢肌肉信号需谨慎解释。

Abstract: Mechanomyography (MMG) is a promising tool for measuring muscle activity in
the field but its sensitivity to motion artifacts limits its application. In
this study, we proposed an adaptative filtering method for MMG accelerometers
based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition, with adaptative
noise and spectral fuzzy entropy, to isolate motions artefacts from the MMG
signal in dynamic conditions. We compared our method with the traditional
band-pass filtering technique, demonstrating better results concerning motion
recomposition for deltoid and erector spinae muscles (R${}^2$ = 0.907 and
0.842). Thus, this innovative method allows the filtering of motion artifacts
dynamically in the 5-20 Hz bandwidth, which is not achievable with traditional
method. However, the interpretation of accelerometric MMG signals from the
trunk and lower-limb muscles during walking or running should be approached
with great caution as impact-related accelerations are still present, though
their exact quantity still needs to be quantified.

### [5] [Weighted Bayesian Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao Bound for Mixed-Resolution Parameter Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20761)
*Yaniv Mazor,Tirza Routtenberg*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了混合分辨率系统中的参数估计问题，提出了加权贝叶斯克拉美罗界(WBCRB)及其近似MSE的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合分辨率系统（结合高分辨率与粗量化数据）在通信和雷达系统中广泛应用，但粗量化数据引入参数估计的权衡问题，需要新的理论工具。

Method: 开发了基于一般权重函数的WBCRB，并将其应用于分区估计问题，提出了一种新的MSE近似方法。

Result: 在LGO模型中验证了WBCRB优于经典BCRB，且基于WBCRB的MSE近似更精确，能预测量化误差下的非单调行为。

Conclusion: WBCRB及其近似方法为混合分辨率系统中的参数估计提供了更准确的理论分析和工具。

Abstract: Mixed-resolution architectures, combining high-resolution (analog) data with
coarsely quantized (e.g., 1-bit) data, are widely employed in emerging
communication and radar systems to reduce hardware costs and power consumption.
However, the use of coarsely quantized data introduces non-trivial tradeoffs in
parameter estimation tasks. In this paper, we investigate the derivation of
lower bounds for such systems. In particular, we develop the weighted Bayesian
Cramer-Rao bound (WBCRB) for the mixed-resolution setting with a general weight
function. We demonstrate the special cases of: (i) the classical BCRB; (ii) the
WBCRB that is based on the Bayesian Fisher information matrix (BFIM)-Inverse
weighting; and (iii) the Aharon-Tabrikian tightest WBCRB with an optimal weight
function. Based on the developed WBCRB, we propose a new method to approximate
the mean-squared-error (MSE) by partitioning the estimation problem into two
regions: (a) where the 1-bit quantized data is informative; and (b) where it is
saturated. We apply region-specific WBCRB approximations in these regions to
achieve an accurate composite MSE estimate. We derive the bounds and MSE
approximation for the linear Gaussian orthonormal (LGO) model, which is
commonly used in practical signal processing applications. Our simulation
results demonstrate the use of the proposed bounds and approximation method in
the LGO model with a scalar unknown parameter. It is shown that the WBCRB
outperforms the BCRB, where the BFIM-Inverse weighting version approaches the
optimal WBCRB. Moreover, it is shown that the WBCRB-based MSE approximation is
tighter and accurately predicts the non-monotonic behavior of the MSE in the
presence of quantization errors.

### [6] [Breaking Barriers in Health Monitoring: Multi-Scenario Vital Sign Detection Using Mm-Wave MIMO FMCW Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20864)
*Ehsan Sadeghi,Paul Havinga*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文探讨了毫米波FMCW雷达在多种场景下用于生命体征检测的部署，通过改进信号处理技术克服传统方法的局限，引入适应Prony和MUSIC算法，显著提升了非接触监测的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生命体征监测方法存在局限性，研究旨在通过毫米波雷达技术提供更可靠的非接触式解决方案，特别是在临床和紧急场景中。

Method: 采用了Prony和MUSIC算法的改进版本，专注于实时心率和呼吸率监测，并有效抑制噪声和谐波干扰。

Result: 结果显示，MUSIC和Prony在心率和呼吸率检测中的平均绝对误差分别为1.8/0.81和1.01/0.8，证明了其高准确性和实用性。

Conclusion: FMCW雷达在非接触生命体征监测中表现出色，有望成为临床和紧急场景中的可靠工具。

Abstract: This paper explores the deployment of mm-wave Frequency Modulated Continuous
Wave (FMCW) radar for vital sign detection across multiple scenarios. We focus
on overcoming the limitations of traditional sensing methods by enhancing
signal processing techniques to capture subtle physiological changes
effectively. Our study introduces novel adaptations of the Prony and MUSIC
algorithms tailored for real-time heart and respiration rate monitoring,
significantly advancing the accuracy and reliability of non-contact vital sign
monitoring using radar technologies. Notably, these algorithms demonstrate a
robust ability to suppress noise and harmonic interference. For instance, the
mean absolute errors (MAE) for MUSIC and Prony in heart rate detection are 1.8
and 0.81, respectively, while for respiration rate, the MAEs are 1.01 and 0.8,
respectively. These results underscore the potential of FMCW radar as a
reliable, non-invasive solution for continuous vital sign monitoring in
healthcare settings, particularly in clinical and emergency scenarios where
traditional contact-based monitoring is impractical.

*Hong-Yan Zhang,Haoting Liu,Rui-Jia Lin,Yu Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文分析了SGMD方法的局限性，并通过引入回拉定理修复了其缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGMD方法虽然强大，但其原有的对角平均原则（DAP）未随轨迹矩阵形式更新而改进，存在局限性。

Method: 使用回拉定理重新计算时间序列分量，解决了SGMD方法中的缺陷。

Result: 通过修正DAP的不足，提升了SGMD方法的有效性和准确性。

Conclusion: 改进后的SGMD方法更适用于时间序列分解，解决了原有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) is a powerful method for
decomposing time series, which is based on the diagonal averaging principle
(DAP) inherited from the singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Although the authors
of SGMD method generalized the form of the trajectory matrix in SSA, the DAP is
not updated simultaneously. In this work, we pointed out the limitations of the
SGMD method and fixed the bugs with the pulling back theorem for computing the
given component of time series from the corresponding component of trajectory
matrix.

### [8] [Learning Fast, Tool aware Collision Avoidance for Collaborative Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20457)
*Joonho Lee,Yunho Kim,Seokjoon Kim,Quan Nguyen,Youngjin Heo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种能够实时调整工具尺寸和交互模式的碰撞避免系统，结合感知模型和强化学习策略，在动态环境中优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作机器人在动态环境中因工具变化和部分观测导致的碰撞或保守行为问题。

Method: 使用学习感知模型过滤点云中的机器人和工具部分，并结合约束强化学习的控制策略进行实时避障。

Result: 在仿真和实际测试中表现优于传统方法（APF、MPPI），同时计算成本降低60%。

Conclusion: 该系统为动态环境中的机器人提供了模块化、高效且有效的碰撞避免解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human
environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle
motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume
full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly
conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision
avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of
tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system
filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about
occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use
a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce
smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and
real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI)
in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover,
our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to
a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient,
and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments.
We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate
its practical use for safe and responsive operation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPGrasp 提出了一种实时交互式抓取合成框架，通过结合用户提示和时空上下文，显著降低延迟并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在实时交互式抓取动态物体时无法兼顾低延迟和高精度的问题。

Method: 基于 SAMv2 扩展，整合用户提示与时空上下文，实现端到端的实时抓取合成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，OCID 和 Jacquard 数据集上分别实现 90.6% 和 93.8% 的准确率，GraspNet-1Billion 上延迟降低 58.5%。

Conclusion: SPGrasp 成功解决了动态抓取合成中的延迟-交互性权衡问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in
interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively
resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code

### [10] [SimShear: Sim-to-Real Shear-based Tactile Servoing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20561)
*Kipp McAdam Freud,Yijiong Lin,Nathan F. Lepora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimShear通过sim-to-real的触觉控制管道，允许使用剪切信息而无需在模拟中明确建模剪切动力学。该方法在触觉图像模拟和姿态/剪切预测上优于基线pix2pix方法，并在两个控制任务中验证了可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪切动力学在动态物体交互任务中至关重要，但模拟剪切仍具有挑战性。研究旨在通过sim-to-real方法解决这一问题。

Method: 引入shPix2pix，一种剪切条件的U-Net GAN，将不含剪切信息的模拟触觉图像与剪切信息向量转换为包含剪切变形的真实图像。

Result: SimShear在触觉图像模拟和姿态/剪切预测上表现优于基线方法，并成功应用于两个触觉控制任务，保持接触误差在1-2毫米内。

Conclusion: 研究验证了通过刚性体模拟器实现sim-to-real剪切建模的可行性，为触觉机器人的模拟研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that enables
the use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in
simulation. Shear, arising from lateral movements across contact surfaces, is
critical for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but remains
challenging to simulate. To address this, we introduce shPix2pix, a
shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated tactile images absent of
shear, together with a vector encoding shear information, into realistic
equivalents with shear deformations. This method outperforms baseline pix2pix
approaches in simulating tactile images and in pose/shear prediction. We apply
SimShear to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms
equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: (i) a tactile tracking task, where
a follower arm tracks a surface moved by a leader arm, and (ii) a collaborative
co-lifting task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader
follows a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintains contact errors within 1
to 2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential, validating
the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators and
opening new directions for simulation in tactile robotics.

*TianChen Huang,Wei Gao,Runchen Xu,Shiwu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出一种分阶段框架，结合XCoM/LIPM步态模板和轻量级规划器，实现人形机器人在狭窄梁上的稳定行走。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人在稀疏、安全性高的接触环境下难以稳定行走的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段在平坦地面训练稳健的步态跟踪；第二阶段在模拟梁上训练高层规划器调整步态以优化安全性和精确性。

Result: 系统能在0.2米宽、3米长的梁上稳定行走，表现优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 分阶段设计和模块化接口提高了成功率和模拟到现实的迁移能力。

Abstract: Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse,
safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We
propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM
footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level
tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly
follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic
footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable
contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in
simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual
(Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template
step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while
preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and
consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,
forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a
Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across
simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms
template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence,
and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent
analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,
high-risk industrial environments.

Abstract: Enabling multiple autonomous machines to perform reliably requires the
development of efficient cooperative control algorithms. This paper presents a
survey of algorithms that have been developed for controlling and coordinating
autonomous machines in complex environments. We especially focus on task
allocation methods using computational intelligence (CI) and deep reinforcement

analysed thoroughly. We also propose and discuss in detail various future
research directions that shed light on how to improve existing algorithms or
create new methods to enhance the employability and performance of autonomous

methods provide viable approaches to addressing complex task allocation
problems in dynamic and uncertain environments. The recent development of deep
RL has greatly contributed to the literature on controlling and coordinating
autonomous machines, and it has become a growing trend in this area. It is
envisaged that this paper will provide researchers and engineers with a
comprehensive overview of progress in machine learning research related to
autonomous machines. It also highlights underexplored areas, identifies
emerging methodologies, and suggests new avenues for exploration in future
research within this domain.

Motivation: 由于全球熟练工人数量减少，需要研究如何将专家技能转移到机器人上。现有模仿学习方法多依赖位置和力数据，但难以根据人类意图灵活调整任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为技能转移提供了灵活性和适应性，拓展了机器人的任务变更能力。

Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal
with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been
researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called
imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data,
but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and
reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the
framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning
methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change
tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by
conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible
motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The
proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and
skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF
calligraphy robot.

Result: 实验表明，UA-PCBFs在任务关键指标上优于现有技术，显著减少了机器人安全空间被侵犯的次数。

Conclusion: UA-PCBFs框架通过更智能的预测和规划，提升了人机交互的流畅性和安全性，为复杂环境下的协作提供了新思路。

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fabric-based thermal-haptic interface for virtual
reality and teleoperation. It integrates pneumatic actuation and conductive
fabric with an innovative ultra-lightweight design, achieving only 2~g for each
finger unit. By embedding heating elements within textile pneumatic chambers,
the system delivers modulated pressure and thermal stimuli to fingerpads
through a fully soft, wearable interface.
  Comprehensive characterization demonstrates rapid thermal modulation with
heating rates up to 3$^{\circ}$C/s, enabling dynamic thermal feedback for
virtual or teleoperation interactions. The pneumatic subsystem generates forces
up to 8.93~N at 50~kPa, while optimization of fingerpad-actuator clearance
enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental
validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature
identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and
significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks.
Results show enhanced success rates (88.5\% to 96.4\%, p = 0.029) and improved
force control precision (p = 0.013) when haptic feedback is enabled, validating
the effectiveness of the integrated thermal-haptic approach for advanced
human-machine interaction applications.

Abstract: In a recent effort, we successfully proposed a categorically novel approach
to mimic the phenomenoa of hovering and source seeking by flapping insects and
hummingbirds using a new extremum seeking control (ESC) approach. Said ESC
approach was shown capable of characterizing the physics of hovering and source

Conclusion: 该架构为未来的全身控制和物理人机交互研究提供了可靠平台。

Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant
challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system
reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome
these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with
custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3%
through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel,
daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common
wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based
systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels
across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS,
confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's
efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's
open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that
slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the
robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully
manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a
robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced
whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.

Result: PEWM实现了细粒度语言与动作对齐，降低了学习复杂度，提升了数据效率，并支持复杂任务的组合泛化。

Conclusion: PEWM通过结合视频模型的时空先验和VLM的语义意识，为可扩展、可解释的通用具身智能铺平了道路。

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Result: GIT*在R^4到R^16问题中表现优于现有单查询采样规划器，并在实际移动操作任务中验证。

Conclusion: GIT*通过复杂数据整合和算法优化，显著提升路径规划性能。

Abstract: Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a
start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic
functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve
search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook
available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the
complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed
Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a
wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and
the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better
guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP),
which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate
genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of
data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality
within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses
existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to
R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task. A video

Conclusion: LIT*在机器人运动规划中表现出色，适用于高维环境和实际机器人任务。

Abstract: Efficient motion planning algorithms are essential in robotics. Optimizing
essential parameters, such as batch size and nearest neighbor selection in
sampling-based methods, can enhance performance in the planning process.
However, existing approaches often lack environmental adaptability. Inspired by
the method of the deep fuzzy neural networks, this work introduces
Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based deep fuzzy
learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor
parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding
both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates
between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths
and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces
demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution
quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, sampling-based planners
in environments ranging from R^8 to R^14 and is successfully validated on a
dual-arm robot manipulation task. A video showcasing our experimental results

Conclusion: CoCoL在多机器人协作学习中高效且鲁棒，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of
multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to
high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot
tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized
Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL
achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type
updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and
reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,
the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against
data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot
collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in
significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total
bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These
benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming
data, and time-varying network topologies.

Result: 在Isaac Sim中的测试表明，GODHS比传统非语义搜索策略更高效。

Conclusion: 语言增强的分层导航框架为机器人在复杂环境中搜索目标物体提供了新思路，展示了高效性和可行性。

Abstract: Enabling robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in complex,
unstructured environments is critical for diverse applications ranging from
household assistance to industrial automation. However, traditional scene
representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable
contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in
completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a
language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates
semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented
Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large
language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process
through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved
through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each
stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we
introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting
with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.
Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search
efficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies. Website

Abstract: As space exploration advances, underground environments are becoming
increasingly attractive due to their potential to provide shelter, easier

environments exist on Earth, they are often not easily accessible and do not
accurately represent the diversity of underground environments found throughout

Result: ActLoc在单视角选择和全轨迹规划中表现优异，适用于多种导航任务。

Conclusion: ActLoc通过主动视角选择显著提升了定位精度，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are
incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac,
an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing
through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural
components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities.
Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional
visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing
modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile
feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to
achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate
three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$),
material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material
dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task.
Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to
concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which
verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise

Abstract: With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring
soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or
other machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such
interactions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow
torque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while
accurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic
programming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on
accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model
mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce
Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,
probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,
without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's
proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a
prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the
unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator
driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden
changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in
static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario
where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and
dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to
changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory
system.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and
whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid
interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis
exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must
perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both
agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for
humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory
prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based
whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and
timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that
mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive
rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are
incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose
humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and
sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate
real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a
step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.

Prompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then
leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,
bringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user

cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However,
transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the
sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can
degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization
and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle
under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In
this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of
relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly
adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve
this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies
residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a
differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework
refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled
effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics
model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient
backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy
updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of
our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to
unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on
agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the
real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to
L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in
vision-based control without explicit state estimation.

Result: 单个类器官的分类准确率为61%，三器官组合提升至83%，且多器官配置显著增强了抗噪能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明类器官可用作生物混合计算元素，并提供了一种可扩展的编码框架。

Abstract: This study proposes a generalizable encoding strategy that maps tactile
sensor data to electrical stimulation patterns, enabling neural organoids to
perform an open-loop artificial tactile Braille classification task. Human
forebrain organoids cultured on a low-density microelectrode array (MEA) are
systematically stimulated to characterize the relationship between electrical
stimulation parameters (number of pulse, phase amplitude, phase duration, and
trigger delay) and organoid responses, measured as spike activity and spatial
displacement of the center of activity. Implemented on event-based tactile
inputs recorded from the Evetac sensor, our system achieved an average Braille
letter classification accuracy of 61 percent with a single organoid, which
increased significantly to 83 percent when responses from a three-organoid
ensemble were combined. Additionally, the multi-organoid configuration
demonstrated enhanced robustness against various types of artificially
introduced noise. This research demonstrates the potential of organoids as
low-power, adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements and provides a
foundational encoding framework for future scalable bio-hybrid computing
architectures.

Conclusion: HCF大规模MIMO设计在降低部署成本的同时保持了性能，是现有无蜂窝和蜂窝系统的理想替代方案。

Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive MIMO offers uniform service via distributed access
points (APs), which impose high deployment costs. A novel design called
hierarchical cell-free (HCF) addresses this problem by replacing some APs with
a central base station, thereby lowering the costs of fronthaul network
(wireless sites and fiber cables) while preserving performance. To identify the
optimal uplink configuration in HCF massive MIMO, this paper provides the first
comprehensive analysis, benchmarking it against cellular and CF systems. We
develop a unified analytical framework for spectral efficiency that supports
arbitrary combining schemes and introduce a novel hierarchical combining
approach tailored to HCF two-tier architecture. Through analysis and evaluation
of user fairness, system capacity, fronthaul requirements, and computational
complexity, this paper identifies that HCF using centralized zero-forcing
combining achieves the optimal balance between performance and cost-efficiency.

signaling, and computational complexity. Through analyses and evaluation, this
work ultimately identifies the optimal uplink technique for practical cell-free

*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Vision Transformer（ViT）的统一框架，用于自动调制识别（AMR），结合了监督、自监督和重构目标，提高了标签效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AMR解决方案通常依赖于大规模标记数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际中的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出一个整合ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器的框架；通过重构分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，以促进鲁棒的特征学习。

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，该方法在低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅需15-20%标记数据即可达到ResNet级别精度，并在不同SNR水平下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架为AMR提供了一个简单、通用且高效的标签利用解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Conclusion: SKGE-Swin架构通过Swin Transformer和跳跃机制显著提升了自动驾驶车辆的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级算法COMETH，用于实时多视角人体姿态融合，结合运动学和生物力学约束提高准确性，适合工业和安全关键应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业5.0时代，监控人体活动对安全和健康至关重要。多摄像头集中式方案计算成本高且带宽需求大，而边缘设备资源有限影响准确性。

Method: COMETH算法结合运动学和生物力学约束，采用凸优化逆运动学进行空间融合，并使用状态观察器提升时间一致性。

Result: 在公共和工业数据集上，COMETH在定位、检测和跟踪准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COMETH实现了准确且可扩展的人体运动跟踪，适合工业和安全关键应用。代码已开源。

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定时间片段分割EEG信号可能缺乏生物学意义，作者探索自适应分割方法是否有助于机器学习分析。

Method: 提出CTXSEG方法，基于EEG数据的统计学差异生成可变长度片段，并验证其在癫痫检测中的应用。

Result: CTXSEG在标准化评估框架下提升了癫痫检测性能，且需要的片段更少。

Conclusion: 自适应分割CTXSEG是一种有前景的替代方法，应纳入EEG机器学习的预处理标准流程。

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

Motivation: 解决传统采样规划器探索速度慢，而学习型方法在OOD场景中泛化性差的问题。

Result: DiTree比传统采样规划器快3倍，成功率提高30%。

Conclusion: DiTree提供了一种安全、高效的动力学运动规划解决方案。

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Abstract: This paper presents a regulation-aware motion planning framework for
autonomous racing scenarios. Each agent solves a Regulation-Compliant Model
Predictive Control problem, where racing rules - such as right-of-way and
collision avoidance responsibilities - are encoded using Mixed Logical
Dynamical constraints. We formalize the interaction between vehicles as a
Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) and approximate its solution using
an Iterative Best Response scheme. Building on this, we introduce the
Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Planner (RA-GTP), in which the attacker reasons
over the defender's regulation-constrained behavior. This game-theoretic layer
enables the generation of overtaking strategies that are both safe and
non-conservative. Simulation results demonstrate that the RA-GTP outperforms
baseline methods that assume non-interacting or rule-agnostic opponent models,
leading to more effective maneuvers while consistently maintaining compliance
with racing regulations.
