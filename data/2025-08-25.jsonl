Conventional physical-layer security solutions rely on\ndirectional beamforming or artificial noise injection implemented via signal\nprocessing in the baseband (BB) domain. However, these BB-domain approaches are\nconstrained by insufficient spatial resolution and the adverse effects of\nspatially correlated channels. To overcome these limitations, this paper\nproposes a novel secure ISAC framework empowered by compound reconfigurable\nantenna (CRA) arrays, which offer simultaneous reconfigurability of radiation\npatterns and polarization states in the electromagnetic (EM) domain.\nSpecifically, we develop a comprehensive channel model incorporating virtual\nangular domain, spatial domain, and depolarization effects, and formulate a\nmixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly design EM-domain\nand BB-domain precoders and combiners. To efficiently solve this complex\noptimization problem, we propose an iterative decomposition-based algorithm\nleveraging fractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM),\nsecond-order cone programming (SOCP), and penalty methods. Extensive simulation\nresults demonstrate that the CRA array architecture with proposed joint EM-and\nBB-domain design achieves significant performance improvements in secure ISAC\nsystems. In particular, radar sensing gains of up to 12dB are observed over\nconventional beamforming, while robust communication security is maintained.\nThese results highlight the considerable benefits attainable by jointly\nleveraging additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the EM domain for secure\nISAC system design."}

As additional observations become available,\nwe incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the\ndiffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose\nestimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global\nconsistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations\nare further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent\n3DGS field.

It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns\nlinked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through\nthe motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is\npresented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)\ntasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and\nindividual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very\ndifficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability\namong individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method\nfor classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently\nwith Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear\nclassifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.\nFurthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nand Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was\nproposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features\nachieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower\ncomputational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance\nof the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values\nof 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The\nfindings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor\nimagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and\nclassification of MI-EEG."}
