Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: InverTwin 是一个优化驱动的框架，通过双向交互提升射频数字孪生（RF DT）的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统射频模拟器的单向性限制了数字孪生在射频传感应用中的潜力。

Result: 实验证明 InverTwin 在数据驱动和模型驱动的射频传感系统中具有多功能性和高效性。

Conclusion: InverTwin 提供了一种有效的双向交互方法，为射频数字孪生的实际应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), virtual simulated replicas of physical scenes, are
transforming various industries. However, their potential in radio frequency
(RF) sensing applications has been limited by the unidirectional nature of
conventional RF simulators. In this paper, we present InverTwin, an
optimization-driven framework that creates RF digital twins by enabling
bidirectional interaction between virtual and physical realms. InverTwin
overcomes the fundamental differentiability challenges of RF optimization
problems through novel design components, including path-space differentiation
to address discontinuity in complex simulation functions, and a radar surrogate
model to mitigate local non-convexity caused by RF signal periodicity. These
techniques enable smooth gradient propagation and robust optimization of the DT
model. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate InverTwin's versatility
and effectiveness in augmenting both data-driven and model-driven RF sensing
systems for DT reconstruction.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持性能的同时增强了可解释性和稳定性，适用于MRI去噪。

Abstract: Regularization for denoising in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically
achieved using convex regularization functions. Recently, deep learning
techniques have been shown to provide superior denoising performance. However,
this comes at the price of lack of explainability, interpretability and
stability, which are all crucial to MRI. In this work, we present a
constructive approach for designing weakly-convex regularization functions for
MR image denoising. We show that our technique performs on par with
state-of-the-art denoisers for diffusion-weighted MR image denoising. Our
technique can be applied to design weakly-convex convolutional neural networks
with prototype activation functions that impart interpretability and are
provably convergent. We also show that our technique exhibits fewer denoising
artifacts by demonstrating its effect on brain microstructure modelling.

### [3] [Pinching-Antenna Systems-Enabled Multi-User Communications: Transmission Structures and Beamforming Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14458)
*Jingjing Zhao,Haowen Song,Xidong Mu,Kaiquan Cai,Yanbo Zhu,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) enhance wireless communications through dynamic reconfigurations, proposing three transmission structures (WM, WD, WS) and solving max-min fairness problems with PDD-based algorithms, showing significant performance improvements over conventional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve wireless communications by enabling reliable line-of-sight and dynamic antenna reconfigurations in multi-user scenarios.

Method: Propose three transmission structures (WM, WD, WS) and design joint baseband signal processing and pinching beamforming, using PDD-based algorithms for solving max-min fairness problems.

Result: PASS outperforms conventional systems; WS suits unicast, WM suits multicast, and WD's performance gap with WM reduces with geographically isolated users.

Conclusion: PASS significantly enhances wireless communication performance, with specific structures optimal for different communication scenarios.

Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) represent an innovative advancement in
flexible-antenna technologies, aimed at significantly improving wireless
communications by ensuring reliable line-of-sight connections and dynamic
antenna array reconfigurations. To employ multi-waveguide PASS in multi-user
communications, three practical transmission structures are proposed, namely
waveguide multiplexing (WM), waveguide division (WD), and waveguide switching
(WS). Based on the proposed structures, the joint baseband signal processing
and pinching beamforming design is studied for a general multi-group multicast
communication system, with the unicast communication encompassed as a special
case. A max-min fairness problem is formulated for each proposed transmission
structure, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. For WM, to solve
the highly-coupled and non-convex MMF problem with complex exponential and
fractional expressions, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is
invoked for obtaining locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the augmented
Lagrangian relaxation is first applied to alleviate the stringent coupling
constraints, which is followed by the block decomposition over the resulting
augmented Lagrangian function. Then, the proposed PDD-based algorithm is
extended to solve the MMF problem for both WD and WS. Furthermore, a
low-complexity algorithm is proposed for the unicast case employing the WS
structure, by simultaneously aligning the signal phases and minimizing the
large-scale path loss at each user. Finally, numerical results reveal that: 1)
the MMF performance is significantly improved by employing the PASS compared to
conventional fixed-position antenna systems; 2) WS and WM are suitable for
unicast and multicast communications, respectively; 3) the performance gap
between WD and WM can be significantly alleviated when the users are
geographically isolated.

Abstract: This paper presents a variable bit-width fixed-point fast divider using
Goldschmidt division algorithm and Mitchell multiplication algorithm. Described
using Verilog HDL and implemented on a Xilinx XC7Z020-2CLG400I FPGA, the
proposed divider achieves over 99% computational accuracy with a minimum
latency of 99.1 ns, which is 31.7 ns faster than existing single-precision
dividers. Compared with a Goldschmidt divider using a Vedic multiplier, the
proposed design reduces Slice Registers by 46.68%, Slice LUTs by 4.93%, and
Slices by 11.85%, with less than 1% accuracy loss and only 24.1 ns additional
delay. These results demonstrate an improved balance between computational
speed and resource utilization, making the divider well-suited for
high-performance FPGA-based systems with strict resource constraints.

Conclusion: 该放大器在恶劣环境下表现出优异的线性度和稳定性，适合高精度应用。

Abstract: This paper presents a Gm-C dynamic amplifier with high linearity and high
temperature and power supply voltage stability. The main part of the amplifier
employs two asymmetric differential pairs to enhance transconductance
linearity. The amplifier maintains a nearly constant gain within a differential
input range of -40 mV to 40 mV, and achieves a total harmonic distortion (THD)
of 70.5 dB. The bias part of the amplifier adopts a constant-gm bias circuit,
which improves the temperature and supply voltage stability of the amplifier's
transconductance and gain. When the differential input is 1 mV, the power
supply voltage fluctuates by $\pm$10%, and the temperature varies between
-40$\mathrm{^\circ C}$ and 120$\mathrm{^\circ C}$, the standard deviation of
the gain distribution is 262m, and the distribution range is from 15.1 to 16.3.

Conclusion: 该数据驱动的相位定位方法在实际场景中具有可行性和鲁棒性，为下一代无线系统提供了重要支持。

Abstract: High-precision localization turns into a crucial added value and asset for
next-generation wireless systems. Carrier phase positioning (CPP) enables
sub-meter to centimeter-level accuracy and is gaining interest in 5G-Advanced
standardization. While CPP typically complements time-of-arrival (ToA)
measurements, recent literature has introduced a phase-only positioning
approach in a distributed antenna/MIMO system context with minimal bandwidth
requirements, using deep learning (DL) when operating under ideal hardware
assumptions. In more practical scenarios, however, antenna failures can largely
degrade the performance. In this paper, we address the challenging phase-only
positioning task, and propose a new DL-based localization approach harnessing
the so-called hyperbola intersection principle, clearly outperforming the
previous methods. Additionally, we consider and propose a processing and
learning mechanism that is robust to antenna element failures. Our results show
that the proposed DL model achieves robust and accurate positioning despite
antenna impairments, demonstrating the viability of data-driven,
impairment-tolerant phase-only positioning mechanisms. Comprehensive set of
numerical results demonstrates large improvements in localization accuracy
against the prior art methods.

Conclusion: 全双工近场ISAC能够高效实现通信与感知目标，为未来无线网络提供了一种可行方案。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is a promising technology for
future wireless networks, enabling simultaneous communication and sensing using
shared resources. This paper investigates the performance of full-duplex (FD)
communication in near-field ISAC systems, where spherical-wave propagation
introduces unique beam-focusing capabilities. We propose a joint optimization
framework for transmit and receive beamforming at the base station to minimize
transmit power while satisfying rate constraints for multi-user downlink
transmission, multi-user uplink reception, and multi-target sensing. Our
approach employs alternating optimization combined with semidefinite relaxation
and Rayleigh quotient techniques to address the non-convexity of the problem.
Simulation results demonstrate that FD-enabled near-field ISAC achieves
superior power efficiency compared to half-duplex and far-field benchmarks,
effectively detecting targets at identical angles while meeting communication
requirements.

### [8] [Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Routing for Heterogeneous Multi-Hop Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14884)
*Brian Kim,Justin H. Kong,Terrence J. Moore,Fikadu T. Dagefu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度Q网络（DQN）的路由框架，用于异构多跳无线网络，通过改进邻居节点选择策略和DNN估计Q值，提高路由的可扩展性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Q学习在多跳异构网络中存在可扩展性差和泛化能力不足的问题，需要一种更高效的路由方法。

Method: 采用DQN框架，结合DNN估计Q值，并基于信道增益和速率选择邻居节点。

Result: DQN方法优于基准方案，性能接近最优方案。

Conclusion: 所提方法在异构网络中具有更好的路由性能和适应性。

Abstract: Routing in multi-hop wireless networks is a complex problem, especially in
heterogeneous networks where multiple wireless communication technologies
coexist. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as Q-learning, have been
introduced for decentralized routing by allowing nodes to make decisions based
on local observations. However, Q-learning suffers from scalability issues and
poor generalization due to the difficulty in managing the Q-table in large or
dynamic network topologies, especially in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with
diverse channel characteristics. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel deep
Q-network (DQN)-based routing framework for heterogeneous multi-hop wireless
networks to maximize the end-to-end rate of the route by improving scalability
and adaptability, where each node uses a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate
the Q-values and jointly select the next-hop relay and a communication
technology for transmission. To achieve better performance with the DNN,
selecting which nodes to exchange information is critical, as it not only
defines the state and action spaces but also determines the input to the DNN.
To this end, we propose neighbor node selection strategies based on channel
gain and rate between nodes rather than a simple distance-based approach for an
improved set of states and actions for DQN-based routing. During training, the
model experiences diverse network topologies to ensure generalization and
robustness, and simulation results show that the proposed neighbor node
selection outperforms simple distance-based selection. Further, we observe that
the DQN-based approach outperforms various benchmark schemes and performs
comparably to the optimal approach.

### [9] [Research on UAV Applications in Public Administration: Based on an Improved RRT Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14096)
*Zhanxi Xie,Baili Lu,Yanzhao Gu,Zikun Li,Junhao Wei,Ngai Cheong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究了无人机在公共管理中的应用，提出改进的RRT算法(dRRT)，优化路径规划，仿真结果显示性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机从技术工具转变为治理基础设施，需解决能耗、避障和空域限制等问题。

Method: 提出dRRT算法，融合目标偏向、动态步长、绕行优先和B样条平滑策略。

Result: dRRT在仿真中表现优异，成功率100%，路径更短、更平滑。

Conclusion: dRRT适合紧急响应等场景，但需结合实时避障框架，推动城市治理和机器人技术进步。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
public management, focusing on optimizing path planning to address challenges
such as energy consumption, obstacle avoidance, and airspace constraints. As
UAVs transition from 'technical tools' to 'governance infrastructure', driven
by advancements in low-altitude economy policies and smart city demands,
efficient path planning becomes critical. The research proposes an enhanced
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (dRRT), incorporating four strategies:
Target Bias (to accelerate convergence), Dynamic Step Size (to balance
exploration and obstacle navigation), Detour Priority (to prioritize horizontal
detours over vertical ascents), and B-spline smoothing (to enhance path
smoothness). Simulations in a 500 m3 urban environment with randomized
buildings demonstrate dRRT's superiority over traditional RRT, A*, and Ant
Colony Optimization (ACO). Results show dRRT achieves a 100\% success rate with
an average runtime of 0.01468s, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and
smoother trajectories (maximum yaw angles <45{\deg}). Despite improvements,
limitations include increased computational overhead from added mechanisms and
potential local optima due to goal biasing. The study highlights dRRT's
potential for efficient UAV deployment in public management scenarios like
emergency response and traffic monitoring, while underscoring the need for
integration with real-time obstacle avoidance frameworks. This work contributes
to interdisciplinary advancements in urban governance, robotics, and
computational optimization.

### [10] [No More Marching: Learning Humanoid Locomotion for Short-Range SE(2) Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14098)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种强化学习方法，优化人形机器人在SE(2)目标下的运动表现，通过设计新的奖励函数提升了效率和自然性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人在实际工作中需频繁执行短距离运动，现有方法多针对速度跟踪而非直接到达目标位姿，导致效率低下。

Method: 开发了一种强化学习方法，设计了基于星座的奖励函数，以促进自然高效的面向目标的运动。

Result: 提出的方法在能量消耗、到达时间和步数上优于标准方法，并成功从模拟迁移到硬件。

Conclusion: 针对性的奖励设计对实用短距离人形运动至关重要。

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

Result: 在仿人机器人平台上，该方法能生成复杂的移动与操作行为，且物理一致性高。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决仿人机器人移动与操作问题的完整TAMP框架，实现了完全无环规划与全身动力学约束的结合。

Abstract: This work presents an optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP)
framework that unifies planning for locomotion and manipulation through a
shared representation of contact modes. We define symbolic actions as contact
mode changes, grounding high-level planning in low-level motion. This enables a
unified search that spans task, contact, and motion planning while
incorporating whole-body dynamics, as well as all constraints between the
robot, the manipulated object, and the environment. Results on a humanoid
platform show that our method can generate a broad range of physically
consistent loco-manipulation behaviors over long action sequences requiring
complex reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
enables the resolution of an integrated TAMP formulation with fully acyclic
planning and whole body dynamics with actuation constraints for the humanoid
loco-manipulation problem.

Result: 在五种不同形状的轨迹跟踪实验中验证了方法的有效性，并测试了其在噪声干扰和周期性条件下的鲁棒性。结果表明CCGAN-GP能有效促进跨领域技能迁移。

Conclusion: CCGAN-GP为软机器人控制器提供了更高的适应性和泛化能力，为跨领域知识迁移提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发适用于真实系统的MDP环境提供了指导，并展示了在有限资源和合理时间内解决复杂任务的可能性。

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation and path planning in continuous state and action
spaces with uncertain environments remains an open challenge. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving
this task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample
inefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL
for multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the
environment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable
environment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots
must visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths.
The task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe
the multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to
finding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the
environment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient
based RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world
applicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with
uncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness
by running inference on the learned models. We believe our work will guide the
researchers on how to develop MDP-based environments that are applicable to
real-world systems and solve them using the existing state-of-the-art RL
methods with limited resources and within reasonable time periods.

Conclusion: SimGenHOI通过生成模型和强化学习的结合，显著提升了人机交互动作的真实性和物理可行性。

Abstract: Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as
diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible
contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance
on our project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/simgen_hoi.

the technique through real-world flight experiments on aerial hardware
platforms subject to realistic deployment and onboard computational
constraints. The technique's performance is assessed in comparison with the
established control frameworks of feedback linearization for the blimp, and
nonlinear model predictive control for both quadrotor and blimp. The
performance metrics under consideration are (i) root mean square error of
flight trajectories with respect to target trajectories, (ii) algorithms'
computation times, and (iii) CPU energy consumption associated with the control
algorithms. The experimental findings show that the Newton-Raphson flow-based
tracking controller achieves comparable or superior tracking performance to the
baseline methods with substantially reduced computation time and energy
expenditure.

*Omar Mostafa,Nikolaos Evangeliou,Anthony Tzes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于平面障碍物空间的2D探索策略，利用双轮差速驱动系统进行探索，优先考虑避障安全性和未探测空间的探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统圆形足迹机器人无法即时调整姿态的问题，设计一种在障碍物密集环境中的安全探索策略。

Method: 使用双轮差速驱动系统，配备多种传感器（IMU、3D-LiDAR、RGB-D相机），采用RTAB-SLAM和骨骼化安全路径规划方法。

Result: 实验表明，该策略能够有效规划路径，确保避障安全并探索未探测空间。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂障碍环境下的机器人探索提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper suggests a 2D exploration strategy for a planar space cluttered
with obstacles. Rather than using point robots capable of adjusting their
position and altitude instantly, this research is tailored to classical agents
with circular footprints that cannot control instantly their pose. Inhere, a
self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system is used to explore the
place. The system is equipped with linear accelerometers and angular
gyroscopes, a 3D-LiDAR, and a forward-facing RGB-D camera. The system performs
RTAB-SLAM using the IMU and the LiDAR, while the camera is used for loop
closures. The mobile agent explores the planar space using a safe skeleton
approach that places the agent as far as possible from the static obstacles.
During the exploration strategy, the heading is towards any offered openings of
the space. This space exploration strategy has as its highest priority the
agent's safety in avoiding the obstacles followed by the exploration of
undetected space. Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent are
presented indicating the path planning strategy while exploring the space.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用生物（如蜥蜴）的空中调整反射来改进太空机械臂的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决微重力环境下空间机械臂系统（SMS）控制的挑战，尤其是机械臂与航天器基座之间的动态耦合问题。

Method: 通过计算机视觉技术提取蜥蜴的空中调整运动轨迹，并在多目标优化框架中分析这些轨迹的关键行为目标及其重要性。随后将这些轨迹作为SMS控制的参考轨迹。

Result: 研究结果显示，生物行为可以为空间机器人提供可解释且自适应的控制策略，有望提升未来任务的机动性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 生物灵感为太空机械臂控制提供了新的解决方案，为未来任务的优化奠定了基础。

Abstract: Robotic arms mounted on spacecraft, known as space manipulator systems
(SMSs), are critical for enabling on-orbit assembly, satellite servicing, and
debris removal. However, controlling these systems in microgravity remains a
significant challenge due to the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and
the spacecraft base. This study explores the potential of using biological
inspiration to address this issue, focusing on animals, particularly lizards,
that exhibit mid-air righting reflexes. Based on similarities between SMSs and
these animals in terms of behavior, morphology, and environment, their
air-righting motion trajectories are extracted from high-speed video recordings
using computer vision techniques. These trajectories are analyzed within a
multi-objective optimization framework to identify the key behavioral goals and
assess their relative importance. The resulting motion profiles are then
applied as reference trajectories for SMS control, with baseline controllers
used to track them. The findings provide a step toward translating evolved
animal behaviors into interpretable, adaptive control strategies for space
robotics, with implications for improving maneuverability and robustness in
future missions.

Motivation: 在复杂环境中，LiDAR特征退化对状态估计的可靠性构成挑战，需要一种鲁棒性更强的解决方案。

Method: 结合自适应异常值移除阈值和扫描到子图配准策略，利用IMU数据优化位姿估计，并设计新型加权矩阵融合预积分协方差和退化度量。

Result: 在稀疏或退化特征的室内外环境中，实验表明该方法在鲁棒性和准确性上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了LiDAR特征退化问题，显著提升了LiDAR-惯性里程计的性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) plays a vital role in achieving accurate
localization and mapping, especially in complex environments. However, the
presence of LiDAR feature degeneracy poses a major challenge to reliable state
estimation. To overcome this issue, we propose an enhanced LIO framework that
integrates adaptive outlier-tolerant correspondence with a scan-to-submap
registration strategy. The core contribution lies in an adaptive outlier
removal threshold, which dynamically adjusts based on point-to-sensor distance
and the motion amplitude of platform. This mechanism improves the robustness of
feature matching in varying conditions. Moreover, we introduce a flexible
scan-to-submap registration method that leverages IMU data to refine pose
estimation, particularly in degenerate geometric configurations. To further
enhance localization accuracy, we design a novel weighting matrix that fuses
IMU preintegration covariance with a degeneration metric derived from the
scan-to-submap process. Extensive experiments conducted in both indoor and
outdoor environments-characterized by sparse or degenerate features-demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms
of both robustness and accuracy.

Motivation: 在机器人控制和资源分配等应用中，动作约束下的策略学习对确保安全行为至关重要。研究ACIL问题是为了解决动作约束导致的专家与模仿者之间的占用度量不匹配问题。

Method: 论文提出DTWIL算法，通过轨迹对齐将专家演示转换为遵守动作约束的替代数据集。方法包括：1）将轨迹对齐转化为规划问题；2）使用模型预测控制（MPC）和DTW距离对齐轨迹。

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring
safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications.
In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained
Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fair-CoPlan是一种半分布式飞行规划器，通过协商优化无人航空系统（UAS）的飞行路径，确保公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有飞行规划器可能导致部分UAS飞行路径不公平的问题，作者提出了Fair-CoPlan，以公平分配飞行成本并促进城市空中交通（UAM）的广泛参与。

Method: Fair-CoPlan分为三步：1）PSU根据机场及周边容量约束起飞和着陆选择；2）运营商在约束下独立规划路径；3）PSU解决路径冲突并优化公平性。

Result: 仿真实验表明，Fair-CoPlan比非公平规划器更公平，仅以轻微延迟为代价。

Conclusion: Fair-CoPlan能提升UAM安全性、公平性和灵活性，促进更广泛的运营商参与。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging transportation paradigm in which
Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) autonomously transport passengers and goods in
cities. The UAS have different operators with different, sometimes competing
goals, yet must share the airspace. We propose a negotiated, semi-distributed
flight planner that optimizes UAS' flight lengths {\em in a fair manner}.
Current flight planners might result in some UAS being given disproportionately
shorter flight paths at the expense of others. We introduce Fair-CoPlan, a
planner in which operators and a Provider of Service to the UAM (PSU) together
compute \emph{fair} flight paths. Fair-CoPlan has three steps: First, the PSU
constrains take-off and landing choices for flights based on capacity at and
around vertiports. Then, operators plan independently under these constraints.
Finally, the PSU resolves any conflicting paths, optimizing for path length
fairness. By fairly spreading the cost of deconfliction Fair-CoPlan encourages
wider participation in UAM, ensures safety of the airspace and the areas below
it, and promotes greater operator flexibility. We demonstrate Fair-CoPlan
through simulation experiments and find fairer outcomes than a non-fair planner
with minor delays as a trade-off.

Result: FiReFly生成的轨迹更公平，提高了任务成功率；15个无人机可实现实时性能，50个无人机需权衡运行时间和公平性提升。

Conclusion: 公平性注入在多机器人运动规划中有效，FiReFly展示了可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: We propose injecting notions of fairness into multi-robot motion planning.
When robots have competing interests, it is important to optimize for some kind
of fairness in their usage of resources. In this work, we explore how the
robots' energy expenditures might be fairly distributed among them, while
maintaining mission success. We formulate a distributed fair motion planner and
integrate it with safe controllers in a algorithm called FiReFly. For simulated
reach-avoid missions, FiReFly produces fairer trajectories and improves mission
success rates over a non-fair planner. We find that real-time performance is
achievable up to 15 UAVs, and that scaling up to 50 UAVs is possible with
trade-offs between runtime and fairness improvements.

Motivation: 有限数据是离线模仿学习（IL）扩展的主要瓶颈，论文旨在通过预训练阶段从动态分解中学习表示，以缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出了一个基于噪声对比估计的损失函数，用于预训练阶段学习动态表示；这些表示可以从非专家数据中学习，减少下游IL的参数需求。

Result: 在MuJoCo实验中，仅需单条轨迹即可模仿专家策略；在真实四足机器人实验中，通过仿真数据预训练的表示成功学习了少量真实演示的行走策略。

Conclusion: 动态表示预训练能显著提升有限数据下的模仿学习性能，且可泛化到真实场景。

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to
walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

Motivation: 解决现有基于LLM的方法在动态适应性和可解释性上的缺陷，特别是在未知环境中语义特征触发新任务时的挑战。

Method: 结合四个模块：任务理解、在线子任务生成、最优子任务分配与调度、动态适应与人机交互验证，将LLM的开环世界推理能力与基于模型的优化方法结合。

Result: 实验证明了其卓越性能：100%成功率、平均完成160主任务和480子任务（基线3倍）、适应阶段LLM查询减少62%、复杂任务计划质量提升2倍。

Conclusion: DEXTER-LLM成功解决了动态任务规划中的适应性和可解释性问题，展现了在未知环境中的高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments
faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected
during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model
(LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on
one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic
adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the
processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM)
for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i)
a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks
specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an
online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and
explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an
optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via
search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop
verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both
subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected
online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning
capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods,
simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and
explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances,
with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks
completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during
adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

Motivation: 由于复杂的接触动态和部分可观测性，灵巧的手内操作一直是机器人领域的长期挑战。人类在此类任务中能够协同视觉和触觉，但现有机器人方法往往只优先考虑一种模态，限制了适应性。

Method: FBI框架通过动态感知潜在模型建立了触觉信号与物体运动之间的因果关系，利用基于Transformer的交互模块融合触觉和视觉特征，并训练一步扩散策略实现实时执行。

Result: 实验表明，FBI在两个自定义的手内操作任务和三个标准灵巧操作任务中，优于基线方法（仿真和现实世界均如此）。

Conclusion: FBI通过动态融合视觉和触觉信息，显著提升了机器人灵巧操作的性能，为多模态协同提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation is a long-standing challenge in robotics due
to complex contact dynamics and partial observability. While humans synergize
vision and touch for such tasks, robotic approaches often prioritize one
modality, therefore limiting adaptability. This paper introduces Flow Before
Imitation (FBI), a visuotactile imitation learning framework that dynamically
fuses tactile interactions with visual observations through motion dynamics.
Unlike prior static fusion methods, FBI establishes a causal link between
tactile signals and object motion via a dynamics-aware latent model. FBI
employs a transformer-based interaction module to fuse flow-derived tactile
features with visual inputs, training a one-step diffusion policy for real-time
execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms the baseline methods in both simulation and the real world on two
customized in-hand manipulation tasks and three standard dexterous manipulation
tasks. Code, models, and more results are available in the website

with the lid. Our solution combines VR-based teleoperation and Learning from
Demonstrations (LfD) to balance robustness and autonomy. Most subtasks were
executed through high-fidelity remote teleoperation, while the pizza placement
was handled by an ACT-based policy trained from 100 in-person teleoperated

scoring rules, task characteristics, and current technical capabilities, our
approach achieved both high efficiency and reliability, ultimately securing the
first place in the competition.

Abstract: Despite extensive developments in motion planning of autonomous aerial

deadlock in complex dynamic environments, leading to increased collision risks.
To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided

In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is
proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend
utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and
dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance
and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch
trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal
topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical
information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that
TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate
and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments.
Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Mobile robot platforms are increasingly being used to automate information
gathering tasks such as environmental monitoring. Efficient target tracking in
dynamic environments is critical for applications such as search and rescue and
pollutant cleanups. In this letter, we study active mapping of floating targets
that drift due to environmental disturbances such as wind and currents. This is
a challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal
variations in the map due to changing conditions. We propose an informative
path planning framework to map an arbitrary number of moving targets with
initially unknown positions in dynamic environments. A key component of our
approach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position
distributions over time. We propose an adaptive planning objective for target
tracking that leverages these predictions. Simulation experiments show that our
proposed planning objective improves target tracking performance compared to
existing methods that consider only entropy reduction as the planning
objective. Finally, we validate our approach in field tests using an autonomous
surface vehicle, showcasing its ability to track targets in real-world
monitoring scenarios.

Conclusion: M-ESEKF显著提升了滤波器的一致性和稳定性，适用于多样化的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Aiming to enhance the consistency and thus long-term accuracy of Extended
Kalman Filters for terrestrial vehicle localization, this paper introduces the
Manifold Error State Extended Kalman Filter (M-ESEKF). By representing the
robot's pose in a space with reduced dimensionality, the approach ensures
feasible estimates on generic smooth surfaces, without introducing artificial
constraints or simplifications that may degrade a filter's performance. The
accompanying measurement models are compatible with common loosely- and
tightly-coupled sensor modalities and also implicitly account for the ground
geometry. We extend the formulation by introducing a novel correction scheme
that embeds additional domain knowledge into the sensor data, giving more
accurate uncertainty approximations and further enhancing filter consistency.
The proposed estimator is seamlessly integrated into a validated modular state
estimation framework, demonstrating compatibility with existing
implementations. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations across diverse scenarios and
dynamic sensor configurations show that the M-ESEKF outperforms classical
filter formulations in terms of consistency and stability. Moreover, it
eliminates the need for scenario-specific parameter tuning, enabling its
application in a variety of real-world settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用肉类加工机器人的安全和透明度框架，解决人机协作中的安全和透明度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 劳动力短缺影响了肉类加工业，现有自动化技术昂贵且不够灵活，需开发能与人类协作的通用机器人。

Method: 通过手部检测系统和配备力传感器的刀具确保安全；使用LED和图形界面提升机器人的透明度。

Result: 框架通过用户研究验证，能够确保安全操作并提升工人对机器人行为的理解。

Conclusion: 该框架为肉类加工行业的人机协作提供了安全和透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated
technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and
enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly
specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers
to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to
develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform
multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry
experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these
collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to
ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand
what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a
safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.
For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors
nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human
comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an
instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact
between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce
a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an
LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we
design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the
human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure
safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's
actions which we validate through a user study.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 介绍了一款开源的JESD204B接收器IP核心ListenToJESD204B，支持高性能同步数据传输，相比商业IP更节省资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分信号链路在超声波系统中带宽和延迟不足，商用FPGA IP核心成本高且资源占用大，需要开源替代方案。

Method: 使用可综合的SystemVerilog实现，支持四通道12.8 Gb/s传输，采用模块化数据路径和弹性缓冲器等技术。

Result: 资源占用仅为107个逻辑块，比商业IP减少79%，验证了协议兼容性和30分钟无错误传输。

Conclusion: ListenToJESD204B是一款高效、经济且开源的选择，适用于高性能超声波系统。

Abstract: The demand for hundreds of tightly synchronized channels operating at tens of
MSPS in ultrasound systems exceeds conventional low-voltage differential
signaling links' bandwidth, pin count, and latency. Although the JESD204B
serial interface mitigates these limitations, commercial FPGA IP cores are
proprietary, costly, and resource-intensive. We present ListenToJESD204B, an
open-source receiver IP core released under a permissive Solderpad 0.51 license
for AMD Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ devices. Written in synthesizable
SystemVerilog, the core supports four GTH/GTY lanes at 12.8 Gb/s and provides
cycle-accurate AXI-Stream data alongside deterministic Subclass~1 latency. It
occupies only 107 configurable logic blocks (approximately 437 LUTs),
representing a 79\% reduction compared to comparable commercially available IP.
A modular data path featuring per-lane elastic buffers, SYSREF-locked LMFC
generation, and optional LFSR descrambling facilitates scaling to high lane
counts. We verified protocol compliance through simulation against the Xilinx
JESD204C IP in JESD204B mode and on hardware using TI AFE58JD48 ADCs. Block
stability was verified by streaming 80 MSPS, 16-bit samples over two 12.8 Gb/s
links for 30 minutes with no errors.

TL;DR: 论文分析了BEV的能效损失问题，提出了多电平逆变器（MLI）作为降低能耗和成本的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEV的驱动系统能量损失限制了实际续航里程并增加了成本，研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合1000多辆欧洲市场BEV的数据和逆变器-电机协同仿真，评估了三种逆变器拓扑结构在能效和成本上的潜力。

Result: 3L-TNPC逆变器可降低驱动循环损耗0.67 kWh/100 km，且只需30%额外的SiC芯片面积。

Conclusion: 部分负载优化的MLI是降低BEV能耗和系统成本的有效途径。

Abstract: Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have advanced significantly during the past
decade, yet drivetrain energy losses continue to restrict practical range and
elevate cost. A dataset comprising more than 1000 European-market BEVs (model
years 2010-2025) is combined with detailed inverter-motor co-simulation to
chart technology progress for and quantify the efficiency and cost-saving
potential of partial-load optimised multi-level inverter (MLI) for 2030.
Average drive-cycle range has climbed from 135 km to 455 km, while
fleet-average energy consumption has remained virtually constant. Three
inverter topologies are assessed to evaluate future efficiency and cost
enhancements: a conventional two-level (2L) six halfbridge (B6) inverter with
silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC) devices, and two three-level (3L) T-type
neutral point clamped (TNPC) and active neutral point clamped (ANPC) inverters
tailored for partial-load operation. The 3L-TNPC inverter, realised with only
30% additional SiC chip area, lowers drive-cycle drivetrain losses by 0.67
kWh/100 km relative to a SiC 2L-B6 baseline. These results identify
partial-load optimised MLIs as a cost-effective route to further reduce BEV
energy consumption and total system cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合感知验证模型和离线验证的方法，使用区间MDP提供灵活端到端的保障，适用于分布外测试条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代自主系统需要精确全面的情境感知，但深度神经网络的“黑盒”行为及对环境不确定性的敏感性使其难以形式化验证。现有验证技术依赖于过于严格的假设，限制了保障的适用性。

Method: 提出了一种统一感知验证模型与离线验证的方法，利用区间MDP提供端到端保障，能够直接适应分布外的测试条件。

Result: 在合成感知马尔可夫链和“山地车”基准测试中，方法能够提供紧密且严格的系统安全性边界。

Conclusion: 该方法为自主系统在不确定环境中的安全性验证提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise and comprehensive situational awareness is a critical capability of
modern autonomous systems. Deep neural networks that perceive task-critical
details from rich sensory signals have become ubiquitous; however, their
black-box behavior and sensitivity to environmental uncertainty and
distribution shifts make them challenging to verify formally. Abstraction-based
verification techniques for vision-based autonomy produce safety guarantees
contingent on rigid assumptions, such as bounded errors or known unique
distributions. Such overly restrictive and inflexible assumptions limit the
validity of the guarantees, especially in diverse and uncertain test-time
environments. We propose a methodology that unifies the verification models of
perception with their offline validation. Our methodology leverages interval
MDPs and provides a flexible end-to-end guarantee that adapts directly to the
out-of-distribution test-time conditions. We evaluate our methodology on a
synthetic perception Markov chain with well-defined state estimation
distributions and a mountain car benchmark. Our findings reveal that we can
guarantee tight yet rigorous bounds on overall system safety.

Conclusion: 高斯插值结合LSTM模型能有效处理电力负荷预测中的稀疏数据问题，为实际应用提供可行方案。

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

TL;DR: DualNILM是一个基于Transformer的多任务学习框架，用于解决非侵入式负载监测（NILM）中由于分布式能源注入导致传统方法性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式能源（如太阳能板和电池存储）的普及，传统NILM方法仅依赖电表数据的问题凸显，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出DualNILM框架，结合序列到点和序列到序列策略，基于Transformer捕捉多尺度时间依赖性，同时识别电器状态和注入能量。

Result: 实验证明DualNILM在双任务中表现优异，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: DualNILM为解决分布式能源环境下的NILM问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展和可重用控制策略需求的增加，研究形态学泛化能力成为重要课题。论文旨在理解信任区域方法在变维动作空间中的行为。

Method: 通过理论分析（TRPO和PPO）和实验验证（Gymnasium Swimmer环境），研究了动作空间维度变化对优化过程的影响。

Result: 提供了关于信任区域方法在形态学变化下的理论见解，并通过实验展示了其性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为形态学泛化提供了理论支持，并验证了信任区域方法的适用性。

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高密度电极阵列的需求带来了跨通道干扰和计算开销等问题，现有方法通常需要针对每个新任务重新优化，限制了其通用性。

Method: 提出基于通道活动系数（CAC）的任务无关方法ACCS，通过选择CAC排名前16的通道来提升分类准确性。

Result: ACCS方法在多类分类任务中实现了高达34.97%的准确性提升。

Conclusion: ACCS方法通过识别可重用的信息通道，适用于多样化的EEG应用，具有高度的适应性和通用性。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive,
low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher
spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the
development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of
channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and
computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often
employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically
task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work
proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based
Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity
Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By
selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97%
improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional
approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent
of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse
EEG-based applications.

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for
embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation
model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling
flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,
RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,
object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a
region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing
fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise
interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an
egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data.
Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for
evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will
advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents
and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks. The code, model

TL;DR: HRC-Pose is a novel depth-only框架，通过对比学习捕捉6D姿态的连续性，分离编码旋转和平移分量，在多任务多类别场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖6D姿态作为监督信号，忽略了姿态的连续性，导致预测不一致和泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用对比学习和分层排序方案，分离旋转和平移的编码，并设计姿态估计模块。

Result: 在REAL275和CAMERA25基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且实时运行。

Conclusion: HRC-Pose通过学习连续特征空间，展示了在真实世界应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

Motivation: 为了解决现有基于离散姿态码的可控运动生成（CoMo）方法在捕捉精细运动细节（如高频细节）上的局限性。

Method: 通过残差向量量化（RVQ）将连续运动特征与离散姿态码结合，保留姿态码的可解释性和可操控性的同时增强细节表现。

Result: 在HumanML3D数据集上，FID从0.041降至0.015，Top-1 R-Precision从0.508提升至0.510。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了运动生成的表达能力和可控性，为运动编辑提供了更精细的控制手段。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过融合单目RGB图像和AIS数据生成6D位姿估计数据集的新方法，解决了纯AIS数据的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AIS数据的可靠性、延迟等问题，单纯依赖AIS数据难以准确估计船舶的6D位姿，因此需要结合图像数据改进。

Method: 结合YOLOX-X网络检测的船舶图像与AIS数据，生成3D边界框表示6D位姿，并比较了Homography和PnP两种坐标对齐方法。

Result: PnP方法的投影误差显著低于Homography，YOLOX-X模型的mAP为0.80，并生成了公开数据集BONK-pose。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工标注即可生成6D位姿数据集，为船舶位姿估计提供了新的数据支持。

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal

communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this
future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

Motivation: 说话人嵌入在提升跟踪系统的身份分配性能方面具有潜力，但现有提取器在短时上下文和重叠语音中表现不佳，导致身份重分配效果受限。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏（KD）训练方法，从两个说话人混合中提取短上下文说话人嵌入，并利用波束成形减少重叠，同时研究了块状身份重分配的可行性。

Result: 蒸馏模型在短上下文嵌入提取中表现良好且对重叠更具鲁棒性，但块状重分配结果显示仍需改进以更好地处理同时语音。

Conclusion: 该方法在短上下文嵌入提取和减少重叠方面有效，但块状重分配需要进一步优化以提升性能。

Abstract: Speaker embeddings are promising identity-related features that can enhance
the identity assignment performance of a tracking system by leveraging its
spatial predictions, i.e, by performing identity reassignment. Common speaker
embedding extractors usually struggle with short temporal contexts and
overlapping speech, which imposes long-term identity reassignment to exploit
longer temporal contexts. However, this increases the probability of tracking
system errors, which in turn impacts negatively on identity reassignment. To
address this, we propose a Knowledge Distillation (KD) based training approach
for short context speaker embedding extraction from two speaker mixtures. We
leverage the spatial information of the speaker of interest using beamforming
to reduce overlap. We study the feasibility of performing identity reassignment
over blocks of fixed size, i.e., blockwise identity reassignment, to go towards
a low-latency speaker embedding based tracking system. Results demonstrate that
our distilled models are effective at short-context embedding extraction and
more robust to overlap. Although, blockwise reassignment results indicate that
further work is needed to handle simultaneous speech more effectively.
