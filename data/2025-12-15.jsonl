However, constructing high-fidelity RMs at operational scales is difficult, since physics-based solvers are time-consuming and require precise scene models, while learning methods degrade under incomplete priors and sparse measurements, often smoothing away critical discontinuities. We present RMSup, a physics-informed super-resolution framework that functions with uniform sparse sampling and imperfect environment priors. RMSup extracts Helmholtz equation-informed boundary and singularity prompts from the measurements, fuses them with base-station side information and coarse scene descriptors as conditional inputs, and employs a boundary-aware dual-head network to reconstruct a high-fidelity RM and recover environmental contours jointly. Experimental results show the proposed RMsup achieves state-of-the-art performance both in RM construction and ISAC-related environment sensing."}

An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the uplink covert transmission rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power and antenna positions while satisfying both communication reliability and covertness constraints. An alternative optimization (AO)-based framework is proposed to solve this problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed PA-BSC effectively mitigates the double near-far problem, where energy harvesting and backscatter transmission degrade simultaneously due to distance disparities, thereby improving downlink energy harvesting and uplink data transmission while maintaining covertness performance under practical deployment scenarios."}

Heavy noise further complicates the task by both obscuring and imitating the target appearance. Weak target signals require integrating target trajectories over multiple frames, an approach that can be computationally intensive. Dynamic programming offers an efficient solution by decomposing the problem into iterative maximization. This, however, has limited the analytical tools available for their study. In this paper, we present a robust framework for this class of algorithms and establish rigorous convergence results for error rates under mild assumptions. We depart from standard analysis by modeling error probabilities as a function of distance from the target, allowing us to construct a relationship between uncertainty in location and uncertainty in existence. From this framework, we introduce a novel algorithm, Normalized Path Integration (NPI), that utilizes the similarity between sequential observations, enabling target detection with unknown or time varying features."}

Additionally, the presence of both natural and anthropogenic acoustic sources, including shipping traffic, marine life, and geological activity, further complicates the underwater acoustic landscape. Addressing these challenges requires advanced underwater sensors and robust signal processing techniques. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages an optical fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system combined with a broadband generalized sparse covariance-fitting framework for underwater target direction sensing, particularly focusing on robustness against non-uniform noise. The DAS system incorporates a newly developed spiral-sensitized optical cable, which significantly improves sensitivity compared to conventional submarine cables. This innovative design enables the system to capture acoustic signals with greater precision. Notably, the sensitivity of the spiral-wound sensitized cable is around -145.69 dB re: 1 rad / (uPa*m), as measured inside the standing-wave tube. Employing simulations, we assess the performance of the algorithm across diverse noise levels and target configurations, consistently revealing higher accuracy and reduced background noise compared to conventional beamforming techniques and other sparse techniques. In a controlled pool experiment, the correlation coefficient between waveforms acquired by the DAS system and a standard hydrophone reached 0.973, indicating high fidelity in signal capture."}

Yet existing approaches, modular or end-to-end, are deficient in manipulation-aware locomotion. This confines the robot to a limited workspace, preventing it from performing large-space loco-manipulation. We attribute this to: (1) the challenge of acquiring loco-manipulation knowledge due to the scarcity of humanoid teleoperation data, and (2) the difficulty of faithfully and reliably executing locomotion commands, stemming from the limited precision and stability of existing RL controllers. To acquire richer loco-manipulation knowledge, we propose a unified latent learning framework that enables Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system to learn from low-cost action-free egocentric videos. Moreover, an efficient human data collection pipeline is devised to augment the dataset and scale the benefits. To more precisely execute the desired locomotion commands, we present a loco-manipulation-oriented (LMO) RL policy specifically tailored for accurate and stable core loco-manipulation movements, such as advancing, turning, and squatting. Building on these components, we introduce WholeBodyVLA, a unified framework for humanoid loco-manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, WholeBodyVLA is one of its kind enabling large-space humanoid loco-manipulation. It is verified via comprehensive experiments on the AgiBot X2 humanoid, outperforming prior baseline by 21.3%. It also demonstrates strong generalization and high extensibility across a broad range of tasks."}

In the backward sensing paradigm, the region of interest (RoI) is illuminated using a set of diverse radiation patterns. These patterns encode spatial information into a sequence of measurements, which are subsequently processed to reconstruct the RoI. We show that a single RIS can estimate the direction of arrival of incident waves by leveraging configurational diversity, and that the spatial diversity provided by multiple RISs further improves the accuracy of source localization and power estimation. The underlying structure of the sensing operator in the multi-snapshot measurement process is clarified. For single-RIS localization, the sensing operator is decomposed into a product of structured matrices, each corresponding to a specific physical process: wave propagation to and from the RIS, the relative phase offsets of elements with respect to the reference point, and the applied phase configuration of each element. A unified framework for identifying key performance indicators is established by analyzing the conditioning of the sensing operators. In the multi-RIS setting, we derive--via rank analysis--the governing law among the RoI size, the number of elements, and the number of measurements. Upper bounds on the relative error of the least squares reconstruction algorithm are derived. These bounds clarify how key performance indicators affect estimation error and provide valuable guidance for system-level optimization. Numerical experiments confirm that the trend of the relative error is consistent with the theoretical bounds."}

To perform such tasks, humans use a range of different body parts or tools with different rigidity, friction, etc., according to the properties most effective for a given task. Here, we discuss a taxonomy for the key properties of a non-actuated end-effector, laying the groundwork for a systematic understanding of the affordances of non-prehensile manipulators. We then present a modular tool system, based on the taxonomy, that can be used by a standard two-fingered gripper to extend its versatility and effectiveness in performing such actions.

The framework also provides a geometric interpretation of aliasing based on the antenna array geometry, target position, and antenna element spacing. Numerical results corroborate theoretical findings and show that the aliasing-free region enlarges with smaller antenna spacing, greater target range, lower array dimensionality, and smaller arrays.

Most of the RGB-based navigation systems only guarantee coarse, meter-level accuracy, making them less suitable for the precise positioning phase of mobile manipulation. This gap prevents manipulation policies from operating within the distribution of their training demonstrations, resulting in frequent execution failures. We address this gap by introducing an object-centric imitation learning framework for last-meter navigation, enabling a quadruped mobile manipulator robot to achieve manipulation-ready positioning using only RGB observations from its onboard cameras. Our method conditions the navigation policy on three inputs: goal images, multi-view RGB observations from the onboard cameras, and a text prompt specifying the target object. A language-driven segmentation module and a spatial score-matrix decoder then supply explicit object grounding and relative pose reasoning. Using real-world data from a single object instance within a category, the system generalizes to unseen object instances across diverse environments with challenging lighting and background conditions. To comprehensively evaluate this, we introduce two metrics: an edge-alignment metric, which uses ground truth orientation, and an object-alignment metric, which evaluates how well the robot visually faces the target. Under these metrics, our policy achieves 73.47% success in edge-alignment and 96.94% success in object-alignment when positioning relative to unseen target objects. These results show that precise last-meter navigation can be achieved at a category-level without depth, LiDAR, or map priors, enabling a scalable pathway toward unified mobile manipulation.

Due to the non-linear characteristics of mmWave radar signals, deep learning-based methods are well suited for extracting relevant information from in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data. However, the current state of the art in IQ signal-based occluded-object and material classification still offers substantial potential for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional cross-attention fusion network that combines IQ-signal and FFT-transformed radar features obtained by distinct complex-valued convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method achieves improved performance and robustness compared to standalone complex-valued CNNs. We achieve a near-perfect material classification accuracy of 99.92% on samples collected at same sensor-to-surface distances used during training, and an improved accuracy of 67.38% on samples measured at previously unseen distances, demonstrating improved generalization ability across varying measurement conditions.

While co-training with external reasoning data helps, it requires experienced tuning and data-related overhead. Beyond such external dependencies, we identify an intrinsic cause within VLA datasets: modality imbalance, where language diversity is much lower than visual and action diversity. This imbalance biases the model toward visual shortcuts and language forgetting. To address this, we introduce BayesVLA, a Bayesian factorization that decomposes the policy into a visual-action prior, supporting seeing-to-act, and a language-conditioned likelihood, enabling prompt-to-specify. This inherently preserves generalization and promotes instruction following. We further incorporate pre- and post-contact phases to better leverage pre-trained foundation models.

Recent work with MIMO mmWave radar has demonstrated its ability to penetrate cardboard packaging for occluded object classification. However, existing models leave room for improvement and warrant a more thorough evaluation across different sensing frequencies. In this paper, we propose ACCOR, an attention-enhanced complex-valued contrastive learning approach for radar, enabling robust occluded object classification. We process complex-valued IQ radar signals using a complex-valued CNN backbone, followed by a multi-head attention layer and a hybrid loss. Our proposed loss combines a weighted cross-entropy term with a supervised contrastive term. We further extend an existing 64 GHz dataset with a 67 GHz subset of the occluded objects and evaluate our model using both center frequencies. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms prior radar-specific models and image classification models with adapted input, achieving classification accuracies of 96.60% at 64 GHz and 93.59% at 67 GHz for ten different objects.

Scenario-based testing is a prominent approach to addressing this challenge, as it involves the systematic simulation of objects and environments. Operational Design Domains (ODDs) are usually described using a taxonomy of qualitative designations for individual objects. However, the process of transitioning from taxonomy to concrete test cases remains unstructured, and completeness is theoretical. This paper introduces a structured method of subdividing the ODD into manageable sections, termed micro-ODDs (mODDs), and deriving test cases with abstract object representations. This concept is demonstrated using a one-dimensional, laterally guided manoeuvre involving a shunting locomotive within a constrained ODD. In this example, mODDs are defined and refined into narrow taxonomies that enable test case generation. Obstacles are represented as generic cubes of varying sizes, providing a simplified yet robust means of evaluating perception performance. A series of tests were conducted in a closed-loop, co-simulated virtual environment featuring photorealistic rendering and simulated LiDAR, GNSS and camera sensors. The results demonstrate how edge cases in obstacle detection can be systematically explored and how perception quality can be evaluated based on observed vehicle behaviour, using crash versus safe stop as the outcome metrics. These findings support the development of a standardised framework for safety argumentation and offer a practical step towards the validation and authorisation of automated driving functions."}

Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) are particularly at risk, especially in urban environments where they are often occluded by parked vehicles or buildings. Autonomous Driving (AD) and Collective Perception (CP) are promising solutions to mitigate these risks. In particular, infrastructure-assisted CP, where sensor units are mounted on infrastructure elements such as traffic lights or lamp posts, can help overcome perceptual limitations by providing enhanced points of view, which significantly reduces occlusions. To encourage decision makers to adopt this technology, comprehensive studies and datasets demonstrating safety improvements for VRUs are essential. In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating the safety improvement by infrastructure-based CP specifically targeted at VRUs including a dataset with safety-critical EuroNCAP scenarios (CarlaNCAP) with 11k frames. Using this dataset, we conduct an in-depth simulation study and demonstrate that infrastructure-assisted CP can significantly reduce accident rates in safety-critical scenarios, achieving up to 100% accident avoidance compared to a vehicle equipped with sensors with only 33%.

Previous TAMP algorithms have focused mainly on computational performance, completeness, or optimality by making the problem tractable through simplifications and abstractions. However, this comes at the cost of the resulting plans potentially failing to account for the dynamics or complex contacts necessary to reliably perform the task when object manipulation is required. Additionally, approaches that ignore effects of the low-level controllers may not obtain optimal or feasible plan realizations for the real system. We investigate the use of a GPU-parallelized physics simulator to compute realizations of plans with motion controllers, explicitly accounting for dynamics, and considering contacts with the environment. Using cross-entropy optimization, we sample the parameters of the controllers, or actions, to obtain low-cost solutions. Since our approach uses the same controllers as the real system, the robot can directly execute the computed plans. We demonstrate our approach for a set of tasks where the robot is able to exploit the environment's geometry to move an object.

Although some studies have attempted to bridge this gap using reinforcement learning, they remain confined to merely reproducing human manipulation, resulting in limited task performance. In this paper, we propose UniBYD, a unified framework that uses a dynamic reinforcement learning algorithm to discover manipulation policies aligned with the robot's physical characteristics. To enable consistent modeling across diverse robotic hand morphologies, UniBYD incorporates a unified morphological representation (UMR). Building on UMR, we design a dynamic PPO with an annealed reward schedule, enabling reinforcement learning to transition from imitation of human demonstrations to explore policies adapted to diverse robotic morphologies better, thereby going beyond mere imitation of human hands. To address the frequent failures of learning human priors in the early training stage, we design a hybrid Markov-based shadow engine that enables reinforcement learning to imitate human manipulations in a fine-grained manner. To evaluate UniBYD comprehensively, we propose UniManip, the first benchmark encompassing robotic manipulation tasks spanning multiple hand morphologies. Experiments demonstrate a 67.90% improvement in success rate over the current state-of-the-art. Upon acceptance of the paper, we will release our code and benchmark at https://github.com/zhanheng-creator/UniBYD."}

Classic Artificial Intelligence techniques for this purpose, focusing on symbolic approaches, have long-ago hit the scalability wall on compute and memory costs. Advances in Large Language Models in the past decade (neural approaches) have resulted in unprecedented displays of capability, at the cost of control, explainability, and interpretability. Large Action Models aim at extending Large Language Models to encompass the full perception, reasoning, and action cycle; however, they typically require substantially more comprehensive training and suffer from the same deficiencies in reliability. Here, we show it is possible to build competent Large Action Models by composing off-the-shelf foundation models, and that their control, interpretability, and explainability can be effected by incorporating symbolic wrappers and associated verification on their outputs, achieving verifiable neuro-symbolic solutions for intelligent robots. Our experiments on a multi-modal robot demonstrate that Large Action Model intelligence does not require massive end-to-end training, but can be achieved by integrating efficient perception models with a logic-driven core. We find that driving action execution through the generation of Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) code enables a human-in-the-loop verification stage that effectively mitigates action hallucinations. These results can support practitioners in the design and development of robotic Large Action Models across novel industries, and shed light on the ongoing challenges that must be addressed to ensure safety in the field."}

In such settings, the mobile robot must go beyond traditional obstacle avoidance, leveraging pushing or nudging strategies to accomplish its goals. While research in pushing-based robotics is growing, evaluations rely on ad hoc setups, limiting reproducibility and cross-comparison. To address this, we present Bench-Push, the first unified benchmark for pushing-based mobile robot navigation and manipulation tasks. Bench-Push includes multiple components: 1) a comprehensive range of simulated environments that capture the fundamental challenges in pushing-based tasks, including navigating a maze with movable obstacles, autonomous ship navigation in ice-covered waters, box delivery, and area clearing, each with varying levels of complexity; 2) novel evaluation metrics to capture efficiency, interaction effort, and partial task completion; and 3) demonstrations using Bench-Push to evaluate example implementations of established baselines across environments. Bench-Push is open-sourced as a Python library with a modular design. The code, documentation, and trained models can be found at https://github.com/IvanIZ/BenchNPIN."}

In this study, we investigate whether and to what extent the human-like appearance of robots elicits anthropomorphism, which is conceptualised as an attribution of mental capacities, and how the level of anthropomorphism is revealed in explanations that people expect to receive. We designed a between-subject study comprising conditions with visual stimuli of three domestic service robots with varying human-like appearance, and we prompted respondents to provide explanations they would expect to receive from the robot for the same robot actions. We found that most explanations were anthropomorphic across all conditions. However, there is a positive correlation between the anthropomorphic explanations and human-like appearance. We also report on more nuanced trends observed in non-anthropomorphic explanations and trends in robot descriptions."}

We present BLURR, a lightweight inference wrapper that can be plugged into existing VLA controllers without retraining or changing model checkpoints. Instantiated on the pi-zero VLA controller, BLURR keeps the original observation interfaces and accelerates control by combining an instruction prefix key value cache, mixed precision execution, and a single step rollout schedule that reduces per step computation. In our SimplerEnv based evaluation, BLURR maintains task success rates comparable to the original controller while significantly lowering effective FLOPs and wall clock latency. We also build an interactive web demo that allows users to switch between controllers and toggle inference options in real time while watching manipulation episodes. This highlights BLURR as a practical approach for deploying modern VLA policies under tight compute budgets."}

To address this, we propose ProbeMDE, a cost-aware active sensing framework that combines RGB images with sparse proprioceptive measurements for MDE. Our approach utilizes an ensemble of MDE models to predict dense depth maps conditioned on both RGB images and on a sparse set of known depth measurements obtained via proprioception, where the robot has touched the environment in a known configuration. We quantify predictive uncertainty via the ensemble's variance and measure the gradient of the uncertainty with respect to candidate measurement locations. To prevent mode collapse while selecting maximally informative locations to propriocept (touch), we leverage Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) over this gradient map. We validate our method in both simulated and physical experiments on central airway obstruction surgical phantoms. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods across standard depth estimation metrics, achieving higher accuracy while minimizing the number of required proprioceptive measurements."}

We provide evidence in both simulation and the real world that this approach outperforms the common paradigm of training agents in isolation with rewards that prescribe behavior, e.g., progress on the raceline, in particular when the complexity of the environment increases, e.g., in the presence of obstacles. Moreover, we find that multi-agent competition yields policies that transfer more reliably to the real world than policies trained with a single-agent progress-based reward, despite the two methods using the same simulation environment, randomization strategy, and hardware. In addition to improved sim-to-real transfer, the multi-agent policies also exhibit some degree of generalization to opponents unseen at training time. Overall, our work, following in the tradition of multi-agent competitive game-play in digital domains, shows that sparse task-level rewards are sufficient for training agents capable of advanced low-level control in the physical world.\n  Code: https://github.com/Jirl-upenn/AgileFlight_MultiAgent"}

While generative models present an attractive solution, existing methods often alter only visual appearances without creating new behaviors, or suffer from embodiment inconsistencies that yield implausible motions. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorDream, an embodiment-aware world model that repurposes pretrained video diffusion models for robot data synthesis. AnchorDream conditions the diffusion process on robot motion renderings, anchoring the embodiment to prevent hallucination while synthesizing objects and environments consistent with the robot's kinematics. Starting from only a handful of human teleoperation demonstrations, our method scales them into large, diverse, high-quality datasets without requiring explicit environment modeling. Experiments show that the generated data leads to consistent improvements in downstream policy learning, with relative gains of 36.4% in simulator benchmarks and nearly double performance in real-world studies. These results suggest that grounding generative world models in robot motion provides a practical path toward scaling imitation learning."}

Infrared cameras provide complementary advantages in such environments. Simultaneously, supervised AI systems require large labeled datasets, which makes zero-shot learning frameworks more practical for applications including infrared cameras. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) offer a new path in zero-shot predictions from paired image-text representations. However, current VLMs cannot understand infrared camera data since they are trained on RGB data. This work introduces VLM-IRIS (Vision-Language Models for InfraRed Industrial Sensing), a zero-shot framework that adapts VLMs to infrared data by preprocessing infrared images captured by a FLIR Boson sensor into RGB-compatible inputs suitable for CLIP-based encoders. We demonstrate zero-shot workpiece presence detection on a 3D printer bed where temperature differences between the build plate and workpieces make the task well-suited for thermal imaging. VLM-IRIS converts the infrared images to magma representation and applies centroid prompt ensembling with a CLIP ViT-B/32 encoder to achieve high accuracy on infrared images without any model retraining. These findings demonstrate that the proposed improvements to VLMs can be effectively extended to thermal applications for label-free monitoring."}

Efficient stereo architectures, on the other hand, sacrifice robustness for speed and require costly per-domain fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-FoundationStereo, a family of architectures that achieve, for the first time, strong zero-shot generalization at real-time frame rate. We employ a divide-and-conquer acceleration strategy with three components: (1) knowledge distillation to compress the hybrid backbone into a single efficient student; (2) blockwise neural architecture search for automatically discovering optimal cost filtering designs under latency budgets, reducing search complexity exponentially; and (3) structured pruning for eliminating redundancy in the iterative refinement module. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline used to curate 1.4M in-the-wild stereo pairs to supplement synthetic training data and facilitate knowledge distillation. The resulting model can run over 10x faster than FoundationStereo while closely matching its zero-shot accuracy, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art among real-time methods.

While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations."}

By mapping in-situ visual representations of a human's body parts onto the corresponding robot's touch region, Mirror Skin communicates who shall initiate touch, where it will occur, and when it is imminent. To inform the design of Mirror Skin, we conducted a structured design exploration with experts in virtual reality (VR), iteratively refining six key dimensions. A subsequent controlled user study demonstrated that Mirror Skin significantly enhances accuracy and reduces response times for interpreting touch intent. These findings highlight the potential of visual feedback on robotic skin to communicate human-robot touch interactions."}

We reformulate a constrained minimum-time trajectory planning problem as a problem in a high-dimensional configuration space, where conflict zones are modeled by high-dimensional polyhedra constructed from two-dimensional rectangles. Still, in such a formulation, as the number of vehicles involved increases, the computational complexity increases significantly. To address this, we propose two algorithms for near-optimal local optimization that significantly reduce the computational complexity by decomposing the high-dimensional problem into a sequence of 2D graph search problems. The resulting trajectories are then incorporated into a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework to ensure safe and smooth vehicle motion.
