Abstract: Environmental sensing is an important research topic in the integrated

environments, such as buildings and terrains. However, dynamic factors like
rainfall can cause serious interference to wireless signals. In this paper, we
propose a system called RainfalLTE that utilizes the downlink signal of LTE
base stations for device-independent rain sensing. In articular, it is fully
compatible with current communication modes and does not require any additional
hardware. We evaluate it with LTE data and rainfall information provided by a
weather radar in Badaling Town, Beijing The results show that for 10 classes of
rainfall, RainfalLTE achieves over 97% identification accuracy. Our case study
shows that the assistance of rainfall information can bring more than 40%
energy saving, which provides new opportunities for the design and optimization
of ISAC systems.

### [3] [Generalizable Learning for Frequency-Domain Channel Extrapolation under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13867)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于物理学的深度学习信道外推方法，通过路径对齐和多路径结构缓解分布偏移，显著提升了在未见环境中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的信道外推方法在分布偏移的环境下表现不佳，限制了其大规模部署。论文旨在通过物理学方法解决这一问题。

Method: 采用基于物理的逐步分布对齐策略，包括路径导向设计和路径对齐，以分解多路径信道外推并缓解单路径响应的分布偏移。

Result: 在未见环境中，该方法比现有技术减少了超过6 dB的外推误差。

Conclusion: 通过物理学视角的分布对齐，实现了信道外推的环境泛化学习，为大规模部署提供了可行性。

Abstract: Frequency-domain channel extrapolation is effective in reducing pilot
overhead for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Recently,
Deep learning (DL) based channel extrapolator has become a promising candidate
for modeling complex frequency-domain dependency. Nevertheless, current DL
extrapolators fail to operate in unseen environments under distribution shift,
which poses challenges for large-scale deployment. In this paper, environment
generalizable learning for channel extrapolation is achieved by realizing
distribution alignment from a physics perspective. Firstly, the distribution
shift of wireless channels is rigorously analyzed, which comprises the
distribution shift of multipath structure and single-path response. Secondly, a
physics-based progressive distribution alignment strategy is proposed to
address the distribution shift, which includes successive path-oriented design
and path alignment. Path-oriented DL extrapolator decomposes multipath channel
extrapolation into parallel extrapolations of the extracted path, which can
mitigate the distribution shift of multipath structure. Path alignment is
proposed to address the distribution shift of single-path response in
path-oriented DL extrapolators, which eventually enables generalizable learning
for channel extrapolation. In the simulation, distinct wireless environments
are generated using the precise ray-tracing tool. Based on extensive
evaluations, the proposed path-oriented DL extrapolator with path alignment can
reduce extrapolation error by more than 6 dB in unseen environments compared to
the state-of-the-arts.

### [4] [Waveform for Next Generation Communication Systems: Comparing Zak-OTFS with OFDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13966)
*Imran Ali Khan,Saif Khan Mohammed,Ronny Hadani,Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam,Robert Calderbank,Anton Monk,Shachar Kons,Shlomo Rakib,Yoav Hebron*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 摘要比较了CP-OFDM和Zak-OTFS在6G环境中的性能，分析了两种波形在对抗ICI和ISI时的不同策略及其适用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Zak-OTFS和OFDM在不同6G传播环境中的性能差异，为未来无线通信架构选择提供依据。

Method: 通过全面的性能比较，分析CP-OFDM和Zak-OTFS在多种6G传播环境下的表现。

Result: Zak-OTFS在高延迟/多普勒扩展的6G用例中表现更优，但选择取决于典型用例和地理因素。

Conclusion: Zak-OTFS和OFDM的选择是架构性问题，需根据具体场景和未来需求决定。

Abstract: Across the world, there is growing interest in new waveforms, Zak-OTFS in
particular, and over-the-air implementations are starting to appear. The choice
between OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an
architectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and
embracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known,
equalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in
the presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is
non-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to
inter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and
its acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in
doubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high
mobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the
typical use case, today and in the future. What is typical depends to some
degree on geography, since large delay spread is a characteristic of large
cells which are the rule rather than the exception in many important wireless
markets.} This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison of cyclic
prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) and Zak-OTFS across the full range of 6G propagation
environments. The performance results provide insights into the fundamental
architectural choice.

### [5] [Near-Field RIS-Assisted Localization Under Mutual Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14055)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RIS规模增大，元素间互耦效应（MC）对ISAC系统的性能，尤其是定位精度，产生了显著负面影响。现有方法往往忽略MC，导致性能严重下降。

Method: 作者首先通过误设和标准Cramér-Rao界分析量化MC对定位性能的影响，然后提出了一种两阶段的MC感知方法（JLMC），联合估计用户设备位置和RIS MC参数。

Result: 模拟结果表明，JLMC方法显著优于忽略MC的传统方法，显著提升了定位精度和系统整体性能。

Conclusion: JLMC方法有效解决了RIS中MC引起的性能问题，为近场无线系统的实际应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have the potential to
significantly enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) systems, particularly in line-of-sight (LoS) blockage scenarios.
However, as larger RISs are integrated into ISAC systems, mutual coupling (MC)
effects between RIS elements become more pronounced, leading to a substantial
degradation in performance, especially for localization applications. In this
paper, we first conduct a misspecified and standard Cram\'er-Rao bound analysis
to quantify the impact of MC on localization performance, demonstrating severe
degradations in accuracy, especially when MC is ignored. Building on this, we
propose a novel joint user equipment localization and RIS MC parameter
estimation (JLMC) method in near-field wireless systems. Our two-stage MC-aware
approach outperforms classical methods that neglect MC, significantly improving
localization accuracy and overall system performance. Simulation results
validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in realistic
scenarios.

Conclusion: 子块策略和CAEformer算法有效解决了混合场通信中的信道估计问题，简化了模型并提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation (CE) for uplink hybrid-field communications
involving multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices assisted by an active
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is investigated. Firstly, to reduce the
complexity of near-field (NF) channel modeling and estimation between IoT
devices and active IRS, a sub-blocking strategy for active IRS is proposed.
Specifically, the entire active IRS is divided into multiple smaller
sub-blocks, so that IoT devices are located in the far-field (FF) region of
each sub block, while also being located in the NF region of the entire active
IRS. This strategy significantly simplifies the channel model and reduces the
parameter estimation dimension by decoupling the high-dimensional NF channel
parameter space into low dimensional FF sub channels. Subsequently, the
relationship between channel approximation error and CE error with respect to
the number of sub blocks is derived, and the optimal number of sub blocks is
solved based on the criterion of minimizing the total error. In addition,
considering that the amplification capability of active IRS requires power
consumption, a closed-form expression for the optimal power allocation factor
is derived. To further reduce the pilot overhead, a lightweight CE algorithm
based on convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and multi-head attention mechanism,
called CAEformer, is designed. The Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived to
evaluate the proposed algorithm's performance. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate the proposed CAEformer network significantly outperforms the
conventional least square and minimum mean square error scheme in terms of
estimation accuracy.

### [7] [EM-Based Channel Estimation for mMIMO LEO SATCOM Under Imperfect Doppler Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14118)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于期望最大化（EM）算法和离散勒让德多项式基展开方法（DLP-BEM）的数据辅助信道估计器，用于解决低地球轨道通信中由用户移动性引起的信道老化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地球轨道（LEO）通信中的信道高度时变，传统信道估计方法在缺乏用户精准位置信息时表现不佳。

Method: 结合EM算法和DLP-BEM，通过迭代利用隐藏数据符号和降维投影来改善信道估计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法在归一化均方误差和符号错误率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了信道老化问题，提升了信道估计性能。

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output low-Earth-orbit communication channels
are highly time-varying due to severe Doppler shifts and propagation delays.
While satellite-mobility-induced Doppler shifts can be compensated using known
ephemeris data, those caused by user mobility require accurate user positioning
information; the absence of such information contributes to amplified channel
aging in conventional channel estimators. To address this challenge, we propose
a data-aided channel estimator based on the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm, combined with a discrete Legendre polynomial basis expansion method
(DLP-BEM), to estimate the channel under imperfect Doppler compensation. The EM
algorithm iteratively exploits hidden data symbols for improved channel
estimation, while DLP-BEM regularizes the process by projecting the channel
estimate onto a lower dimensional subspace that mitigates estimation errors.
Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over
existing methods in terms of normalized mean square error and symbol error
rate.

### [8] [Elliptic Curve Modulation (ECM) for Extremely Robust Physical Layer Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14153)
*Thrassos K. Oikonomou,George K. Karagiannidis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型调制方案ECM，通过椭圆曲线点实现数据混淆，保持与未加密系统相同的误码性能，并提出改进版ECM-DR，增强安全性且不增加计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升物理层加密的安全性和效率，同时保持与传统调制方案相同的误码性能。

Method: 利用椭圆曲线点实现数据混淆，结合动态旋转和预计算优化。

Result: ECM-DR实现了接近最大信息熵的安全性，同时保持与未加密QAM相同的误码性能。

Conclusion: ECM-DR是一种高效的物理层加密方案，适用于安全的无线通信。

Abstract: This paper introduces Elliptic Curve Modulation (ECM), a novel modulation
scheme that can be leveraged to effectively shuffle transmitted data while
maintaining symbol error probability (SEP) performance equivalent to
unencrypted systems. By utilizing the well-distributed elliptic curve points
over the field of large primes, ECM enhances symbol obfuscation, making it a
powerful foundation for physical-layer encryption (PLE). Each symbol is mapped
from a predefined key while preserving a minimum Euclidean distance constraint,
ensuring strong security against adversarial inference without compromising
error performance. Building on ECM's strong obfuscation capabilities, we
propose ECM with dynamic rotation (ECM-DR) as a practical PLE scheme that
achieves near-maximal obfuscation while balancing precomputation complexity. By
leveraging a reduced subset of precomputed elliptic curve points and key-based
dynamic constellation rotation, ECM-DR ensures that each transmission remains
unpredictable, significantly enhancing security compared to traditional PLE
schemes without additional computational cost. Security analysis confirms ECM's
resilience to brute-force attacks, while numerical results demonstrate its
strong obfuscation capabilities. Furthermore, ECM-DR achieves near-maximum
information entropy while preserving the SEP performance of unencrypted
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), offering an extremely robust solution
for secure wireless communications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决用户移动和接收器随机方向导致性能下降的问题，采用可调谐液体透镜以提高信号接收和系统性能。

Method: 开发了精确的数学模型分析信道增益，并提出了两种透镜优化策略：最佳信号接收（BSR）和垂直向上透镜方向（VULO）。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方案在多种条件下将中断概率从$1\times10^{-1}$降至$3\times10^{-3}$。

Conclusion: 可调谐液体透镜及其优化策略有效提升了移动可见光通信系统的性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a tunable liquid lens (TLL)-assisted indoor mobile
visible light communication system. To mitigate performance degradation caused
by user mobility and random receiver orientation, an electrowetting cuboid TLL
is used at the receiver. By dynamically controlling the orientation angle of
the liquid surface through voltage adjustments, signal reception and overall
system performance are enhanced. An accurate mathematical framework is
developed to model channel gains, and two lens optimization strategies, namely
($i$) the best signal reception (BSR), and ($ii$) the vertically upward lens
orientation (VULO) are introduced for improved performance. Closed form
expressions for the outage probability are derived for each scheme for
practical mobility and receiver orientation conditions. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed TLL and lens adjustment strategies significantly
reduce the outage probability compared to fixed lens and no lens receivers
across various mobility and orientation conditions. Specifically, the outage
probability is improved from $1\times 10^{-1}$ to $3\times 10^{-3}$ at a
transmit power of $12$ dBW under a $8^{\circ}$ polar angle variation in random
receiver orientation using the BSR scheme.

Result: 在实验中成功捕捉低至30mV的电压降，且在不同电流负载下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效、鲁棒地检测瞬态微短路故障，提升电池安全性。

Abstract: A specific failure mode designated as transient micro-short circuit (TMSC)
has been identified in practical battery systems, exhibiting subtle and latent
characteristics with measurable voltage deviations. To further improve the safe
use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), this letter introduces a novel method for
the precise detection of this TMSC faults within LIBs. The method applies the
continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to voltage and current signals, followed by
the identification of micro-scale anomalies through the analysis of the
coherence in the wavelet spectrum at specific frequency. Through designed fault
experiments, the effec-tiveness of this method has been verified. Result
demon-strates that it can effectively capture micro-faults with a voltage drop
as low as 30 mV within just a few seconds. Furthermore, the proposed method is
inherently highly robust and is able to effectively detect false faults and
hidden faults under varying current loads, which highlights the superiority of
this method.

*Simon Geirnaert,Simon L. Kappel,Preben Kidmose*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了从不同类型EEG系统中解码听觉注意力的性能差异，强调了实用性与性能之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有助听设备无法适应使用者的听觉注意力焦点，限制了复杂环境中的效果。研究旨在探索更实用的EEG系统（如耳周和耳内EEG）用于听觉注意力解码（AAD）。

Method: 使用头皮、耳周和耳内EEG系统同时记录数据，并通过线性刺激重建算法比较它们的AAD性能。

Result: 头皮EEG性能最佳（83.4%），耳周EEG次之（67.2%），耳内EEG最低（61.1%）。加入外部参考或少量头皮电极可显著提升耳内EEG性能（>10%）。

Conclusion: 耳内EEG虽有性能差距，但结合传感器网络或改进算法后具有潜力，是AAD领域的有前景选择。

Abstract: Current assistive hearing devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear
implants, lack the ability to adapt to the listener's focus of auditory
attention, limiting their effectiveness in complex acoustic environments like
cocktail party scenarios where multiple conversations occur simultaneously.
Neuro-steered hearing devices aim to overcome this limitation by decoding the
listener's auditory attention from neural signals, such as
electroencephalography (EEG). While many auditory attention decoding (AAD)
studies have used high-density scalp EEG, such systems are impractical for
daily use as they are bulky and uncomfortable. Therefore, AAD with wearable and
unobtrusive EEG systems that are comfortable to wear and can be used for
long-term recording are required. Around-ear EEG systems like cEEGrids have
shown promise in AAD, but in-ear EEG, recorded via custom earpieces offering
superior comfort, remains underexplored. We present a new AAD dataset with
simultaneously recorded scalp, around-ear, and in-ear EEG, enabling a direct
comparison. Using a classic linear stimulus reconstruction algorithm, a
significant performance gap between all three systems exists, with AAD
accuracies of 83.4% (scalp), 67.2% (around-ear), and 61.1% (in-ear) on 60s
decision windows. These results highlight the trade-off between decoding
performance and practical usability. Yet, while the ear-based systems using
basic algorithms might currently not yield accurate enough performances for a
decision speed-sensitive application in hearing aids, their significant
performance suggests potential for attention monitoring on longer timescales.
Furthermore, adding an external reference or a few scalp electrodes via greedy
forward selection substantially and quickly boosts accuracy by over 10 percent
point, especially for in-ear EEG. These findings position in-ear EEG as a
promising component in EEG sensor networks for AAD.

### [12] [Performance Optimization of Energy-Harvesting Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks Using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14581)
*Deemah H. Tashman,Soumaya Cherkaoui,Walaa Hamouda*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的认知无线电网络性能优化方法，通过能量收集和深度Q网络策略，提高了次级用户的数据传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在认知无线电网络中，次级用户需要在主用户干扰下进行能量收集和通信，优化其数据传输性能是一个重要问题。

Method: 采用深度Q网络（DQN）策略，次级用户根据预设阈值选择能量来源（主用户干扰或环境射频源），并通过时间切换方法实现能量收集。同时，动态选择能量收集或数据传输以及合适的发射功率。

Result: 提出的方法在平均数据速率上优于基准策略，并且能够收敛。

Conclusion: 通过智能能量收集和功率选择，本文方法有效提升了认知无线电网络的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a reinforcement learning technique is employed to maximize the
performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN). In the presence of primary
users (PUs), it is presumed that two secondary users (SUs) access the licensed
band within underlay mode. In addition, the SU transmitter is assumed to be an
energy-constrained device that requires harvesting energy in order to transmit
signals to their intended destination. Therefore, we propose that there are two
main sources of energy; the interference of PUs' transmissions and ambient
radio frequency (RF) sources. The SU will select whether to gather energy from
PUs or only from ambient sources based on a predetermined threshold. The
process of energy harvesting from the PUs' messages is accomplished via the
time switching approach. In addition, based on a deep Q-network (DQN) approach,
the SU transmitter determines whether to collect energy or transmit messages
during each time slot as well as selects the suitable transmission power in
order to maximize its average data rate. Our approach outperforms a baseline
strategy and converges, as shown by our findings.

Conclusion: HDE-Array和RPC-Net有望革新医疗和非医疗应用的控制方式。

Abstract: This paper aims to introduce HDE-Array (High-Density Electrode Array), a
novel dry electrode array for acquiring High-Density surface electromyography
(HD-sEMG) for hand position estimation through RPC-Net (Recursive Prosthetic
Control Network), a neural network defined in a previous study. We aim to
demonstrate the hypothesis that the position estimates returned by RPC-Net
using HD-sEMG signals acquired with HDE-Array are as accurate as those obtained
from signals acquired with gel electrodes. We compared the results, in terms of
precision of hand position estimation by RPC-Net, using signals acquired by
traditional gel electrodes and by HDE-Array. As additional validation, we
performed a variance analysis to confirm that the presence of only two rows of
electrodes does not result in an excessive loss of information, and we
characterized the electrode-skin impedance to assess the effects of the voltage
divider effect and power line interference. Performance tests indicated that
RPC-Net, used with HDE-Array, achieved comparable or superior results to those
observed when used with the gel electrode setup. The dry electrodes
demonstrated effective performance even with a simplified setup, highlighting
potential cost and usability benefits. These results suggest improvements in
the accessibility and user-friendliness of upper-limb rehabilitation devices
and underscore the potential of HDE-Array and RPC-Net to revolutionize control
for medical and non-medical applications.

Abstract: Clustering of time series based on their underlying dynamics is keeping
attracting researchers due to its impacts on assisting complex system
modelling. Most current time series clustering methods handle only scalar time
series, treat them as white noise, or rely on domain knowledge for high-quality
feature construction, where the autocorrelation pattern/feature is mostly
ignored. Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the
system identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by
explicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first
derive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model.
Unfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems. We then
derive a `small-noise' limiting version of the algorithm, which we call k-LMVAR
(Limiting Mixture Vector AutoRegression), that is computationally manageable.
We develop an associated BIC criterion for choosing the number of clusters and
model order. The algorithm performs very well in comparative simulations and
also scales well computationally.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated unprecedented performance
across various domains, and its application to communication systems is an
active area of research. While current methods focus on task-specific
solutions, the broader trend in AI is shifting toward large general models
capable of supporting multiple applications. In this work, we take a step
toward a foundation model for communication data--a transformer-based,
multi-modal model designed to operate directly on communication data. We
propose methodologies to address key challenges, including tokenization,
positional embedding, multimodality, variable feature sizes, and normalization.
Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that such a model can successfully
estimate multiple features, including transmission rank, selected precoder,
Doppler spread, and delay profile.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中个性化学习和鲁棒性的双重挑战。

Method: 结合分布式梯度下降和Friedkin-Johnsen意见动力学模型。

Result: 算法在收敛速度和模型范围上表现良好，实验显示在个性化和恶意代理环境下均优于标准方法。

Conclusion: 该算法通过参数调节实现了个性化和鲁棒性的平衡，适用于实际分布式学习任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in
multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience.
Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models
tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the
other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous
training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between
these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that
combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion
dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the
neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily
controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more
personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of
our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it
achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious
agents compared to standard strategies.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于体积-表面积分方程（VSIE）的全局麦克斯韦断层扫描（GMT）方法，优于传统的体积积分方程（VIE）方法，能更准确地估计电学特性（EP）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的GMT方法使用体积积分方程（VIE），假设样品对线圈电流的影响可忽略，导致重建结果误差较大。为了改进这一问题，作者提出了基于VSIE的新方法。

Method: 通过模拟8通道收发线圈阵列（用于7T脑成像），并使用VSIE-GMT重构头部模型的EP。实验中，构建了线圈并测量了双室体模的MR数据。

Result: 仿真中，VSIE-GMT比VIE-GMT性能提升至少12%。实验中，内（外）室EP的相对误差分别为13%（26%）和17%（33）。

Conclusion: VSIE-GMT通过考虑EP对线圈电流的影响，显著提升了性能，且无需初始EP估计，更适合实验重建。

Abstract: Objective: Global Maxwell Tomography (GMT) is a noninvasive inverse
optimization method for the estimation of electrical properties (EP) from
magnetic resonance (MR) measurements. GMT uses the volume integral equation
(VIE) in the forward problem and assumes that the sample has negligible effect
on the coil currents. Consequently, GMT calculates the coil's incident fields
with an initial EP distribution and keeps them constant for all optimization
iterations. This can lead to erroneous reconstructions. This work introduces a
novel version of GMT that replaces VIE with the volume-surface integral
equation (VSIE), which recalculates the coil currents at every iteration based
on updated EP estimates before computing the associated fields. Methods: We
simulated an 8-channel transceiver coil array for 7 T brain imaging and
reconstructed the EP of a realistic head model using VSIE-based GMT. We built
the coil, collected experimental MR measurements, and reconstructed EP of a
two-compartment phantom. Results: In simulations, VSIE-based GMT outperformed
VIE-based GMT by at least 12% for both EP. In experiments, the relative
difference with respect to probe-measured EP values in the inner (outer)
compartment was 13% (26%) and 17% (33%) for the permittivity and conductivity,
respectively. Conclusion: The use of VSIE over VIE enhances GMT's performance
by accounting for the effect of the EP on the coil currents. Significance:
VSIE-based GMT does not rely on an initial EP estimate, rendering it more
suitable for experimental reconstructions compared to the VIE-based GMT.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分区的图滤波框架CPF，结合了图级和节点级滤波的优势，解决了异质图处理问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图级滤波在异质图上表现不佳，而节点级滤波可能过度参数化。论文旨在统一两种滤波策略，并提供理论支持。

Method: 提出CPF方法，通过图粗化和特征聚类生成节点分区，分阶段进行结构感知和特征感知的分区滤波。

Result: CPF在节点分类和异常检测任务中优于其他滤波范式，验证了其理论优势。

Conclusion: CPF为图滤波提供了一种高效且灵活的框架，适用于多种图数据场景。

Abstract: Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of
GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving
notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a
graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet
recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic
graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering,
which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced
adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework
unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights
into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual
Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise
filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs
exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive
parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address
the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise
Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The
method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node
partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs
feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering
on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis
is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other
paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a
real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and
practical utility.

TL;DR: U-SAM是一个先进的音频语言模型，结合了专门编码器和预训练大语言模型，通过MoE投影器和对比损失模块提升了跨模态对齐能力，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频任务模型在多样化音频理解上存在挑战，且仅依赖交叉熵损失导致跨模态对齐效果不佳。

Method: U-SAM整合了语音、音频和音乐的专门编码器与LLM，使用MoE投影器动态融合特征，并引入对比损失模块优化冗余特征。

Result: U-SAM在多项基准测试中表现优于专业模型和其他音频语言模型，并展示了在未见任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: U-SAM通过任务感知特征融合和语义对比损失，显著提升了音频理解的全面性和跨模态对齐效果。

Abstract: The text generation paradigm for audio tasks has opened new possibilities for
unified audio understanding. However, existing models face significant
challenges in achieving a comprehensive understanding across diverse audio
types, such as speech, general audio events, and music. Furthermore, their
exclusive reliance on cross-entropy loss for alignment often falls short, as it
treats all tokens equally and fails to account for redundant audio features,
leading to weaker cross-modal alignment. To deal with the above challenges,
this paper introduces U-SAM, an advanced audio language model that integrates
specialized encoders for speech, audio, and music with a pre-trained large
language model (LLM). U-SAM employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) projector for
task-aware feature fusion, dynamically routing and integrating the
domain-specific encoder outputs. Additionally, U-SAM incorporates a
Semantic-Aware Contrastive Loss Module, which explicitly identifies redundant
audio features under language supervision and rectifies their semantic and
spectral representations to enhance cross-modal alignment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that U-SAM consistently outperforms both specialized
models and existing audio language models across multiple benchmarks. Moreover,
it exhibits emergent capabilities on unseen tasks, showcasing its
generalization potential. Code is available

Motivation: 解决现有仿真工具在V2X通信技术共存分析中缺乏高精度物理层建模的问题。

Method: 扩展ms-van3t仿真器，集成Sionna射线追踪器，开发干扰跟踪模块以捕获跨技术干扰。

Result: 相比现有工具，VaN3Twin在应用层误差上减少了50%（乡村）和70%（城市）。

Conclusion: VaN3Twin为V2X技术的共存提供了可扩展且精确的数字孪生仿真解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents VaN3Twin-the first open-source, full-stack Network
Digital Twin (NDT) framework for simulating the coexistence of multiple
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies with accurate
physical-layer modeling via ray tracing. VaN3Twin extends the ms-van3t
simulator by integrating Sionna Ray Tracer (RT) in the loop, enabling
high-fidelity representation of wireless propagation, including diverse
Line-of-Sight (LoS) conditions with focus on LoS blockage due to other
vehicles' meshes, Doppler effect, and site-dependent effects-e.g., scattering
and diffraction. Unlike conventional simulation tools, the proposed framework
supports realistic coexistence analysis across DSRC and C-V2X technologies
operating over shared spectrum. A dedicated interference tracking module
captures cross-technology interference at the time-frequency resource block
level and enhances signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) estimation by
eliminating artifacts such as the bimodal behavior induced by separate LoS/NLoS
propagation models. Compared to field measurements, VaN3Twin reduces
application-layer disagreement by 50% in rural and over 70% in urban
environments with respect to current state-of-the-art simulation tools,
demonstrating its value for scalable and accurate digital twin-based V2X
coexistence simulation.

Conclusion: FIRES为一种新的范式，整合了多种技术优势，展现出比传统方法更优的性能。

Abstract: This letter introduces the concept of fluid integrated reflecting and
emitting surface (FIRES), which constitutes a new paradigm seamlessly
integrating the flexibility of fluid-antenna systems (FASs) with the dual
functionality of simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). The potential of the proposed metasurface
structure is studied though an FIRES-enabled multicast system based on the
energy splitting protocol. In this model, the FIRES is divided into
non-overlapping subareas, each functioning as a 'fluid' element capable of
concurrent reflection and transmission and changing its position of radiation
within the subarea. In particular, we formulate an optimization problem for the
design of the triple tunable features of the surface unit elements, which is
solved via a tailored particle swarm optimization approach. Our results
showcase that the proposed FIRES architecture significantly outperforms its
conventional STAR-RIS counterpart.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂性和性能之间取得了良好权衡，为RIS辅助通信提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the performance of a multiple reconfigurable intelligence
surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) beamspace multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple users (UEs). We focus on a
challenging scenario in which the direct links between the base station (BS)
and all UEs are blocked, and communication is facilitated only via RISs. The
maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is utilized for data precoding, while a
low-complexity algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is designed
to jointly perform beam selection, power allocation, and RIS profile
configuration. The proposed optimization approach demonstrates positive
trade-offs between the complexity (in terms of running time) and the achievable
sum rate. In addition, our results demonstrate that due to the sparsity of
beamspace channels, increasing the number of unit cells (UCs) at RISs can lead
to higher achievable rates than activating a larger number of beams at the MIMO
BS.
