Nevertheless, current DL\nextrapolators fail to operate in unseen environments under distribution shift,\nwhich poses challenges for large-scale deployment. In this paper, environment\ngeneralizable learning for channel extrapolation is achieved by realizing\ndistribution alignment from a physics perspective. Firstly, the distribution\nshift of wireless channels is rigorously analyzed, which comprises the\ndistribution shift of multipath structure and single-path response. Secondly, a\nphysics-based progressive distribution alignment strategy is proposed to\naddress the distribution shift, which includes successive path-oriented design\nand path alignment. Path-oriented DL extrapolator decomposes multipath channel\nextrapolation into parallel extrapolations of the extracted path, which can\nmitigate the distribution shift of multipath structure. Path alignment is\nproposed to address the distribution shift of single-path response in\npath-oriented DL extrapolators, which eventually enables generalizable learning\nfor channel extrapolation. In the simulation, distinct wireless environments\nare generated using the precise ray-tracing tool.

Firstly, to reduce the\ncomplexity of near-field (NF) channel modeling and estimation between IoT\ndevices and active IRS, a sub-blocking strategy for active IRS is proposed.\nSpecifically, the entire active IRS is divided into multiple smaller\nsub-blocks, so that IoT devices are located in the far-field (FF) region of\neach sub block, while also being located in the NF region of the entire active\nIRS. This strategy significantly simplifies the channel model and reduces the\nparameter estimation dimension by decoupling the high-dimensional NF channel\nparameter space into low dimensional FF sub channels. Subsequently, the\nrelationship between channel approximation error and CE error with respect to\nthe number of sub blocks is derived, and the optimal number of sub blocks is\nsolved based on the criterion of minimizing the total error.

Unlike conventional simulation tools, the proposed framework\nsupports realistic coexistence analysis across DSRC and C-V2X technologies\noperating over shared spectrum. A dedicated interference tracking module\ncaptures cross-technology interference at the time-frequency resource block\nlevel and enhances signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) estimation by\neliminating artifacts such as the bimodal behavior induced by separate LoS/NLoS\npropagation models. Compared to field measurements, VaN3Twin reduces\napplication-layer disagreement by 50% in rural and over 70% in urban\nenvironments with respect to current state-of-the-art simulation tools,\ndemonstrating its value for scalable and accurate digital twin-based V2X\ncoexistence simulation."}

We focus on a\nchallenging scenario in which the direct links between the base station (BS)\nand all UEs are blocked, and communication is facilitated only via RISs. The\nmaximum ratio transmission (MRT) is utilized for data precoding, while a\nlow-complexity algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is designed\nto jointly perform beam selection, power allocation, and RIS profile\nconfiguration. The proposed optimization approach demonstrates positive\ntrade-offs between the complexity (in terms of running time) and the achievable\nsum rate. In addition, our results demonstrate that due to the sparsity of\nbeamspace channels, increasing the number of unit cells (UCs) at RISs can lead\nto higher achievable rates than activating a larger number of beams at the MIMO\nBS."}

Most current time series clustering methods handle only scalar time\nseries, treat them as white noise, or rely on domain knowledge for high-quality\nfeature construction, where the autocorrelation pattern/feature is mostly\nignored. Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the\nsystem identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by\nexplicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first\nderive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model.\nUnfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems. We then\nderive a `small-noise' limiting version of the algorithm, which we call k-LMVAR\n(Limiting Mixture Vector AutoRegression), that is computationally manageable.\nWe develop an associated BIC criterion for choosing the number of clusters and\nmodel order. The algorithm performs very well in comparative simulations and\nalso scales well computationally."}

GMT uses the volume integral equation\n(VIE) in the forward problem and assumes that the sample has negligible effect\non the coil currents. Consequently, GMT calculates the coil's incident fields\nwith an initial EP distribution and keeps them constant for all optimization\niterations. This can lead to erroneous reconstructions. This work introduces a\nnovel version of GMT that replaces VIE with the volume-surface integral\nequation (VSIE), which recalculates the coil currents at every iteration based\non updated EP estimates before computing the associated fields. Methods: We\nsimulated an 8-channel transceiver coil array for 7 T brain imaging and\nreconstructed the EP of a realistic head model using VSIE-based GMT. We built\nthe coil, collected experimental MR measurements, and reconstructed EP of a\ntwo-compartment phantom. Results: In simulations, VSIE-based GMT outperformed\nVIE-based GMT by at least 12% for both EP. In experiments, the relative\ndifference with respect to probe-measured EP values in the inner (outer)\ncompartment was 13% (26%) and 17% (33%) for the permittivity and conductivity,\nrespectively. Conclusion: The use of VSIE over VIE enhances GMT's performance\nby accounting for the effect of the EP on the coil currents. Significance:\nVSIE-based GMT does not rely on an initial EP estimate, rendering it more\nsuitable for experimental reconstructions compared to the VIE-based GMT."}

In this work, we take a step\ntoward a foundation model for communication data--a transformer-based,\nmulti-modal model designed to operate directly on communication data.
