### [1] [Brain2Vec: A Deep Learning Framework for EEG-Based Stress Detection Using CNN-LSTM-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11179)
*Md Mynoddin,Troyee Dev,Rishita Chakma*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Brain2Vec是一种结合卷积、循环和注意力机制的深度学习工具，用于从原始EEG信号分类压力状态，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康问题日益普遍，需要开发非侵入性工具来诊断压力状态。EEG信号虽然直接反映神经活动，但因其非稳定性和高维度特点，建模具有挑战性。

Method: 提出Brain2Vec模型，采用卷积层捕捉空间依赖、LSTM层建模时间序列，并结合注意力机制突出关键时间区域。在DEAP数据集上进行了预处理和评估。

Result: 模型在AUC得分为0.68，验证准确率达81.25%，优于传统CNN-LSTM基线。

Conclusion: Brain2Vec在可穿戴压力监测和个性化医疗系统中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and
overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive
diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window
into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature
poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep
learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a
hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The
model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial
dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,
and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal
regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass
filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM
baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation
accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for
integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized
healthcare systems.

### [2] [Design of 3D Beamforming and Deployment Strategies for ISAC-based HAPS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11294)
*Xue Zhang,Bang Huang,Mohamed-Slim Alouini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过集成传感与通信（ISAC）实现的高空平台站（HAPS）系统，优化HAPS部署策略和三维波束赋形以最大化通信用户吞吐量，同时满足SAR成像要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索HAPS在同时提供多用户通信和地面目标传感时的性能优化问题，特别是在SAR成像操作中。

Result: 数值结果表明所提方法在性能和效率上优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 通过优化HAPS部署和波束赋形，ISAC-HAPS系统能够高效支持通信和传感需求。

Abstract: This paper explores high-altitude platform station (HAPS) systems enabled by
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), in which a HAPS simultaneously
transmits communication signals and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging
signals to support multi-user communication while performing ground target
sensing. Taking into account the operational characteristics of SAR imaging, we
consider two HAPS deployment strategies: (i) a quasi-stationary HAPS that
remains fixed at an optimized location during SAR operation, following the
stop-and-go scanning model; and (ii) a dynamic HAPS that continuously adjusts
its flight trajectory along a circular path. For each strategy, we aim at
maximizing the weighted sum-rate throughput for communication users while
ensuring that SAR imaging requirements, such as beampattern gain and
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are satisfied. This is achieved by jointly
optimizing the HAPS deployment strategy, i.e., its placement or trajectory,
along with three-dimensional (3D) transmit beamforming, under practical
constraints including transmit power limits, energy consumption, and flight
dynamics. Nevertheless, the formulated optimization problems corresponding to
the two deployment strategies are inherently non-convex. To address the issue,
we propose efficient algorithms that leverage both convex and non-convex
optimization techniques to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approaches
over benchmark schemes.

### [3] [A Compact Dynamic Omnidirectional Antenna](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11351)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型全向天线设计，结合方向调制技术，用于安全的窄平面信息传输，具有紧凑尺寸和稳定的全向辐射性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决平面信息传输中的安全问题，提出一种结合方向调制技术的新型天线设计，以实现信息的安全传输和窄平面覆盖。

Method: 采用两个紧密排列的印刷曲折线单极天线作为单个辐射元件，通过差分功率激励和实时动态切换实现相位模式调制，从而在E平面形成窄信息可恢复区域。

Result: 实验结果显示，16-QAM传输时获得约34°的E平面信息束，256-QAM时缩小至15°，同时在H平面保持全向性。

Conclusion: 该天线设计为增强平面物理信息安全提供了一种简单且紧凑的动态天线系统解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel omnidirectional antenna design incorporating directional
modulation for secure narrow planar information transmission. The proposed
antenna features a compact size and stable omnidirectional radiation
performance by employing two tightly spaced, printed meander line monopole
antennas, acting as a single radiating element. To achieve a narrow information
secure region, the proposed antenna is fed by differential power excitation of
two ports with real-time dynamic switching. This leads to phase pattern
modulation only along the electrical polarization, resulting in directionally
confined information recoverable region in the E-plane, while maintaining
highly constant or static omnidirectional H-plane pattern, inducing a
$360^\circ$ information recoverable region. The dynamic antenna is designed and
fabricated on a single layer of Rogers RO4350B which provides a miniaturized
planar size of $0.36 \times 0.5 , \lambda_0^2$ at 2.7 GHz and easy integration.
To validate the wireless communication performance, the fabricated antenna is
directly fed with a 10 dB power ratio by a radio frequency (RF) switching
system and evaluated for 16-QAM and 256-QAM transmission in a high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
for 16-QAM transmission, a narrow E-plane information beam (IB) of
approximately $34^\circ$ and omnidirectional H-plane IB are obtained, and a
narrower E-plane IB is achieved around $15^\circ$ for 256-QAM. These results
confirm that the proposed antenna offers a simple yet effective approach to
enhance planar physical information security with a compact dynamic antenna
system.

### [4] [Movable-Antenna Array Enhanced Downlink NOMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11438)

Result: 仿真显示MA-NOMA系统显著优于固定天线（FPA）和传统正交多址（OMA）系统。

Conclusion: MA技术可显著提高NOMA系统的总速率性能。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has gained increasing attention in the field of wireless
communications due to its exceptional capability to proactively reconfigure
wireless channels via localized antenna movements. In this paper, we
investigate the resource allocation design for an MA array-enabled base station
serving multiple single-antenna users in a downlink non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) system. We aim to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly
optimizing the transmit beamforming and the positions of all MAs at the BS,
subject to the constraints of transmit power budget, finite antenna moving
region, and the conditions for successive interference cancellation decoding
rate. The formulated problem, inherently highly non-convex, is addressed by
successive convex approximation (SCA) and alternating optimization methods to
obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results unveil that the
proposed MA-enhanced downlink NOMA system can significantly improve the sum
rate performance compared to both the fixed-position antenna (FPA) system and
the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system.

### [5] [Joint Angle and Velocity-Estimation for Target Localization in Bistatic mmWave MIMO Radar in the Presence of Clutter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11497)
*Priyanka Maity,Suraj Srivastava,Aditya K. Jagannatham,Lajos Hanzo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用稀疏贝叶斯学习（SBL）的毫米波MIMO雷达目标定位方法，通过角度-多普勒域建模和超分辨率离网格SBL框架，提高目标参数估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在未知杂波环境下，毫米波MIMO雷达系统中目标参数（如AoD、AoA和速度）的高精度估计问题。

Method: 采用角度-多普勒域的三维稀疏性建模，结合SBL框架和超分辨率离网格技术，递归更新参数网格以提高估计精度。

Result: 仿真结果验证了所提方法优于现有算法，并能接近Cramér-Rao界和贝叶斯CRB的理论极限。

Conclusion: 所提出的SBL框架在目标参数估计中表现出色，尤其在处理离网格问题时具有显著优势。

Abstract: Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-aided target localization is conceived for a
bistatic mmWave MIMO radar system in the presence of unknown clutter, followed
by the development of an angle-Doppler (AD)-domain representation of the
target-plus-clutter echo model for accurate target parameter estimation. The
proposed algorithm exploits the three-dimensional (3D) sparsity arising in the
AD domain of the scattering scene and employs the powerful SBL framework for
the estimation of target parameters, such as the angle-of-departure (AoD),
angle-of-arrival (AoA) and velocity. To handle a practical scenario where the
actual target parameters typically deviate from their finite-resolution grid, a
super-resolution-based improved off-grid SBL framework is developed for
recursively updating the parameter grid, thereby progressively refining the
estimates. We also determine the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) and Bayesian CRB for
target parameter estimation in order to benchmark the estimation performance.
Our simulation results corroborate the superior performance of the proposed
approach in comparison to the existing algorithms, and also their ability to
approach the bounds derived.

### [6] [MMWiLoc: A Multi-Sensor Dataset and Robust Device-Free Localization Method Using Commercial Off-The-Shelf Millimeter Wave Wi-Fi Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11540)
*Wenbo Ding,Yang Li,Dongsheng Wang,Bin Zhao,Yunrong Zhu,Yibo Zhang,Yumeng Miao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于毫米波Wi-Fi的无设备定位方法MMWiLoc，包括多传感器数据集和新定位算法，实现了厘米级精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波Wi-Fi在无设备感知中潜力巨大，但缺乏相关定位方法。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出MMWiLoc，结合波束校准（使用期望最大化）和多尺度压缩感知定位，利用波束信噪比信息确定目标到达角。

Result: MMWiLoc实现厘米级精度，优于2.4GHz Wi-Fi系统，且与高精度雷达系统竞争。

Conclusion: MMWiLoc为毫米波Wi-Fi定位提供了高效解决方案，附带公开数据集和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: Device-free Wi-Fi sensing has numerous benefits in practical settings, as it
eliminates the requirement for dedicated sensing devices and can be
accomplished using current low-cost Wi-Fi devices. With the development of
Wi-Fi standards, millimeter wave Wi-Fi devices with 60GHz operating frequency
and up to 4GHz bandwidth have become commercially available. Although
millimeter wave Wi-Fi presents great promise for Device-Free Wi-Fi sensing with
increased bandwidth and beam-forming ability, there still lacks a method for
localization using millimeter wave Wi-Fi. Here, we present two major
contributions: First, we provide a comprehensive multi-sensor dataset that
synchronously captures human movement data from millimeter wave Wi-Fi, 2.4GHz
Wi-Fi, and millimeter wave radar sensors. This dataset enables direct
performance comparisons across different sensing modalities and facilitates
reproducible researches in indoor localization. Second, we introduce MMWiLoc, a
novel localization method that achieves centimeter-level precision with low
computational cost. MMWiLoc incorporates two components: beam pattern
calibration using Expectation Maximization and target localization through
Multi-Scale Compression Sensing. The system processes beam Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (beamSNR) information from the beam-forming process to determine target
Angle of Arrival (AoA), which is then fused across devices for localization.
Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that MMWiLoc achieves centimeter-level
precision, outperforming 2.4GHz Wi-Fi systems while maintaining competitive
performance with high-precision radar systems. The dataset and examples
processing code will be released after this paper is accepted at

Method: 通过利用同时发射和反射的可重构智能表面（STAR-RIS）优化多用户通信系统，最大化总能量效率（EE）。

Result: 研究发现STAR-RIS在码字长度较短且最大可容忍误码率较低时能效提升更为显著。

Conclusion: STAR-RIS在具有严格延迟和可靠性要求的系统中更具能效优势。

Abstract: Energy-efficient designs are proposed for multi-user (MU) multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channels (BC), assisted by simultaneously
transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)
operating at finite block length (FBL). In particular, we maximize the sum
energy efficiency (EE), showing that STAR-RIS can substantially enhance it. Our
findings demonstrate that the gains of employing STAR-RIS increase when the
codeword length and the maximum tolerable bit error rate decrease, meaning that
a STAR-RIS is more energy efficient in a system with more stringent latency and
reliability requirements.

Conclusion: FieldFormer提供了一种复杂度自适应的神经表示，能够灵活表示多样化的物理场，具有较高的实用价值。

Abstract: Reconstructing physical field tensors from \textit{in situ} observations,
such as radio maps and ocean sound speed fields, is crucial for enabling
environment-aware decision making in various applications, e.g., wireless
communications and underwater acoustics. Field data reconstruction is often
challenging, due to the limited and noisy nature of the observations,
necessitating the incorporation of prior information to aid the reconstruction
process. Deep neural network-based data-driven structural constraints (e.g.,
``deeply learned priors'') have showed promising performance. However, this
family of techniques faces challenges such as model mismatches between training
and testing phases. This work introduces FieldFormer, a self-supervised neural
prior learned solely from the limited {\it in situ} observations without the
need of offline training. Specifically, the proposed framework starts with
modeling the fields of interest using the tensor Tucker model of a high
multilinear rank, which ensures a universal approximation property for all
fields. In the sequel, an attention mechanism is incorporated to learn the
sparsity pattern that underlies the core tensor in order to reduce the solution
space.
  In this way, a ``complexity-adaptive'' neural representation, grounded in the
Tucker decomposition, is obtained that can flexibly represent
  various types of fields. A theoretical analysis is provided to support the
recoverability of the proposed design. Moreover, extensive experiments, using
various physical field tensors, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的随机动态系统常偏离卡尔曼滤波的线性高斯假设，需要数据驱动的滤波技术。

Method: 结合递归约瑟夫公式传播误差协方差，并优化高斯负对数似然。

Result: 在非高斯测量白噪声下，性能优于传统卡尔曼滤波和现有深度学习估计器。

Conclusion: Recursive KalmanNet为复杂噪声条件下的状态估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State estimation in stochastic dynamical systems with noisy measurements is a
challenge. While the Kalman filter is optimal for linear systems with
independent Gaussian white noise, real-world conditions often deviate from
these assumptions, prompting the rise of data-driven filtering techniques. This
paper introduces Recursive KalmanNet, a Kalman-filter-informed recurrent neural
network designed for accurate state estimation with consistent error covariance
quantification. Our approach propagates error covariance using the recursive
Joseph's formula and optimizes the Gaussian negative log-likelihood.
Experiments with non-Gaussian measurement white noise demonstrate that our
model outperforms both the conventional Kalman filter and an existing
state-of-the-art deep learning based estimator.

Abstract: Future wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems will integrate
both sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands to meet the growing
demands for high data rates. MIMO link establishment typically requires
accurate channel estimation, which is particularly challenging at mmWave
frequencies due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we
propose two novel deep learning-based methods for estimating mmWave MIMO
channels by leveraging out-of-band information from the sub-6 GHz band. The
first method employs a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the second
method utilizes a UNet architecture. We compare these proposed methods against
deep-learning methods that rely solely on in-band information and with other
state-of-the-art out-of-band aided methods. Simulation results show that our
proposed out-of-band aided deep-learning methods outperform existing
alternatives in terms of achievable spectral efficiency.

coexisting SemCom and BitCom users. Furthermore, we examine multi-modal SemCom
frameworks for handling diverse data types and discuss their applications in
satellite networks, where semantic techniques mitigate bandwidth limitations

deploying semantic-aware systems in 6G and beyond.

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which
complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a
diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based
anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited
generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional
evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the
reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate
inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification
using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average
$W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method
by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability,
supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy
and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method
enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG
monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and
wearable ECG applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates robust transmit (TX) beamforming from the satellite
to user terminals (UTs), based on statistical channel state information (CSI).
The proposed design specifically targets the mitigation of
satellite-to-terrestrial interference in spectrum-sharing integrated
terrestrial and satellite networks. By leveraging the distribution information
of terrestrial UTs, we first establish an interference model from the satellite
to terrestrial systems without shared CSI. Based on this, robust TX beamforming
schemes are developed under both the interference threshold and the power
budget. Two optimization criteria are considered: satellite weighted sum rate
maximization and mean square error minimization. The former achieves a superior
achievable rate performance through an iterative optimization framework,
whereas the latter enables a low-complexity closed-form solution at the expense
of reduced rate, with interference constraints satisfied via a bisection
method. To avoid complex integral calculations and the dependence on user
distribution information in inter-system interference evaluations, we propose a
terrestrial base station position-aided approximation method, and the
approximation errors are subsequently analyzed. Numerical simulations validate
the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于上行DMRS的多用户MIMO系统信道估计，提出了一种基于统计信道状态信息（SCSI）的贝叶斯估计器（SA-BCE）及其低复杂度窗口版本（SA-WBCE），并通过位置特定的SCSI数据库提升性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多用户MIMO系统用户数量的增加，需要高效的多路参考信号（DMRS）正交覆盖码（OCC）设计以减少干扰。本文旨在通过利用位置特定的SCSI提升信道估计性能。

Method: 提出SCSI辅助的贝叶斯信道估计器（SA-BCE）及其窗口版本（SA-WBCE），通过天线-频率域窗口和波束-时延域处理降低复杂度，并构建网格化SCSI数据库以减少实时计算负载。

Conclusion: 基于SCSI的信道估计方法在性能和复杂度之间实现了良好平衡，为多用户MIMO系统的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the growing number of users in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) systems, demodulation reference signals (DMRSs) are efficiently
multiplexed in the code domain via orthogonal cover codes (OCC) to ensure
orthogonality and minimize pilot interference. In this paper, we investigate
uplink DMRS-based channel estimation for MU-MIMO systems with Type II OCC
pattern standardized in 3GPP Release 18, leveraging location-specific
statistical channel state information (SCSI) to enhance performance.
Specifically, we propose a SCSI-assisted Bayesian channel estimator (SA-BCE)
based on the minimum mean square error criterion to suppress the pilot
interference and noise, albeit at the cost of cubic computational complexity
due to matrix inversions. To reduce this complexity while maintaining
performance, we extend the scheme to a windowed version (SA-WBCE), which
incorporates antenna-frequency domain windowing and beam-delay domain
processing to exploit asymptotic sparsity and mitigate energy leakage in
practical systems. To avoid the frequent real-time SCSI acquisition, we
construct a grid-based location-specific SCSI database based on the principle
of spatial consistency, and subsequently leverage the uplink received signals
within each grid to extract the SCSI. Facilitated by the multilinear structure
of wireless channels, we formulate the SCSI acquisition problem within each
grid as a tensor decomposition problem, where the factor matrices are
parameterized by the multi-path powers, delays, and angles. The computational
complexity of SCSI acquisition can be significantly reduced by exploiting the
Vandermonde structure of the factor matrices. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed location-specific SCSI database construction method achieves
high accuracy, while the SA-BCE and SA-WBCE significantly outperform
state-of-the-art benchmarks in MU-MIMO systems.

Abstract: We study the problem of uplink compression for cell-free multi-input
multi-output networks with limited fronthaul capacity. In compress-forward
mode, remote radio heads (RRHs) compress the received signal and forward it to
a central unit for joint processing. While previous work has focused on a
transform-based approach, which optimizes the transform matrix that reduces
signals of high dimension to a static pre-determined lower dimension, we
propose a rate-based approach that simultaneously finds both dimension and
compression adaptively. Our approach accommodates for changes to network
traffic and fronthaul limits. Using mutual information as the objective, we
obtain the theoretical network capacity for adaptive compression and decouple
the expression to enable decentralization. Furthermore, using channel
statistics and user traffic density, we show different approaches to compute an
efficient representation of side information that summarizes global channel
state information and is shared with RRHs to assist compression. While keeping
the information exchange overhead low, our decentralized implementation of
adaptive compression shows competitive overall network performance compared to
a centralized approach.

TL;DR: 论文研究了间歇性和移动性声源的跟踪问题，提出了LibriJump数据集和新的跟踪关联度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跟踪方法通常依赖连续的空间观察进行轨迹管理，但很少研究声源在静默期间改变位置的情况。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了LibriJump数据集（基于First Order Ambisonics格式），并引入计算机视觉中的跟踪关联度量方法来评估身份分配性能。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的关联度量方法与现有跟踪指标在连续和非连续空间轨迹上具有互补性。

Conclusion: 论文为解决非连续空间轨迹中的声源跟踪问题提供了新方法，并验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents the problem of tracking intermittent and moving sources,
i.e, sources that may change position when they are inactive. This issue is
seldom explored, and most current tracking methods rely on spatial observations
for track identity management. They are either based on a previous localization
step, or designed to perform joint localization and tracking by predicting
ordered position estimates. This raises concerns about whether such methods can
maintain reliable track identity assignment performance when dealing with
discontinuous spatial tracks, which may be caused by a change of direction
during silence. We introduce LibriJump, a novel dataset of acoustic scenes in
the First Order Ambisonics format focusing on speaker tracking. The dataset
contains speakers with changing positions during inactivity periods, thus
simulating discontinuous tracks. To measure the identity assignment
performance, we propose to use tracking association metrics adapted from the
computer vision community. We provide experiments showing the complementarity
of association metrics with previously used tracking metrics, given continuous
and discontinuous spatial tracks.

Abstract: With advancements in automotive electronics and sensors, the sound pick-up
using multiple microphones has become feasible for hands-free telephony and
voice command in-car applications. However, challenges remain in effectively
processing multiple microphone signals due to bandwidth or processing
limitations. This work explores the use of the Multichannel Wiener Filter
algorithm with a two-microphone in-car system, to enhance speech quality for
driver and passenger voice, i.e., to mitigate notch-filtering effects caused by
echoes and improve background noise reduction. We evaluate its performance
under various noise conditions using modern objective metrics like Deep Noise
Suppression Mean Opinion Score. The effect of head movements of
driver/passenger is also investigated. The proposed method is shown to provide
significant improvements over a simple mixing of microphone signals.

Abstract: Measuring room impulse responses (RIRs) at multiple spatial points is a
time-consuming task, while simulations require detailed knowledge of the room's
acoustic environment. In prior work, we proposed a method for estimating the
early part of RIRs along a linear trajectory in a time-varying acoustic
scenario involving a static sound source and a microphone moving at constant
velocity. This approach relies on measured RIRs at the start and end points of
the trajectory and assumes that the time intervals occupied by the direct sound
and individual reflections along the trajectory are non-overlapping. The
method's applicability is therefore restricted to relatively small areas within
a room, and its performance has yet to be validated with real-world data. In
this paper, we propose a practical extension of the method to more realistic
scenarios by segmenting longer trajectories into smaller linear intervals where
the assumptions approximately hold. Applying the method piecewise along these
segments extends its applicability to more complex room environments. We
demonstrate its effectiveness using the trajectoRIR database, which includes
moving microphone recordings and RIR measurements at discrete points along a
controlled L-shaped trajectory in a real room.

Result: 在Widar3.0和XRF55数据集上的实验表明,该方法性能优越。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态协作感知方法通过特征融合显著提升了行为识别准确性。

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

Conclusion: CoM2S方法有效，将开源代码和数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Voiced Electromyography (EMG)-to-Speech (V-ETS) models reconstruct speech
from muscle activity signals, facilitating applications such as
neurolaryngologic diagnostics. Despite its potential, the advancement of V-ETS
is hindered by a scarcity of paired EMG-speech data. To address this, we
propose a novel Confidence-based Multi-Speaker Self-training (CoM2S) approach,
along with a newly curated Libri-EMG dataset. This approach leverages synthetic
EMG data generated by a pre-trained model, followed by a proposed filtering
mechanism based on phoneme-level confidence to enhance the ETS model through
the proposed self-training techniques. Experiments demonstrate our method
improves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word
error rate, confirming the effectiveness of our CoM2S approach for V-ETS. In
support of future research, we will release the codes and the proposed
Libri-EMG dataset-an open-access, time-aligned, multi-speaker voiced EMG and
speech recordings.

Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac
arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains
challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by
differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population

four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected
from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom
architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each
experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on
the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data
reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization
across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable
intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,
robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and
predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise
statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,
real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and
missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting
conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering
methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering
proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and
propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference
frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation
techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To
validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations
and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D
point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The
fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with
possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning
pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing
challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with
outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.
