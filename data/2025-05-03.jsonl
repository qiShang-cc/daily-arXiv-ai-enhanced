In this paper, a novel adjustable power radiation model\nis proposed for PASS, where power radiation ratios of pinching antennas can be\nflexibly controlled by tuning the spacing between pinching antennas and\nwaveguides. A closed-form pinching antenna spacing arrangement strategy is\nderived to achieve the commonly assumed equal-power radiation. Based on this, a\npractical PASS framework relying on discrete activation is considered, where\npinching antennas can only be activated among a set of predefined locations. A\ntransmit power minimization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the\ntransmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and the numbers of activated\npinching antennas, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. (1) To\nsolve the resulting highly coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)\nproblem, branch-and-bound (BnB)-based algorithms are proposed for both\nsingle-user and multi-user scenarios, which is guaranteed to converge to\nglobally optimal solutions. (2) A low-complexity many-to-many matching\nalgorithm is further developed. Combined with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)\ntheory, locally optimal and pairwise-stable solutions are obtained within\npolynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that: (i) PASS\nsignificantly outperforms conventional multi-antenna architectures,\nparticularly when the number of users and the spatial range increase; and (ii)\nThe proposed matching-based algorithm achieves near-optimal performance,\nresulting in only a slight performance loss while significantly reducing\ncomputational overheads.

Performance evaluation shows encouraging\nresults with improved detection probabilities and bit error rates (BERs), in up\nto five warden cases, compared to noise injection and single-discriminator\nbaselines.
