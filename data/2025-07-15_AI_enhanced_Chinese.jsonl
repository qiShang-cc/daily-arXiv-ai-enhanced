However, a significant\nchallenge in bistatic cooperative sensing is clock asynchronism, arising from\nthe use of different clocks at far separated transmitters and receivers. This\nasynchrony leads to Timing Offsets (TOs) and Carrier Frequency Offsets (CFOs),\npotentially causing sensing ambiguity. Traditional synchronization methods\ntypically rely on static reference links or GNSS-based timing sources, both of\nwhich are often unreliable or unavailable in UAVbased bistatic ISAC scenarios.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a Time-Varying Offset Estimation\n(TVOE) framework tailored for clock-asynchronous bistatic ISAC systems, which\nleverages the geometrically predictable characteristics of the Line-of-Sight\n(LoS) path to enable robust, infrastructure-free\n  synchronization. The framework treats the LoS delay and the Doppler shift as\ndynamic observations and models their evolution as a hidden stochastic process.\nA state-space formulation is developed to jointly estimate TO and CFO via an\nExtended Kalman Filter (EKF), enabling real-time tracking of clock offsets\nacross successive frames. Furthermore, the estimated offsets are subsequently\napplied to correct the timing misalignment of all Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS)\ncomponents, thereby enhancing the high-resolution target sensing performance.\nExtensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TVOE method improves\nthe estimation accuracy by 60%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u65f6\u949f\u5f02\u6b65\u7684\u53cc\u57fa\u5730ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u504f\u79fb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08TVOE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u5b9a\u65f6\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u57fa\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5982B5G/6G\uff09\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u6536\u53d1\u4fe1\u673a\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u5f02\u6b65\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9a\u65f6\u548c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTVOE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u8ddd\u8def\u5f84\uff08LoS\uff09\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08EKF\uff09\u5b9e\u65f6\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\uff08NLoS\uff09\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9a\u65f6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTVOE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8660%\u3002", "conclusion": "TVOE\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u65f6\u949f\u5f02\u6b65\u53cc\u57fa\u5730ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To further release the potential of HNOMA, this paper\nproposes a novel design of H-NOMA which jointly incorporates hybrid successive\ninterference cancellation (HSIC) and power adaptation (PA) in the NOMA\ntransmission phase. To reveal the potential of the proposed HSIC-PA aided\nH-NOMA scheme, closed-form expression for the probability of the event that\nH-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate than pure OMA by consuming less energy is\nrigorously derived. Furthermore, the asymptotic analysis demonstrates that the\nprobability of the proposed H-NOMA scheme approaches 1 in the high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime without any constraints on either users'\ntarget rates or transmit power ratios. This represents a significant\nimprovement over conventional H-NOMA schemes, which require specific\nrestrictive conditions to achieve probability 1 at high SNRs as shown in\nexisting work. The above observation indicates that with less energy\nconsumption, the proposed HSIC-PA aided H-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate\nthan pure OMA with probability 1 at high SNRs, and hence a higher energy\nefficiency.

As the underlying structures can change over\ntime, the tracking dynamic graph topologies from observed signals is a\nfundamental challenge in graph signal processing (GSP), with applications in\nvarious domains, such as power systems, the brain-machine interface, and\ncommunication systems. In this paper, we propose a method for tracking dynamic\nchanges in graph topologies. Our approach builds on a representation of the\ndynamics as a graph-based nonlinear state-space model (SSM), where the\nobservations are graph signals generated through graph filtering, and the\nunderlying evolving topology serves as the latent states. In our formulation,\nthe graph Laplacian matrix is parameterized using the incidence matrix and edge\nweights, enabling a structured representation of the state.

To this end, this paper\nproposes a novel secure framework named CovertAuth, designed to enhance the\nsecurity of the BA phase against such attacks. In particular, to combat\neavesdropping attacks, the closed-form expressions of successful BA probability\nand covert transmission rate are first derived. Then, a covert communication\nproblem aimed at jointly optimizing beam training budget and transmission power\nis formulated to maximize covert communication rate, subject to the covertness\nrequirement. An alternating optimization algorithm combined with successive\nconvex approximation is employed to iteratively achieve optimal results. To\ncombat impersonation attacks, the mutual coupling effect of antenna array\nimpairments is explored as a device feature to design a weighted-sum energy\ndetector based physical layer authentication scheme. Moreover, theoretical\nmodels for authentication metrics like detection and false alarm probabilities\nare also provided to conduct performance analysis.

First, we define and evaluate\nkey network metrics-including dropped task ratio and bandwidth\nutilization-while maintaining service continuity by accounting for the existing\ncommitments of the edge server to previously offloaded tasks. Then, we propose\na jamming-aware offloading and RB allocation framework that leverages\ntransmission diversity and optimal scheduling across distributed gNBs. The\nproposed solution is compared to a similar scenario without transmission\ndiversity and two baseline strategies of first-come-first-served (FCFS) and\nshortest task first (STF). The proposed algorithm effectively mitigates the\nimpact of jamming while enhancing resource utilization and minimizing task drop\nrates, making it highly suitable for mission-critical MEC applications. At\nsignal-to-jamming-and-noise ratio (SJNR) of 4 dB, the proposed method achieves\na $0.26$ task drop rate, outperforming the scenario without transmission\ndiversity with a task drop rate of 0.50 and STF and FCFS strategies with 0.52\nand 0.63 task drop rates, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001MEC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u8f93\u591a\u6837\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u4e22\u5f03\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08MEC\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u653e\u5728\u9760\u8fd1\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u5230\u8fbe\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5e72\u6270\uff08\u5982\u5e72\u6270\uff09\u4f7f\u5f97\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u53d8\u5f97\u590d\u6742\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u5bf9\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7f51\u7edc\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4efb\u52a1\u4e22\u5f03\u7387\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5bf9\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u8f93\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u611f\u77e5\u5378\u8f7d\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5757\uff08RB\uff09\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fgNBs\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e72\u6270\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\uff08SJNR\uff09\u4e3a4 dB\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e22\u5f03\u7387\u4e3a0.26\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u4f20\u8f93\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff080.50\uff09\u4ee5\u53caFCFS\uff080.63\uff09\u548cSTF\uff080.52\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u7684MEC\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

SIMs benefit from\nflexible spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) while reducing the requirement for\ncostly radio-frequency (RF) chains.

To address these aspects, we propose\nincorporating meta-fibers into SIMs, with the aim of reducing the number of\nlayers and enhancing the energy efficiency. First, we introduce a\nmeta-fiber-connected 2-layer SIM that exhibits the same flexible signal\nprocessing capabilities as conventional multi-layer structures, and explains\nthe operating principle. Subsequently, we formulate and solve the optimization\nproblem of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the SIM channel and\nthe desired channel matrices. Specifically, by designing the phase shifts of\nthe meta-atoms associated with the transmitting-SIM and receiving-SIM, a\nnon-interference system with parallel subchannels is established. In order to\nreduce the computational complexity, a closed-form expression for each phase\nshift at each iteration of an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is\nproposed. We show that the proposed algorithm is applicable to conventional\nmulti-layer SIMs. The channel capacity bound and computational complexity are\nanalyzed to provide design insights.

The signed graph is\nthen learned by formulating a non-convex optimization problem where the total\nvariation of the observed signals is minimized with respect to the net\nLaplacian. The proposed problem is solved using alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) and a fast algorithm reducing the per-ADMM iteration\ncomplexity from quadratic to linear in the number of nodes is introduced.\nFurthermore, theoretical proofs of convergence for the algorithm and a bound on\nthe estimation error of the learned net Laplacian as a function of sample size,\nnumber of nodes, and graph topology are provided. Finally, the proposed method\nis evaluated on simulated data and gene regulatory network inference problem\nand compared to existing signed graph learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5e73\u6ed1\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u51c0\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u77e9\u9635\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u79fb\u4f4d\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528ADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u65e0\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u751f\u7269\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u7528\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51c0\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u77e9\u9635\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u79fb\u4f4d\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e73\u6ed1\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u548c\u57fa\u56e0\u8c03\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

IEEE\n  retains copyright", "summary": "Acoustic beamforming models typically assume wide-sense stationarity of\nspeech signals within short time frames. However, voiced speech is better\nmodeled as a cyclostationary (CS) process, a random process whose mean and\nautocorrelation are $T_1$-periodic, where $\\alpha_1=1/T_1$ corresponds to the\nfundamental frequency of vowels. Higher harmonic frequencies are found at\ninteger multiples of the fundamental. This work introduces a cyclic\nmultichannel Wiener filter (cMWF) for speech enhancement derived from a\ncyclostationary model.

Despite many years of research, however, the debate on the\nmost appropriate statistical model for speech still continues. Speech is\ncommonly modeled as a wide-sense stationary (WSS) process. However, the use of\nthe WSS model for spectrally correlated processes is fundamentally wrong, as\nWSS implies spectral uncorrelation. In this paper, we demonstrate that voiced\nspeech can be more accurately represented as a cyclostationary (CS) process. By\nemploying the CS rather than the WSS model for processes that are inherently\ncorrelated across frequency, it is possible to improve the estimation of\ncross-power spectral densities (PSDs), source separation, and beamforming.
