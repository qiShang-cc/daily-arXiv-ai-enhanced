Since human gesture motion\ninduces subtle and random variations in wireless multipath propagation, how to\naccurately model human gesture channels has become a crucial issue for the\ndesign and validation of ISAC systems. To this end, this paper proposes a deep\nlearning-based human gesture channel modeling framework for ISAC scenarios, in\nwhich the human body is decomposed into multiple body parts, and the mapping\nbetween human gestures and their corresponding multipath characteristics is\nlearned from real-world measurements. Specifically, a Poisson neural network is\nemployed to predict the number of Multi-Path Components (MPCs) for each human\nbody part, while Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (C-VAEs) are reused to\ngenerate the scattering points, which are further used to reconstruct\ncontinuous channel impulse responses and micro-Doppler signatures. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and\ngeneralization across different gestures and subjects, providing an\ninterpretable approach for data augmentation and the evaluation of\ngesture-based ISAC systems."}

To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged\nO-RAN and AI-RAN architecture that unifies orchestration and management of both\ntelecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed\narchitecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and\ncloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments. We introduce two key\narchitectural innovations: (i) the AI-RAN Orchestrator, which extends the O-RAN\nService Management and Orchestration (SMO) to enable integrated resource and\nallocation across RAN and AI workloads; and (ii) AI-RAN sites that provide\ndistributed edge AI platforms with real-time processing capabilities. The\nproposed system supports flexible deployment options, allowing AI workloads to\nbe orchestrated with specific timing requirements (real-time or batch\nprocessing) and geographic targeting. The proposed architecture addresses the\norchestration requirements for managing heterogeneous workloads at different\ntime scales while maintaining open, standardized interfaces and multi-vendor\ninteroperability."}

These channels are utilized in highly mobile networks\nsuch as cognitive vehicular networks (CVN). In addition, an eavesdropper aims\nto intercept the communications between secondary users (SUs). The SU receiver\nhas full-duplex and energy harvesting capabilities to generate jamming signals\nto confound the eavesdropper and enhance security. Moreover, the SU transmitter\nextracts energy from ambient radio frequency signals in order to power\nsubsequent transmissions to its intended receiver. To optimize the privacy and\nreliability of the SUs in a CVN, a deep Q-network (DQN) strategy is utilized\nwhere multiple DQN agents are required such that an agent is assigned at each\nSU transmitter. The objective for the SUs is to determine the optimal\ntransmission power and decide whether to collect energy or transmit messages\nduring each time period in order to maximize their secrecy rate. Thereafter, we\npropose a DQN approach to maximize the throughput of the SUs while respecting\nthe interference threshold acceptable at the receiver of the primary user.\nAccording to our findings, our strategy outperforms two other baseline\nstrategies in terms of security and reliability."}

In the realm of CRNs, this paper\ninvestigates the energy efficiency issue and addresses the critical challenge\nof optimizing system reliability for overlay CRN access mode. Randomly\ndispersed secondary users (SUs) serving as relays for primary users (PUs) are\nconsidered, in which one of these relays is designated to harvest energy\nthrough the time switching-energy harvesting (EH) protocol. Moreover, this\nrelay amplifies-and-forwards (AF) the PU's messages and broadcasts them along\nwith its own across cascaded $\\kappa$-$\\mu$ fading channels. The power\nsplitting protocol is another EH approach utilized by the SU and PU receivers\nto enhance the amount of energy in their storage devices. In addition, the SU\ntransmitters and the SU receiver are deployed with multiple antennas for\nreception and apply the maximal ratio combining approach. The outage\nprobability is utilized to assess both networks' reliability. Then, an energy\nefficiency evaluation is performed to determine the effectiveness of EH on the\nsystem. Finally, an optimization problem is provided with the goal of\nmaximizing the data rate of the SUs by optimizing the time switching and the\npower allocation parameters of the SU relay."}

However, CL and, more\nbroadly, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often demand a large amount of\ndata and computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on\nresource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility and\nefficiency of SSL techniques for edge-based learning, focusing on trade-offs\nbetween model performance and energy efficiency. In particular, we analyze how\ndifferent SSL techniques adapt to limited computational, data, and energy\nbudgets, evaluating their effectiveness in learning robust representations\nunder resource-constrained settings. Moreover, we also consider the energy\ncosts involved in labeling data and assess how semi-supervised learning may\nassist in reducing the overall energy consumed to train CL models. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that tailored SSL strategies can achieve\ncompetitive performance while reducing resource consumption by up to 4X,\nunderscoring their potential for energy-efficient learning at the edge."}

A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a\nmicrophone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase\ntransform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone\npairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of\nmicrophone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of\nmicrophone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently\na more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs\nby computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT\nfunction reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on\nthe TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT\nfunctions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral\ndensities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we\nincrease the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs\ncomputed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals\nrecorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially\ndistributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in\nterms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error.\nExperimental results for different source and microphone configurations and\nthree reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering\nmultiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation\naccuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely\non a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position\nestimation."}
