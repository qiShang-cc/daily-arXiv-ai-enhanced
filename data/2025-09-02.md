### [1] [A Framework of Arithmetic-Level Variable Precision Computing for In-Memory Architecture: Case Study in MIMO Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21079)
*Kaixuan Bao,Wei Xu,Xiaohu You,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于可变精度计算（AL-VPC）的统一框架，通过优化算术运算的精度，平衡计算性能与计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信中的计算复杂度问题是一个主要挑战，现有方法多针对特定算法，而计算精度这一关键维度较少被探索。

Method: 开发了算术传播误差模型，并提出离线VPC和在线VPC两种算法来解决优化问题。

Result: 在ZF预编码案例中，AL-VPC相比传统固定精度方法，可实现60%的总速率提升或30%的复杂度降低。

Conclusion: AL-VPC框架能有效优化计算精度，显著提升性能或降低复杂度，为无线通信系统提供新思路。

Abstract: Computational complexity poses a significant challenge in wireless
communication. Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through
algorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which
directly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is
a dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the
emerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing
(VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a
distinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we
establish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing
(AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each
arithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model
exploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization
problem to strike balance between computing performance and computational
complexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to
solve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a
case study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary
between computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60%
sum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared
to the traditional fixed-length methods.

### [2] [Hybrid Codebook Design for Localization Using Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21351)
*Alireza Fadakar,Yuchen Zhang,Hui Chen,Musa Furkan Keskin,Henk Wymeersch,Andreas F. Molisch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了电磁可重构流体天线系统（ER-FAS）在定位技术中的应用，通过动态控制天线辐射模式提升定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过电磁可重构技术增强下行链路定位能力，突破传统非可重构天线的限制。

Method: 提出了两种重构范式（综合模型和有限状态选择模型），并设计了联合基带和电磁预编码器方案。

Result: 所提出的ER-FAS方案显著提升了用户设备的定位准确性。

Conclusion: ER-FAS在定位领域具有显著潜力，未来可扩展至更复杂的无线通信场景。

Abstract: Electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (ER-FAS) introduce
additional degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain by dynamically
steering per-antenna radiation patterns, thereby enhancing power efficiency in
wireless links. Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which
adjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM
characteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing
studies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores
its application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station
serves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability
paradigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired
beampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state
selection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set
of patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM
precoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case
we derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM
precoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and
propose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern
selection. Analytical bounds and extensive simulations show that the proposed
hybrid designs for ER-FAS substantially improve UE positioning accuracy over
traditional non-reconfigurable arrays.

### [3] [Channel Estimation and Data Detection in DS-Spread Channels: A Unified Framework, Novel Algorithms, and Waveform Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21373)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的水下声学通信接收处理框架，用于延迟-尺度扩散信道（DS-spread）的通信，涵盖了信道估计（CE）和数据检测，支持多种调制波形（OFDM、OTFS、OCDM、ODSS）。通过开发新型变分贝叶斯算法和低复杂度检测方案，比较了不同波形性能。结果表明，在复杂度受限时波形选择关键，而采用高级算法后性能差异消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下声学通信中延迟-尺度扩散信道（DS-spread）的复杂性要求统一的处理框架和高效的信道估计与数据检测方法。作者旨在比较多种波形性能，并为复杂信道提供有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出统一接收处理框架，支持OFDM、OTFS、OCDM、ODSS调制波形；开发了迭代变分贝叶斯离格CE算法（FVB和SVB）和低复杂度变分软符号检测（VSSD）算法；提出数据辅助迭代CE与检测（ICED）方案。

Result: 数值实验验证了算法的有效性。未编码通信中，ODSS性能最优，OFDM最差；编码通信中采用VSSD后各波形性能接近。结果表明，在复杂度受限时波形选择重要，但高级算法可消除差异。

Conclusion: 在复杂度受限的接收器中，波形选择对性能影响显著，尤其在恶劣信道下。而采用更复杂的接收算法后，各波形性能趋于一致，差异消失。

Abstract: We present a unified receiver processing framework for communication over
delay-scale (DS)-spread channels that arise in underwater acoustic (UWA)
communications that addresses both channel estimation (CE) and data detection
for different modulation waveforms, namely OFDM, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS, through
a common input--output relation. Using this framework, we conduct a fair and
comprehensive comparative study of these waveforms under DS-spread UWA channels
and similar receiver complexities.
  We also develop a novel iterative variational Bayesian (VB) off-grid CE
algorithm to estimate the delay and scale parameters of the channel paths, via
two approaches: a first-order approximation scheme (FVB) and a second-order
approximation scheme (SVB). We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol
detection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios
for the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED)
scheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \emph{virtual} pilots to further
improve the CE and data detection accuracy.
  Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE
and data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in
uncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier
equalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while
OFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS
perform similarly, and they outperform OFDM. With coded communications,
interestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver
is employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is
constrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel
conditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these
differences disappear.

### [4] [Sampling Theory of Jointly Bandlimited Time-vertex Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21412)
*Hang Sheng,Hui Feng,Junhao Yu,Feng Ji,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了时间-顶点图信号（TVGS）的临界采样问题，推导了采样密度或采样比的下界，并提出了适用于不同类型TVGS的采样与重建方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 证明了采样密度或采样比的下界，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 证明了临界采样的可行性，并展示了其在数值和真实数据集中的应用。

Abstract: Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with
irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In
this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including
continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences
in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited
TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which
depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or
sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To
demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and
reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how
the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real
datasets.

### [5] [Subset Random Sampling and Reconstruction of Finite Time-Vertex Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21415)
*Hang Sheng,Qinji Shu,Hui Feng,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了针对有限时间-顶点图信号（FTVGS）的子集随机采样方案，支持在未知频谱支持下的高效重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机采样方法在实际应用中不够友好，因采样通常需限于部分顶点和时间点，因此需研究适用于未知频谱支持的采样与重构方法。

Method: 提出子集随机采样方案，先在行列中随机选择子矩阵，再在子矩阵内随机采样，并结合低秩、稀疏与平滑先验（LSSP）进行重构。

Result: 理论证明了高概率重构的充分条件，实验验证了重构的可行性与LSSP框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 子集随机采样方案及LSSP框架为FTVGS的未知频谱支持下的重构提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Finite time-vertex graph signals (FTVGS) provide an efficient representation
for capturing spatio-temporal correlations across multiple data sources on
irregular structures. Although sampling and reconstruction of FTVGS with known
spectral support have been extensively studied, the case of unknown spectral
support requires further investigation. Existing random sampling methods may
extract samples from any vertex at any time, but such strategies are not
friendly in practice, where sampling is typically limited to a subset of
vertices and moments. To address this requirement, we propose a subset random
sampling scheme for FTVGS. Specifically, we first randomly select a subset of
rows and columns to form a submatrix, followed by random sampling within that
submatrix. In theory, we provide sufficient conditions for reconstructing the
original FTVGS with high probability. Additionally, we introduce a
reconstruction framework incorporating low-rank, sparsity, and smoothness
priors (LSSP), and verify the feasibility of the reconstruction and the
effectiveness of the framework through experiments.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了名为多项式封闭模型（PCFM）的封闭形式GN/EGN模型，通过多项式表达通道的空间功率分布，提高了可靠性、准确性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超快且准确的物理层模型对超宽带光传输系统的设计、优化和管理至关重要。

Method: 通过多项式表达每个通道沿跨段的空间功率分布，并在合理近似下进行积分计算，支持任意多项式阶数。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多频段（C+L+S）场景中验证了模型的准确性，包括拉曼放大和通道间拉曼散射。

Conclusion: PCFM模型展示了高精度和广泛适用性，并提供可配置的软件实现。

Abstract: Ultrafast and accurate physical layer models are essential for designing,
optimizing and managing ultra-wideband optical transmission systems. We present
a closed-form GN/EGN model, named Polynomial Closed-Form Model (PCFM),
improving reliability, accuracy, and generality. The key to deriving PCFM is
expressing the spatial power profile of each channel along a span as a
polynomial. Then, under reasonable approximations, the integral calculation can
be carried out analytically, for any chosen degree of the polynomial. We
present a full detailed derivation of the model. We then validate it vs. the
numerically integrated GN-model in a challenging multiband (C+L+S) scenario,
including Raman amplification and inter-channel Raman scattering. We then show
that the approach works well also in the special case of the presence of
multiple lumped loss along the fiber. Overall, the approach shows very good
accuracy and broad applicability. A software implementing the model, fully
reconfigurable to any type of system layout, is available for download under

### [7] [Energy Detection over Composite $κ-μ$ Shadowed Fading Channels with Inverse Gaussian Distribution in Ultra mMTC Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21614)
*He Huang,Zeping Sui,Zilong Liu,Wei Huang,Md. Noor-A-Rahim,Haishi Wang,Zhiheng Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了在6G超机器类型通信网络中，基于κ-μ阴影衰落信道的能量检测特性，首次提出了一种基于截断的平均检测概率闭式表达式，并通过模拟发现传播路径数对检测概率的影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究能量检测在6G mMTC网络中的性能，特别是在κ-μ阴影衰落信道下的表现，为网络设计提供新思路。

Method: 基于逆高斯分布推导了SNR的PDF闭式表达式，并通过新颖的积分和数学变换技术首次提出了截断式的平均检测概率闭式表达式。

Result: 模拟结果显示，传播路径数对平均检测概率的影响比平均SNR更显著，这与以往研究不同。

Conclusion: 建议6G mMTC网络设计应优化收发器布局和天线对准策略，而非单纯依赖提高平均SNR。

Abstract: This paper investigates the characteristics of energy detection (ED) over
composite $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading channels in ultra machine-type
communication (mMTC) networks. We have derived the closed-form expressions of
the probability density function (PDF) of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on
the Inverse Gaussian (\emph{IG}) distribution. By adopting novel integration
and mathematical transformation techniques, we derive a truncation-based
closed-form expression for the average detection probability for the first
time. It can be observed from our simulations that the number of propagation
paths has a more pronounced effect on average detection probability compared to
average SNR, which is in contrast to earlier studies that focus on
device-to-device networks. It suggests that for 6G mMTC network design, we
should consider enhancing transmitter-receiver placement and antenna alignment
strategies, rather than relying solely on increasing the device-to-device
average SNR.

### [8] [On the Deployment of Multiple Radio Stripes for Large-Scale Near-Field RF Wireless Power Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21640)
*Amirhossein Azarbahram,Onel L. A. López,Petar Popovski,Matti Latva-aho*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了室内射频无线能量传输中无线电条带的部署问题，提出了基于聚类的两阶段优化方法，比较了四种部署算法效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对室内环境中能量需求集中的热点区域，优化无线电条带部署以最大化最小接收功率。

Method: 将问题分解为聚类和天线布局优化两阶段，提出四种部署算法（基于SCA/SGP及形状约束的直线/多边形）。

Result: 聚类方法收敛有效，多边形部署性能最优，直线部署在高增益下表现更好。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多种频率和条带长度下优于基准，形状约束方案各有优势。

Abstract: This paper investigates the deployment of radio stripe systems for indoor
radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) in line-of-sight near-field
scenarios. The focus is on environments where energy demand is concentrated in
specific areas, referred to as 'hotspots', spatial zones with higher user
density or consistent energy requirements. We formulate a joint clustering and
radio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received
power across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem
into two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on
their spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii)
antenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio
stripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex
approximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are
shape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either
straight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical
results show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with
Chebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The
optimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide
range of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped
deployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches. Meanwhile,
the line-shaped deployment demonstrates an advantage under high boresight gain
settings, benefiting from increased spatial diversity and broader angular
coverage.

### [9] [Machine Intelligence on the Edge: Interpretable Cardiac Pattern Localisation Using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21652)
*Haozhe Tian,Qiyu Rao,Nina Moutonnet,Pietro Ferraro,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种顺序匹配滤波器（SMF），通过强化学习设计滤波器序列，解决了传统匹配滤波器在低信噪比（SNR）信号中效果较差的问题，并应用于心电图（ECG）数据中的R峰检测和生理状态分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统匹配滤波器在低信噪比（SNR）信号（如边缘设备记录的信号）中效果不佳，因为这些信号中的噪声可能与目标信号非常相似。例如，耳心电图（ear-ECG）中的心脏信号会被衰减并受到严重干扰。

Method: 提出顺序匹配滤波器（SMF），将传统单匹配滤波器替换为由强化学习设计的滤波器序列，通过将滤波器设计建模为顺序决策过程，自适应地生成信号特定的滤波器序列。

Result: SMF在两个真实心电图数据集上实现了最先进的R峰检测和生理状态分类性能。

Conclusion: SMF框架在噪声信号中具有准确模式定位的潜力，适用于广泛的临床应用。

Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high
efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge
devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within
the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram
(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by
artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a
paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence
of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter
design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design
signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing
key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong
potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as
demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state
classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The
proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that
require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器学习的新型脑机接口（MI-BCI）流水线，能够高精度分类左右想象运动和静止状态，准确率达99.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于脑电图（EEG）数据解释的复杂性，该研究旨在开发一种更可靠的分类方法，以帮助恢复个体的行动自由。

Method: 采用机器学习技术，为52名受试者训练了针对个体的分类模型，并离线评估了性能。

Result: 所提出框架的分类准确率高达99.5%，优于现有的四种最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在MI-BCI系统中应用的潜力，具备高精度的分类性能。

Abstract: Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are systems that
detect and interpret brain activity patterns linked to the mental visualization
of movement, and then translate these into instructions for controlling
external robotic or domotic devices. Such devices have the potential to be
useful in a broad variety of applications. While implementing a system that
would help individuals restore some freedom levels, the interpretation of
(Electroencephalography) EEG data remains a complex and unsolved problem. In
the literature, the classification of left and right imagined movements has
been extensively studied. This study introduces a novel pipeline that makes use
of machine learning techniques for classifying MI EEG data. The entire
framework is capable of accurately categorizing left and imagined motions, as
well as rest phases, for a set of 52 subjects who performed a MI task. We
trained a within subject model on each individual subject. The methodology has
been offline evaluated and compared to four studies that are currently the
state-of-the-art regarding the specified dataset. The results show that our
proposed framework could be used with MI-BCI systems in light of its failsafe
classification performances, i.e. 99.5% in accuracy

TL;DR: 研究者提出了EO-Robotics（包括EO-1模型和EO-Data1.5M数据集），通过统一的架构和大规模高质量的多模态数据集，实现了在开放世界中的多模态推理与机器人控制的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在通用机器人控制上取得进展，但仍无法达到人类水平的灵活交互与推理能力，因此需要改进。

Method: 采用统一架构处理多模态输入（图像、文本、视频和动作），并基于大规模多模态数据集EO-Data1.5M（150万样本），结合自回归解码和流匹配去噪训练EO-1模型。

Result: 实验证明EO-1在开放世界理解和泛化能力上表现优异，可完成多种长视域和灵巧操作任务。

Conclusion: EO-1与EO-Data1.5M为开发高级具身基础模型提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for
developing advanced embodied foundation models.

Method: 采用级联观测器架构，结合光流和IMU数据，使用全局指数稳定的Riccati观测器进行融合，并通过梯度下降算法从稀疏光流数据中提取速度方向。

Result: 所提出的方法在持续激励平移运动条件下表现出几乎全局渐近稳定性，仿真验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该级联观测器架构能够有效地估计速度和重力方向，为单目VIO提供了一种稳定且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel cascaded observer architecture that combines
optical flow and IMU measurements to perform continuous monocular
visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed solution estimates body-frame
velocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction
information from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data.
This fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer,
which operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The
estimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an
optional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on
$\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation. The resulting interconnected observer
architecture is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable. To extract
the velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent
algorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit
sphere. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through
simulation results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最优运输理论和模型预测控制的多机器人路径规划与调度新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机器人在共享空间中导航时，传统方法可能导致路径重叠和死锁。

Result: 在最优情况下，计算复杂度为O(K^2 log K)，最坏情况下为O(K^3 log K)，并能处理不可避免的重叠轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、可靠，适用于复杂环境下的多机器人导航。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons show promise to assist human movement, but their
utility is limited by controllers designed for discrete, predefined actions in
controlled environments, restricting their real-world applicability. We present
an uncertainty-aware control framework that enables ankle exoskeletons to
operate safely across diverse scenarios by automatically disengaging when
encountering unfamiliar movements. Our approach uses an uncertainty estimator
to classify movements as similar (in-distribution) or different
(out-of-distribution) relative to actions in the training set. We evaluated
three architectures (model ensembles, autoencoders, and generative adversarial
networks) on an offline dataset and tested the strongest performing
architecture (ensemble of gait phase estimators) online. The online test
demonstrated the ability of our uncertainty estimator to turn assistance on and
off as the user transitioned between in-distribution and out-of-distribution
tasks (F1: 89.2). This new framework provides a path for exoskeletons to safely
and autonomously support human movement in unstructured, everyday environments.

*Tara Mina,Lindsey Marinello,John Christian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究重新探讨了延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器的有效性，证明其在不进行状态扩增的情况下，能达到与随机克隆相同的状态和协方差更新效果，同时具备计算和内存上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人学和导航中延迟状态测量的相关性问题，挑战随机克隆（SC）方法的普遍使用。

Method: 重新推导延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器，展示其无需状态扩增即可处理相关延迟测量，并分析其计算和内存效率。

Result: 延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器在状态和协方差更新上等同于SC方法，但更高效且节省内存。

Conclusion: 卡尔曼滤波器变体不仅能处理相关延迟状态测量，还能以更高效的方式实现相同结果，纠正了传统误解。

Abstract: Many estimation problems in robotics and navigation involve measurements that
depend on prior states. A prominent example is odometry, which measures the
relative change between states over time. Accurately handling these
delayed-state measurements requires capturing their correlations with prior
state estimates, and a widely used approach is stochastic cloning (SC), which
augments the state vector to account for these correlations.
  This work revisits a long-established but often overlooked alternative--the
delayed-state Kalman filter--and demonstrates that a properly derived filter
yields exactly the same state and covariance update as SC, without requiring
state augmentation. Moreover, the generalized Kalman filter formulation
provides computational advantages, while also reducing memory requirements for
higher-dimensional states.
  Our findings clarify a common misconception that Kalman filter variants are
inherently unable to handle correlated delayed-state measurements,
demonstrating that an alternative formulation achieves the same results more
efficiently.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive application of legal-action
masked Deep Q-Networks with safe ZYZ regrasp strategies to an underactuated
gripper-equipped 6-DOF collaborative robot for autonomous Soma cube assembly
learning. Our approach represents the first systematic integration of
constraint-aware reinforcement learning with singularity-safe motion planning
on a Doosan M0609 collaborative robot. We address critical challenges in
robotic manipulation: combinatorial action space explosion, unsafe motion
planning, and systematic assembly strategy learning. Our system integrates a
legal-action masked DQN with hierarchical architecture that decomposes
Q-function estimation into orientation and position components, reducing
computational complexity from $O(3,132)$ to $O(116) + O(27)$ while maintaining
solution completeness. The robot-friendly reward function encourages
ground-first, vertically accessible assembly sequences aligned with
manipulation constraints. Curriculum learning across three progressive
difficulty levels (2-piece, 3-piece, 7-piece) achieves remarkable training
efficiency: 100\% success rate for Level 1 within 500 episodes, 92.9\% for
Level 2, and 39.9\% for Level 3 over 105,300 total training episodes.

Result: 算法在模拟中表现出色，能长时间准确跟踪目标，性能接近最优分配。

Conclusion: 算法具有稳健性和实际适用性，适用于多目标跟踪任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of assigning heterogeneous sensors (i.e.,
robots with varying sensing capabilities) for multi-target tracking. We
classify robots into two categories: (1) sufficient sensing robots, equipped
with range and bearing sensors, capable of independently tracking targets, and
(2) limited sensing robots, which are equipped with only range or bearing
sensors and need to at least form a pair to collaboratively track a target. Our
objective is to optimize tracking quality by minimizing uncertainty in target
state estimation through efficient robot-to-target assignment. By leveraging
matroid theory, we propose a greedy assignment algorithm that dynamically
allocates robots to targets to maximize tracking quality. The algorithm
guarantees constant-factor approximation bounds of 1/3 for arbitrary tracking
quality functions and 1/2 for submodular functions, while maintaining
polynomial-time complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness in accurately estimating and tracking targets over extended
periods. Furthermore, numerical results confirm that the algorithm's
performance is close to that of the optimal assignment, highlighting its
robustness and practical applicability.

Motivation: 解决动态不确定环境中车辆协作的安全性和实时性挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架在安全性和实时性能上表现优越，具备强扩展性，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Achieving both safety guarantees and real-time performance in cooperative
vehicle coordination remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in dynamic
and uncertain environments. This paper presents a novel coordination framework
that resolves this challenge through three key innovations: 1) direct control
of vehicles' trajectory distributions during coordination, formulated as a
robust cooperative planning problem with adaptive enhanced safety constraints,
ensuring a specified level of safety regarding the uncertainty of the
interactive trajectory, 2) a fully parallel ADMM-based distributed trajectory
negotiation (ADMM-DTN) algorithm that efficiently solves the optimization
problem while allowing configurable negotiation rounds to balance solution
quality and computational resources, and 3) an interactive attention mechanism
that selectively focuses on critical interactive participants to further
enhance computational efficiency. Both simulation results and practical
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant advantages in
safety (reducing collision rates by up to 40.79\% in various scenarios) and
real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining
strong scalability with increasing vehicle numbers. The proposed interactive
attention mechanism further reduces the computational demand by 14.1\%. The
framework's effectiveness is further validated through real-world experiments
with unexpected dynamic obstacles, demonstrating robust coordination in complex
environments. The experiment demo could be found at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于自动驾驶车辆的新型运动规划和决策方法，采用多模态模型预测路径积分控制算法，通过Sobol序列采样并结合碰撞避免的解析解，显著提升了避障能力和车辆稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的运动规划方法可能陷入局部最优解，无法高效处理多模态场景（如避障或紧急停车），因此需要一种能同时探索多种轨迹并确保车辆稳定性的算法。

Method: 采用多模态模型预测路径积分控制算法，结合Sobol序列采样和碰撞避免解析解，使用非线性单轨车辆模型和Fiala轮胎模型，并在摩擦圆内约束轮胎力以确保稳定性。

Result: 高仿真环境下，算法在双车道变换、高低摩擦路面及移动障碍物场景中，表现出优于标准模型预测路径积分方法的避障和稳定性。

Conclusion: 多模态控制算法通过多样化轨迹探索和稳定性约束，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆的避障能力和安全性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to motion planning and decision-making
for automated vehicles, using a multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral
control algorithm. The method samples with Sobol sequences around the prior
input and incorporates analytical solutions for collision avoidance. By
leveraging multiple modes, the multi-modal control algorithm explores diverse
trajectories, such as manoeuvring around obstacles or stopping safely before
them, mitigating the risk of sub-optimal solutions. A non-linear single-track
vehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force
constraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability
during evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal
acceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to
control the vehicle. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the
vehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre on high and
low-friction road surfaces and occlusion scenarios with moving obstacles,
outperforming a standard Model Predictive Path Integral approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于去噪扩散模型的新型轨迹生成方法，能在保持关节和动态约束的前提下，充分利用机器人超出标称负载能力的实际潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器人标称负载保守估计导致工作空间利用率低下，忽视了机器人在大部分区域能够安全承载更高负载的能力。

Method: 采用去噪扩散模型，直接在规划过程中融入负载约束，生成动态可行的关节空间轨迹。

Result: 在7自由度Franka Emika Panda机器人上的实验表明，高达67.6%的工作空间在负载超过标称值3倍时仍可访问。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在运动规划算法中更细致地考虑负载动态有助于显著扩展机器人的操作范围。

Abstract: Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from
worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the
entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's
inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely
handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their
workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque
limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a
novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that
explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike
traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error,
optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners
that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically
feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly
executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation
on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the
workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal
capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a
more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在推理和代码生成方面表现出色，但在复杂的现实任务和多样用户指令下，生成可靠的策略代码仍具挑战性。

Method: 设计了RoboInspector流水线，从任务复杂性和指令粒度两个角度分析不可靠性，并通过实验验证了四种主要失败行为。

Result: 实验表明，基于失败策略代码反馈的改进方法可将策略代码生成的可靠性提升高达35%。

Conclusion: RoboInspector为减少LLM在机器人操控中的不可靠性提供了实用指导，并通过反馈机制显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

Result: 提供了一种区分合作与非合作人类的评估方法，并通过几何推理实现了更有效的人机沟通。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于几何分析和适时沟通的策略能显著提升机器人在社交导航中的表现。

Abstract: Socially aware robot navigation is a planning paradigm where the robot
navigates in human environments and tries to adhere to social constraints while
interacting with the humans in the scene. These navigation strategies were
further improved using human prediction models, where the robot takes the
potential future trajectory of humans while computing its own. Though these
strategies significantly improve the robot's behavior, it faces difficulties
from time to time when the human behaves in an unexpected manner. This happens
as the robot fails to understand human intentions and cooperativeness, and the
human does not have a clear idea of what the robot is planning to do. In this
paper, we aim to address this gap through effective communication at an
appropriate time based on a geometric analysis of the context and human
cooperativeness in head-on crossing scenarios. We provide an assessment
methodology and propose some evaluation metrics that could distinguish a
cooperative human from a non-cooperative one. Further, we also show how
geometric reasoning can be used to generate appropriate verbal responses or
robot actions.

Abstract: Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors
with minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on
short-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve
long-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution
shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns
continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill
demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph,
discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains
low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level
oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal
observation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables
capturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal
relations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to
discover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six
domains that involve four robotic arms, Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers
of Hanoi environments, and a distinct Automated Forklift domain with two
environments. The results demonstrate high data efficiency with as few as five
skill demonstrations, strong zero- and few-shot generalizations, and
interpretable decision making.

Abstract: Path planning in robotics often involves solving continuously valued,
high-dimensional problems. Popular informed approaches include graph-based
searches, such as A*, and sampling-based methods, such as Informed RRT*, which
utilize informed set and anytime strategies to expedite path optimization
incrementally. Informed sampling-based planners define informed sets as subsets
of the problem domain based on the current best solution cost. However, when no
solution is found, these planners re-sample and explore the entire
configuration space, which is time-consuming and computationally expensive.
This article introduces Multi-Informed Trees (MIT*), a novel planner that
constructs estimated informed sets based on prior admissible solution costs
before finding the initial solution, thereby accelerating the initial
convergence rate. Moreover, MIT* employs an adaptive sampler that dynamically
adjusts the sampling strategy based on the exploration process. Furthermore,
MIT* utilizes length-related adaptive sparse collision checks to guide lazy
reverse search. These features enhance path cost efficiency and computation
times while ensuring high success rates in confined scenarios. Through a series
of simulations and real-world experiments, it is confirmed that MIT*
outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners for problems in R^4
to R^16 and has been successfully applied to real-world robot manipulation
tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at:

Abstract: Traversing narrow gates presents a significant challenge and has become a
standard benchmark for evaluating agile and precise quadrotor flight.
Traditional modularized autonomous flight stacks require extensive design and
parameter tuning, while end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) methods often
suffer from low sample efficiency and limited interpretability. In this work,
we present a novel hybrid framework that adaptively fine-tunes model predictive
control (MPC) parameters online using outputs from a neural network (NN)
trained offline. The NN jointly predicts a reference pose and cost-function
weights, conditioned on the coordinates of the gate corners and the current
drone state. To achieve efficient training, we derive analytical policy
gradients not only for the MPC module but also for an optimization-based gate
traversal detection module. Furthermore, we introduce a new formulation of the
attitude tracking error that admits a simplified representation, facilitating
effective learning with bounded gradients. Hardware experiments demonstrate
that our method enables fast and accurate quadrotor traversal through narrow
gates in confined environments. It achieves several orders of magnitude
improvement in sample efficiency compared to naive end-to-end RL approaches.

Abstract: Industrial manipulators are normally operated in cluttered environments,
making safe motion planning important. Furthermore, the presence of
model-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in
practice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances.
There is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be
executed fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive
control (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a
robust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free
motion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making
our method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a
simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered
environments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark
methods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model
uncertainties, while also yielding faster motion.

Conclusion: 该方法具有潜力，值得进一步探索，为机器人行为设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pedestrians approaching each other on a sidewalk sometimes end up in an
awkward interaction known as the "sidewalk salsa": they both (repeatedly)
deviate to the same side to avoid a collision. This provides an interesting use
case to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in
the vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation
based on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how
pedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into
the implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and
acceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,
a model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction
(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,
it is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and
decision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used
framework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept
for an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model
to learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL
agent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a
risk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用数据流学习技术检测肌电信号中的领域漂移，揭示了当前方法在实时检测中的局限性，并指出了未来研究的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌电信号的非平稳性导致检测领域漂移具有挑战性，研究旨在探索有效的实时检测方法。

Method: 使用基于KPCA的数据预处理，并结合CUSUM、Page-Hinckley和ADWIN等漂移检测方法进行评估。

Result: 当前技术在肌电信号实时领域漂移检测中性能有限，但数据流方法显示了潜力。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要进一步优化方法以提高实际应用中的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: GENNAV提出了一种新方法，用于从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域的位置，特别针对模糊边界的stuff-type目标区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域时性能不佳，且难以应对目标缺失或多目标的情况。

Method: GENNAV预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。

Result: 在GRiN-Drive基准测试和真实世界实验中，GENNAV表现优于基线方法，展现了跨环境的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV在目标区域识别任务中表现优异，适用于多样化的真实世界环境。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

*Ziwei Liao,Mohamed Sayed,Steven L. Waslander,Sara Vicente,Daniyar Turmukhambetov,Michael Firman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的方法，通过单张图像重建完整的3D场景，解决了传统方法在遮挡区域重建中的模糊性和单一性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Gaussian splatting方法需要密集观测且无法重建遮挡或未观测区域，限制了其在单张图像输入场景中的应用。

Method: 论文采用生成式方法，通过变分自编码器和潜在扩散模型，学习基于单张输入图像的3D高斯分布表示。

Result: 该方法能够生成高质量360度渲染，并重建遮挡区域，同时支持多样化的生成结果。

Conclusion: 通过生成式方法，能够有效地解决单视图3D重建中的遮挡区域问题，提供更加真实和多样化的结果。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 研究探讨了自监督学习模型（如Wav2Vec2、HuBERT等）在不同层级特征提取中的效果，用于提升儿童语音识别的准确率。结果显示Wav2Vec2的22层在零样本场景下表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语音因其独特的声学和语言特征，导致自动语音识别（ASR）系统难以准确处理。虽然自监督学习模型在成人语音上表现优异，但儿童语音仍具挑战性。

Method: 研究了Wav2Vec2、HuBERT等模型的层级特征，简化了DNN-ASR系统，并在Kaldi工具包中测试。使用WSJCAM0成人语音训练，PFSTAR儿童语音测试。

Result: Wav2Vec2的22层WER最低（5.15%），比直接零样本解码提升51.64%。年龄组分析显示性能随年龄增长而一致提升。

Conclusion: 自监督学习模型的特征提取能显著提升儿童语音识别的性能，且在跨数据集（CMU Kids）中也表现出通用性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately
process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and
linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech,
accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This
study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from
state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT,
Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech
in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these
models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system
using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for
enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where
WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for
testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model
achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64%
relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of
10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent
performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains
observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments
on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the
generalizability of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 儿童语音的独特声学和语言特征给关键词检测系统带来挑战，传统方法难以应对。

Method: 使用Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和Data2Vec等自监督学习模型提取特征，训练Kaldi-based DNN KWS系统。

Result: 在儿童语音数据集上取得了最优结果，Wav2Vec2的第22层表现最佳，噪声条件下也显著优于传统MFCC方法。

Conclusion: 自监督学习特征显著提升了儿童语音的零样本关键词检测性能，解决了儿童语音特有的挑战。

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in
adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems
due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper
introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art
self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec.
Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a
Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for
training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing,
demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved
state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech.
Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best,
delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of
false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a
set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed
the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess
the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted
using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The
results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based
baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions.
To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an
additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant
contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for
children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the
distinct characteristics of child speakers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA*虽利用多个不可采纳启发式函数加速搜索，但无法持续改进解，需精心调整参数。

Method: 借鉴ARA*算法，将MHA*扩展为Anytime版本（A-MHA*），保留原MHA*的次优性和完整性。

Result: 在3D路径规划和滑动拼图任务中，A-MHA*表现优于MHA*和其他Anytime算法。

Conclusion: A-MHA*成功继承MHA*优势并实现持续优化，适用于需快速初始解和逐步优化的场景。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于预训练扩散模型的规划在非凸、不可微或多奖励场景中的局限性，以及现有方法在任务特定训练和零样本泛化上的不足。

Method: TDP采用树搜索和双层采样：1）训练无关的粒子引导生成多样轨迹探索；2）任务目标引导的快速条件去噪细化子轨迹。

Result: 在迷宫拾金、机械臂操作和AntMaze多目标探索任务中，TDP均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过结构化轨迹生成和梯度信息利用，提升了零样本规划的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

Abstract: We consider the following inference problem: Given a set of edge-flow signals
observed on a graph, lift the graph to a cell complex, such that the observed
edge-flow signals can be represented as a sparse combination of gradient and
curl flows on the cell complex. Specifically, we aim to augment the observed
graph by a set of 2-cells (polygons encircled by closed, non-intersecting
paths), such that the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian of the associated
cell complex provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed
edge flows on the graph. As it has been shown that the general problem is
NP-hard in prior work, we here develop a novel matrix-factorization-based
heuristic to solve the problem. Using computational experiments, we demonstrate
that our new approach is significantly less computationally expensive than
prior heuristics, while achieving only marginally worse performance in most
settings. In fact, we find that for specifically noisy settings, our new
approach outperforms the previous state of the art in both solution quality and
computational speed.

Abstract: The high mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables them to be used
in various civilian fields, such as rescue and cargo transport. Path-following
is a crucial way to perform these tasks while sensing and collision avoidance
are essential for safe flight. In this paper, we investigate how to efficiently
and accurately achieve path-following, obstacle sensing and avoidance subtasks,
as well as their conflict-free fusion scheduling. Firstly, a high precision
deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV formation path-following model is
developed, and the reward function with adaptive weights is designed from the
perspective of distance and velocity errors. Then, we use integrated sensing
and communication (ISAC) signals to detect the obstacle and derive the
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for obstacle sensing by information-level fusion,
based on which we propose the variable formation enhanced obstacle position
estimation (VFEO) algorithm. In addition, an online obstacle avoidance scheme
without pretraining is designed to solve the sparse reward. Finally, with the
aid of null space based (NSB) behavioral method, we present a hierarchical
subtasks fusion strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of the subtask algorithms and the hierarchical fusion strategy.
