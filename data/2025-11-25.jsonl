Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced. These results suggest that reconstructing what the brain perceives, rather than what it classifies, is key to faithful EEG-based image generation."}

To address these challenges, the propagation environment semantics-aware wireless environment knowledge beam prediction (PES-WEKBP) framework is proposed. PES-WEKBP pioneers a novel electromagnetic (EM)-grounded knowledge distillation method, transforming raw visual data into an ultra-lean, interpretable material and location-related wireless environment knowledge matrix. This matrix explicitly encodes critical propagation environment semantics, which is material EM properties and spatial relationships through a physics-informed parameterization process, distilling the environment and channel interplay into a minimal yet information-dense representation. A lightweight decision network then leverages this highly compressed knowledge for low-complexity beam prediction. To holistically evaluate the performance of PES-WEKBP, we first design the prediction consistency-efficiency index (PCEI), which combines prediction accuracy with a stability-penalized logarithmic training time to ensure a balanced optimization of reliability and computational efficiency. Experiments validate that PES-WEKBP achieves a 99.75% to 99.96% dimension reduction and improves accuracy by 5.52% to 8.19%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PCEI scores across diverse vehicular scenarios."}

Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency. Experimental results on the publicly available SEVIR dataset demonstrate that WaveC2R achieves state-of-the-art performance in satellite-based radar retrieval, particularly excelling at preserving high-intensity precipitation features and sharply defined meteorological boundaries."}

Signal Process", "summary": "Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is well-suited for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), yet its cyclic prefix (CP) is dimensioned for communications-grade multipath and is generally insufficient for sensing. When echoes exceed the CP duration, inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISI/ICI) break subcarrier orthogonality and degrade sensing. This paper presents a unified analytical and algorithmic framework for OFDM-ISAC beyond the CP limit. We first develop a general echo model that explicitly captures the structured coupling of ISI and ICI caused by CP insufficiency. Building on this model, we derive closed-form expressions for the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the range-Doppler peak sidelobe level ratio (PSLR), both of which are shown to deteriorate approximately linearly with the normalized excess delay beyond the CP. To mitigate these effects, we propose two standard-compatible successive interference cancellation (SIC) methods: SIC-DFT, a low-complexity DFT-based scheme, and SIC-ESPRIT, a super-resolution subspace approach. Simulations corroborate the analysis and demonstrate consistent gains over representative benchmarks. Both algorithms provide more than $4$dB SINR improvement under CP-insufficient conditions, while SIC-ESPRIT reduces range/velocity root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) by about one order of magnitude, approaching the performance achievable with a sufficiently long CP. These results offer both theoretical insight and practical solutions for reliable long-range OFDM-ISAC sensing beyond the CP limit."}

AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform (AUTOSAR AP) is widely adopted in development to meet these criteria; however, licensing constraints and tool implementation challenges limit its use in research. Conversely, Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is predominantly used in research within the autonomous driving domain, leading to a disparity between research and development platforms that hinders swift commercialization. This paper proposes a collaboration framework that enables AUTOSAR AP and ROS 2 to communicate with each other using a Data Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems (DDS). In contrast, AUTOSAR AP uses Scalable service-Oriented Middleware over IP (SOME/IP) for communication. The proposed framework bridges these protocol differences, ensuring seamless interaction between the two platforms. We validate the functionality and performance of our bridge converter through empirical analysis, demonstrating its efficiency in conversion time and ease of integration with ROS 2 tools. Furthermore, the availability of the proposed collaboration framework is improved by automatically generating a configuration file for the proposed bridge converter."}

A repeater is an active scatterer that retransmits incoming signals with a complex gain almost instantaneously, thereby enhancing sensing performance by amplifying the echoes reflected by the targets. The same mechanism can also improve downlink communication by mitigating coverage holes. However, the repeater introduces noise and increases interference at the sensing receiver, while also amplifying the interference from target detection signals at the downlink users. The proposed framework accounts for these sensing-communication trade-offs and demonstrates the potential benefits achievable through a carefully designed precoder at the transmitting base station. In particular, our finding is that a higher value of probability of detection can be attained with considerably lower target radar-cross-section variance by deploying repeaters in the target hot-spot areas."}

Using sinusoidally activated neural networks to represent layers and toolpaths as implicit fields, our method enables direct evaluation of field values and derivatives at any spatial point, thereby allowing explicit collision avoidance and joint optimization of manufacturing layers and toolpaths. We further investigate how network hyperparameters and objective definitions influence singularity behavior and topology transitions, offering built-in mechanisms for regularization and stability control. The proposed approach is demonstrated on examples in both additive and subtractive manufacturing, validating its generality and effectiveness."}

Our key idea lies in spreading data symbols across the delay-Doppler (DD) domain through orthogonal chirp-Zak transform (CZT). To enable efficient signal multiplexing, the proposed modulation scheme employs a transmitter signal that maintains orthogonality with the inherent resolution characteristics of the DD plane. Termed as Orthogonal Chirp Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (CDDM), we demonstrate a synergistic integration of chirp waveform properties with the channel structure of the DD domain, thereby achieving advantages with both lower computational efficiency and improved detection performance. We introduce a novel CZT-based superimposed sparse pilot structure to enable simultaneous estimation of delay-Doppler shifts and channel coefficients. For enhanced performance, we further develop an embedded pilot scheme that demonstrates channel estimation performance comparable to that of Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ODDM) systems. Simulation results demonstrate that CDDM achieves significant bit error rate (BER) improvements over existing modulation schemes , under perfect channel state information (CSI), as well as superior out-of-band emissions (OOBE). Further, for the imperfect CSI case, the proposed CZT-based superimposed pilot scheme leads to significantly reduced normalized mean square error (NMSE), whilst attaining equivalent estimation accuracy to that of ODDM with lower computational complexity."}

The effectiveness of the developed three-stage strategy stems from the careful design of both the pilot signal sequence of the users and the vectors of RIS. Specifically, in Stage I, the cascaded channel components are eliminated by configuring the RIS phase shift vectors with a π difference to estimate the direct channels for all users. The orthogonal subspace projection is employed in Stage II to obtain equivalent signal matrices, enabling the estimation of angles of departure (AoDs) of the user-RIS channel for all users. In Stage III, we combine the signals of the time slots with the same pilots and project obtained measurement matrix to the orthogonal complement space of the component consisting of the portion of the direct channel, which removes the direct components and thus prevents error propagation from the direct channels to the cascaded channels. Then, we estimate the angles of arrival (AoAs) of the RIS-BS channel and remaining parameters of the cascaded channel for all users by exploiting the sparsity and correlation in the obtained equivalent matrices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method yields better estimation performance than the existing methods."}

We extend classical optical flow formulations by integrating them with depth modeling strategies tailored to the geometry for lunar/planetary approach, descent, and landing, specifically, planar and spherical terrain approximations parameterized by a laser rangefinder. Motion field inversion is performed through a least-squares framework, using sparse optical flow features extracted via the pyramidal Lucas-Kanade algorithm. We verify our approach using synthetically generated lunar images over the challenging terrain of the lunar south pole, using CPU budgets compatible with small lunar landers. The results demonstrate accurate velocity estimation from approach to landing, with sub-10% error for complex terrain and on the order of 1% for more typical terrain, as well as performances suitable for real-time applications.

In addition, learnable historical sidelobe information is introduced to enhance the robustness and environmental adaptability of the detection process. Furthermore, based on multichannel echo data, a target reconstruction model that combines the Candan algorithm with least-squares estimation is established, incorporating the CLEAN concept to suppress sidelobe interference. Monte Carlo simulations and real-world measurement experiments demonstrate that the proposed CT-CFAR algorithm achieves high-precision target detection without requiring prior knowledge of abnormal samples.

While recent optimization-based methods such as Hierarchical Task Model Predictive Control (HTMPC) enable efficient multitask execution with strict task priorities, they have so far been applied mainly to static or structured scenarios. Extending these approaches to dynamic human-centered environments requires predictive models that capture how humans react to the actions of the robot. This work introduces Safe Mobile Manipulation with Interactive Human Prediction via Task-Hierarchical Bilevel Model Predictive Control (SM$^2$ITH), a unified framework that combines HTMPC with interactive human motion prediction through bilevel optimization that jointly accounts for robot and human dynamics. The framework is validated on two different mobile manipulators, the Stretch 3 and the Ridgeback-UR10, across three experimental settings: (i) delivery tasks with different navigation and manipulation priorities, (ii) sequential pick-and-place tasks with different human motion prediction models, and (iii) interactions involving adversarial human behavior. Our results highlight how interactive prediction enables safe and efficient coordination, outperforming baselines that rely on weighted objectives or open-loop human models."}

Concurrently, several works have demonstrated that simple learning objectives, such as L1 regression, can achieve performance comparable to denoising-based methods on certain tasks, while offering faster convergence and inference. In this paper, we focus on how to combine the advantages of these two paradigms: retaining the ability of denoising models to capture multi-modal distributions and avoid mode collapse while achieving the efficiency of the L1 regression objective. To achieve this vision, we reformulate the original v-prediction flow matching and transform it into sample-prediction with the L1 training objective. We empirically show that the multi-modality can be expressed via a single ODE step. Thus, we propose \\textbf{L1 Flow}, a two-step sampling schedule that generates a suboptimal action sequence via a single integration step and then reconstructs the precise action sequence through a single prediction. The proposed method largely retains the advantages of flow matching while reducing the iterative neural function evaluations to merely two and mitigating the potential performance degradation associated with direct sample regression.

In addition, most existing CSI acquisition methods fail to leverage the spatio-temporal sparsity inherent in the channel, resulting in suboptimal estimation performance. To address these challenges, we consider an XL-IRS-aided wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system and propose an efficient channel estimation and tracking (CET) algorithm. Specifically, a unified near-field cascaded channel representation model is presented first, and a hierarchical spatio-temporal sparse prior is then constructed to capture two-dimensional (2D) block sparsity in the polar domain, one-dimensional (1D) clustered sparsity in the angle-delay domain, and temporal correlations across different channel estimation frames. Based on these priors, a tensor-based sparse CET (TS-CET) algorithm is proposed that integrates tensor-based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) with particle-based variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and message passing. Simulation results demonstrate that the TS-CET framework significantly improves the estimation accuracy and reduces the pilot overhead as compared to existing benchmark methods."}

Using the learned statistics, Robust-NTC also facilitates rate-distortion optimization to adaptively select element-wise quantizers and bit depths according to online channel condition. To support practical deployment, Robust-NTC is integrated into an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where a unified resource allocation framework jointly optimizes latent quantization, bit allocation, modulation order, and power allocation to minimize transmission latency while guaranteeing learned distortion targets.

While existing studies primarily attribute the inconsistency to observability mismatch, these analyses are often based on simplified theoretical formulations that consider only prediction and SLAM correction. Such formulations fail to cover the non-standard estimation steps, such as MSCKF correction and delayed initialization, which are critical for practical VINS estimators. Furthermore, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of how inconsistency dynamically emerges across estimation steps has hindered the development of precise and efficient solutions. As a result, current approaches often face a trade-off between estimator accuracy, consistency, and implementation complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel analysis framework termed Unobservable Subspace Evolution (USE), which systematically characterizes how the unobservable subspace evolves throughout the entire estimation pipeline by explicitly tracking changes in its evaluation points. This perspective sheds new light on how individual estimation steps contribute to inconsistency. Our analysis reveals that observability misalignment induced by certain steps is the antecedent of observability mismatch. Guided by this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution paradigm, Unobservable Subspace Alignment (USA), which eliminates inconsistency by selectively intervening only in those estimation steps that induce misalignment. We design two USA methods: transformation-based and re-evaluation-based, both offering accurate and computationally lightweight solutions. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."}

In this paper, we propose a novel wireless sensing system based on MA arrays to enhance multi-target spatial angle estimation performance. We begin by characterizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for multi-target angle of arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the antenna's positions in MA arrays, thereby establishing a theoretical foundation for antenna position optimization. Then, aiming at improving the sensing coverage performance, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the expectation of the trace of the CRB matrix over random target angles subject to a given distribution by optimizing the antennas' positions. To tackle the formulated challenging optimization problem, the Monte Carlo method is employed to approximate the intractable objective function, and a swarm-based gradient descent algorithm is subsequently proposed to address the approximated problem. In addition, a lower-bound on the sum of CRBs for multi-target AoA estimation is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-based design achieves superior sensing performance compared to conventional systems using fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays and single-target-oriented MA arrays, in terms of decreasing both CRB and the actual AoA estimation mean square error (MSE). Fundamentally, the designed MA array geometry exhibits low correlation and high effective power of sensitivity vectors for multi-target sensing in the angular domain, leading to significant CRB performance improvement. The resultant low correlation of steering vectors over multiple targets' directions further helps mitigate angle estimation ambiguity and thus enhances MSE performance."}

However, conventional MA implementations often adopt fully digital beamforming (FDB), which requires a dedicated RF chain for each antenna. This requirement significantly increase hardware costs, making such systems impractical for multi-antenna deployments. To address this, hardware-efficient analog beamforming (AB) offers a cost-effective alternative. This paper investigates the physical layer security (PLS) in an MA-enabled multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system with an emphasis on AB. In this scenario, an MA-enabled transmitter with AB broadcasts common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, while a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our objective is to maximize the multicast secrecy rate (MSR) by jointly optimizing the phase shifts of the AB and the positions of the MAs, subject to constraints on the movement area of the MAs and the constant modulus (CM) property of the analog phase shifters. This MSR maximization problem is highly challenging, as we have formally proven it to be NP-hard. To solve it efficiently, we propose a penalty constrained product manifold (PCPM) framework. Specifically, we first reformulate the position constraints as a penalty function, enabling unconstrained optimization on a product manifold space (PMS), and then propose a parallel conjugate gradient descent algorithm to efficiently update the variables. Simulation results demonstrate that MA-enabled systems with AB can achieve a well-balanced performance in terms of MSR and hardware costs."}

The global planner offers distribution-free safety guarantees for long-horizon navigation, while the local planner mitigates inaccuracies in obstacle trajectory predictions through adaptive CP, enabling robust and responsive motion in dynamic environments. To further enhance trajectory feasibility, we introduce an adaptive quantile mechanism in the CP-based uncertainty quantification. Instead of using a fixed confidence level, the quantile is automatically tuned to the optimal value that preserves trajectory feasibility, allowing the planner to adaptively tighten safety margins in regions with higher uncertainty.

Conventional approaches typically rely on sampling-based planners such as MPPI to generate short-term control actions that aim to minimize traversal time and risk measures derived from the traversability estimates.

Moreover, they lack the ability to adjust speed based on the terrain bumpiness, which is important for smooth navigation on challenging terrains. In this paper, we introduce TRAIL (Traversability with an Implicit Learned Representation), an off-road navigation framework that leverages an implicit neural representation to continuously parameterize terrain properties. This representation yields spatial gradients that enable integration with a novel gradient-based trajectory optimization method that adapts the path geometry and speed profile based on terrain traversability."}

A promising direction is learning high-level, symbolic abstractions of the low-level skills of the agents, enabling reasoning and planning independent of the low-level state space. Among possible high-level representations, object-centric skill abstraction with symbolic predicates has been proven to be efficient because of its compatibility with domain-independent planners. Recent advances in foundation models have made it possible to generate symbolic predicates that operate on raw sensory inputs, a process we call generative predicate invention, to facilitate downstream abstraction learning. However, it remains unclear which formal properties the learned representations must satisfy, and how they can be learned to guarantee these properties. In this paper, we address both questions by presenting a formal theory of generative predicate invention for skill abstraction, resulting in symbolic operators that can be used for provably sound and complete planning. Within this framework, we propose SkillWrapper, a method that leverages foundation models to actively collect robot data and learn human-interpretable, plannable representations of black-box skills, using only RGB image observations. Our extensive empirical evaluation in simulation and on real robots shows that SkillWrapper learns abstract representations that enable solving unseen, long-horizon tasks in the real world with black-box skills."}

On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI."}

In this work, we propose a vision-based, markerless, and training-free framework for soft robot shape reconstruction that directly leverages the robot's natural surface appearance. These surface features act as implicit visual markers, enabling a hierarchical matching strategy that decouples local partition alignment from global kinematic optimization. Requiring only an initial 3D reconstruction and kinematic alignment, our method achieves real-time shape tracking across diverse environments while maintaining robustness to occlusions and variations in camera viewpoints. Experimental validation on a continuum soft robot demonstrates an average tip error of 2.6% during real-time operation, as well as stable performance in practical closed-loop control tasks.

This challenge is particularly acute in domains like mission planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which demand solutions on large-scale terrain graphs. This paper introduces APULSE, a hybrid label-setting algorithm designed to efficiently solve the RCSPP on such challenging graphs.

The framework is applied to airborne SnowSAR measurements over Grand Mesa, Colorado, and evaluated against snow pit SWE and LiDAR snow depth from the SnowEx'17 campaign. Prior distributions of snowpack properties are generated with MSHM forced by numerical weather prediction, and vegetation and soil parameters are initialized from Ku HH observations under frozen conditions and interpolated from open to nearby forested areas using kriging. Successful SWE and snow depth retrievals in forested pixels are obtained where relative backscatter residuals are below 30% for incidence angles between 30 and 50 degrees, capturing both the mean and variance of snowpack distributions. For 90 m forested pixels, the snow depth RMSE is 0.033 m (less than 8% of maximum pit SWE), with improved spatial patterns relative to hydrology only simulations. Performance degrades in highly heterogeneous land cover such as mixed forest and wetlands and along canopy and water boundaries due to uncertainty in canopy closure, although absolute snow depth differences remain below 10% and 20% for about 62% and 82% of pixels, respectively.

Tactile signals can address this gap, but existing sensors often require expensive, delicate, or integration-heavy hardware. In this work, we introduce MicCheck, a plug-and-play acoustic sensing approach that repurposes an off-the-shelf Bluetooth pin microphone as a low-cost contact sensor. The microphone clips into a 3D-printed gripper insert and streams audio via a standard USB receiver, requiring no custom electronics or drivers. Despite its simplicity, the microphone provides signals informative enough for both perception and control. In material classification, it achieves 92.9% accuracy on a 10-class benchmark across four interaction types (tap, knock, slow press, drag). For manipulation, integrating pin microphone into an IL pipeline with open source hardware improves the success rate on picking and pouring task from 0.40 to 0.80 and enables reliable execution of contact-rich skills such as unplugging and sound-based sorting. Compared with high-resolution tactile sensors, pin microphones trade spatial detail for cost and ease of integration, offering a practical pathway for deploying acoustic contact sensing in low-cost robot setups."}

Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes.

A challenge in magnetically manipulating surgical tools is that the effective workspace of an eMNS is often severely constrained by power and thermal limits. We show that system-level control design significantly expands this workspace by reducing the currents needed to achieve a desired motion. We identified five key system approaches that enable this expansion: (i) motion-centric torque/force objectives, (ii) energy-optimal current allocation, (iii) real-time pose estimation, (iv) dynamic feedback, and (v) high-bandwidth eMNS components. As a result, we stabilize a 3D inverted pendulum on an eight-coil OctoMag eMNS with significantly lower currents (0.1-0.2 A vs. 8-14 A), by replacing a field-centric field-alignment strategy with a motion-centric torque/force-based approach. We generalize to multi-agent control by simultaneously stabilizing two inverted pendulums within a shared workspace, exploiting magnetic-field nonlinearity and coil redundancy for independent actuation. A structured analysis compares the electromagnetic workspaces of both paradigms and examines current-allocation strategies that map motion objectives to coil currents. Cross-platform evaluation of the clinically oriented Navion eMNS further demonstrates substantial workspace expansion by maintaining stable balancing at distances up to 50 cm from the coils. The results demonstrate that feedback is a practical path to scalable, efficient, and clinically relevant magnetic manipulation."}

SafeFall is designed to operate seamlessly alongside existing nominal controller, ensuring no interference during normal operation. It combines two synergistic components: a lightweight, GRU-based fall predictor that continuously monitors the robot's state, and a reinforcement learning policy for damage mitigation. The protective policy remains dormant until the predictor identifies a fall as unavoidable, at which point it activates to take control and execute a damage-minimizing response. This policy is trained with a novel, damage-aware reward function that incorporates the robot's specific structural vulnerabilities, learning to shield critical components like the head and hands while absorbing energy with more robust parts of its body. Validated on a full-scale Unitree G1 humanoid, SafeFall demonstrated significant performance improvements over unprotected falls. It reduced peak contact forces by 68.3\\%, peak joint torques by 78.4\\%, and eliminated 99.3\\% of collisions with vulnerable components.

To address this, we introduce an approach using Diffused Orientation Fields (DOF), a smooth representation of local reference frames, for transfer learning of tasks across curved objects. By expressing manipulation tasks in these smoothly varying local frames, we reduce the problem of transferring tasks across curved objects to establishing sparse keypoint correspondences. DOF is computed online from raw point cloud data using diffusion processes governed by partial differential equations, conditioned on keypoints. We evaluate DOF under geometric, topological, and localization perturbations, and demonstrate successful transfer of tasks requiring continuous physical interaction such as inspection, slicing, and peeling across varied objects.

However, existing methods implement \"least-restrictive\" filtering that discretely switch between nominal and safety policies, potentially undermining the task performance that makes modern visuomotor policies valuable. While reachability value functions can, in principle, be adapted to be control barrier functions (CBFs) for smooth optimization-based filtering, we theoretically and empirically show that current latent-space learning methods produce fundamentally incompatible value functions. We identify two sources of incompatibility: First, in HJ reachability, failures are encoded via a \"margin function\" in latent space, whose sign indicates whether or not a latent is in the constraint set. However, representing the margin function as a classifier yields saturated value functions that exhibit discontinuous jumps. We prove that the value function's Lipschitz constant scales linearly with the margin function's Lipschitz constant, revealing that smooth CBFs require smooth margins. Second, reinforcement learning (RL) approximations trained solely on safety policy data yield inaccurate value estimates for nominal policy actions, precisely where CBF filtering needs them. We propose the LatentCBF, which addresses both challenges through gradient penalties that lead to smooth margin functions without additional labeling, and a value-training procedure that mixes data from both nominal and safety policy distributions. Experiments on simulated benchmarks and hardware with a vision-based manipulation policy demonstrate that LatentCBF enables smooth safety filtering while doubling the task-completion rate over prior switching methods."}

There has been increasing demand to perform this process at the boarding gate to minimise the downtime of the aircraft and automating this process is desired to reduce the reliance on human labour. Automating this typically requires estimating a camera's pose with respect to the aircraft for initialisation but most existing localisation methods require infrastructure, which is very challenging in uncontrolled outdoor environments and within the limited turnover time (approximately 2 hours) on an airport tarmac. Additionally, many airlines and airports do not allow contact with the aircraft's surface or using UAVs for inspection between flights, and restrict access to commercial aircraft. Hence, this paper proposes an on-site method that is infrastructure-free and easy to deploy for estimating a pan-tilt-zoom camera's pose and localising scan images. This method initialises using the same pan-tilt-zoom camera used for the inspection task by utilising a Deep Convolutional Neural Network fine-tuned on only synthetic images to predict its own pose. We apply domain randomisation to generate the dataset for fine-tuning the network and modify its loss function by leveraging aircraft geometry to improve accuracy. We also propose a workflow for initialisation, scan path planning, and precise localisation of images captured from a pan-tilt-zoom camera.

To address this, we introduce a Delay-Aware ADMM (DA-ADMM) variant that adapts penalty parameters based on real-time delay statistics, allowing agents to down-weight stale information and prioritize recent updates during consensus and dual updates. Through extensive simulations in 2D and 3D environments with double-integrator, Dubins-car, and drone dynamics, we show that DA-ADMM significantly improves robustness, success rate, and solution quality compared to fixed-parameter, residual-balancing, and fixed-constraint baselines. Our results highlight that performance degradation is not solely determined by delay length or frequency, but by the optimizer's ability to contextually reason over delayed information.

First, the newly observed areas are denoised to avoid low-efficiency GVD nodes misleading the topological structure. Subsequently, a multi-granularity hierarchical GVD generation method is designed to control the sampling granularity at both global and local levels. This not only ensures the accuracy of the topological structure but also enhances the ability to capture detail features, reduces the probability of path backtracking, and ensures no overlap between GVDs through the maintenance of a coverage map, thereby improving GVD utilization efficiency. Second, a node clustering method with connectivity constraints and a connectivity method based on a switching mechanism are designed to avoid the generation of unreachable nodes and erroneous nodes caused by obstacle attraction. A special cache structure is used to store all connectivity information, thereby improving exploration efficiency. Finally, to address the issue of frontiers misjudgment caused by obstacles within the scope of GVD units, a frontiers extraction method based on morphological dilation is designed to effectively ensure the reachability of frontiers. On this basis, a lightweight cost function is used to assess and switch to the next viewpoint in real time.

Leveraging these force estimates, we implemented an admittance control algorithm to enhance terrain adaptability. Simulation experiments validated the real-time performance of the force estimator and the robot's robustness when traversing uneven terrain."}

While they perform well when fine-tuned for a single embodiment or task family, extending them to multi-skill settings remains challenging: directly merging VLA experts trained on different tasks results in near-zero success rates. This raises a fundamental question: what prevents VLAs from mastering multiple skills within one model? With an empirical decomposition of learnable parameters during VLA fine-tuning, we identify two key sources of non-mergeability: (1) Finetuning drives LoRA adapters in the VLM backbone toward divergent, task-specific directions beyond the capacity of existing merging methods to unify. (2) Action experts develop inter-block dependencies through self-attention feedback, causing task information to spread across layers and preventing modular recombination. To address these challenges, we present MergeVLA, a merging-oriented VLA architecture that preserves mergeability by design. MergeVLA introduces sparsely activated LoRA adapters via task masks to retain consistent parameters and reduce irreconcilable conflicts in the VLM. Its action expert replaces self-attention with cross-attention-only blocks to keep specialization localized and composable. When the task is unknown, it uses a test-time task router to adaptively select the appropriate task mask and expert head from the initial observation, enabling unsupervised task inference. Across LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, RoboTwin, and multi-task experiments on the real SO101 robotic arm, MergeVLA achieves performance comparable to or even exceeding individually finetuned experts, demonstrating robust generalization across tasks, embodiments, and environments."}

Current approaches face critical limitations: analytical filtering methods suffer from modeling uncertainties and cumulative drift, hybrid learning-filtering approaches remain constrained by their analytical components, while pure learning-based methods struggle with simulation-to-reality transfer and demand extensive real-world data collection. This paper introduces AutoOdom, a novel autoregressive proprioceptive odometry system that overcomes these challenges through an innovative two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 employs large-scale simulation data to learn complex nonlinear dynamics and rapidly changing contact states inherent in legged locomotion, while Stage 2 introduces an autoregressive enhancement mechanism using limited real-world data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. The key innovation lies in our autoregressive training approach, where the model learns from its own predictions to develop resilience against sensor noise and improve robustness in highly dynamic environments. Comprehensive experimental validation on the Booster T1 humanoid robot demonstrates that AutoOdom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation metrics, achieving 57.2% improvement in absolute trajectory error, 59.2% improvement in Umeyama-aligned error, and 36.2% improvement in relative pose error compared to the Legolas baseline. Extensive ablation studies provide critical insights into sensor modality selection and temporal modeling, revealing counterintuitive findings about IMU acceleration data and validating our systematic design choices for robust proprioceptive odometry in challenging locomotion scenarios."}

We integrate error related potentials decoded from offline-trained EEG classifiers into reward shaping and systematically evaluate the impact of human-feedback weighting. Experiments on a 7-DoF manipulator in an obstacle-rich reaching environment show that neural feedback accelerates reinforcement learning and, depending on the human-feedback weighting, can yield task success rates that at times exceed those of sparse-reward baselines. Moreover, when applying the best-performing feedback weighting across all sub jects, we observe consistent acceleration of reinforcement learning relative to the sparse-reward setting. Furthermore, leave-one subject-out evaluations confirm that the proposed framework remains robust despite the intrinsic inter-individual variability in EEG decodability.

However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach."}

However, it is still challenging to exert high actuation forces on the small robots over a large distance. Permanent magnets offer stronger magnetic torques and forces than electromagnetic coils, however, feedback control is more difficult. As proven by Earnshaw's theorem, it is not possible to achieve a stable magnetic trap in 3D by static permanent magnets. Here, we report a stable 2D magnetic force trap by an array of permanent magnets to control a millirobot. The trap is located in an open space with a tunable distance to the magnet array in the range of 20 - 120mm, which is relevant to human anatomical scales. The design is achieved by a novel GPU-accelerated optimization algorithm that uses mean squared error (MSE) and Adam optimizer to efficiently compute the optimal angles for any number of magnets in the array. The algorithm is verified using numerical simulation and physical experiments with an array of two magnets. A millirobot is successfully trapped and controlled to follow a complex trajectory. The algorithm demonstrates high scalability by optimizing the angles for 100 magnets in under three seconds. Moreover, the optimization workflow can be adapted to optimize a permanent magnet array to achieve the desired force vector fields."}

Through systematic simulation experiments involving 72 unique configurations across varying vehicle densities (15, 35, 55 vehicles) and obstacle frequencies (6, 20 obstacles), we demonstrate that memory-less reactive rerouting increases average travel time by up to 682% compared to baseline conditions. To address this, we introduce Object Memory Management (OMM), a lightweight mechanism enabling agents to retain and share knowledge of previously encountered obstacles. OMM operates by maintaining a distributed blacklist of blocked nodes, which each agent consults during Dijkstra-based path recalculation, effectively preventing redundant routing attempts. Our results show that OMM-enabled coordination reduces average travel time by 75.7% and wait time by 88% compared to memory-less systems, while requiring only 1.67 route recalculations per vehicle versus 9.83 in memory-less scenarios. This work provides empirical evidence that persistent, shared memory is not merely beneficial but essential for robust multi-agent coordination in dynamic environments. The findings have implications beyond autonomous vehicles, informing the design of decentralized systems in robotics, network routing, and distributed AI. We provide a comprehensive experimental analysis, including detailed scenario breakdowns, scalability assessments, and visual documentation of the routing loop phenomenon, demonstrating OMM's critical role in preventing detrimental feedback cycles in cooperative multi-agent systems."}

Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines.

To bridge this gap, we present CUS-GS, a compact unified structured Gaussian Splatting representation, which connects multimodal semantic features with structured 3D geometry. Specifically, we design a voxelized anchor structure that constructs a spatial scaffold, while extracting multimodal semantic features from a set of foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, SEEM). Moreover, we introduce a multimodal latent feature allocation mechanism to unify appearance, geometry, and semantics across heterogeneous feature spaces, ensuring a consistent representation across multiple foundation models. Finally, we propose a feature-aware significance evaluation strategy to dynamically guide anchor growing and pruning, effectively removing redundant or invalid anchors while maintaining semantic integrity. Extensive experiments show that CUS-GS achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods using as few as 6M parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than the closest rival at 35M - highlighting the excellent trade off between performance and model efficiency of the proposed framework."}

In this work, we present ActDistill, a general action-guided self-derived distillation framework that transfers the action prediction capability of any existing VLA model to a lightweight counterpart. Unlike previous efficiency strategies that primarily emphasize vision-language correlations, ActDistill leverages action priors to guide knowledge transfer and model compression, achieving action-oriented efficiency for VLA models. Specifically, we employ a well-trained VLA model as the teacher and introduce a graph-structured encapsulation strategy to explicitly model the hierarchical evolution of action prediction. The student model, derived from the graph-encapsulated teacher, is further equipped with a dynamic router that adaptively selects computation paths based on action prediction demands, guided by hierarchical graph-informed supervision to ensure smooth and efficient evolution. During inference, graph-related auxiliary components are removed, allowing the student to execute only dynamically routed layers and predict high-precision actions with minimal computation and latency. Experiments on embodied benchmarks demonstrate that ActDistill achieves comparable or superior performance to full-scale VLA models while reducing computation by over 50% with up to 1.67 times speedup, thereby establishing a general paradigm toward efficient embodied intelligence."}

SciPy's spatial.transform module is a rigorously tested Python implementation. However, it historically only supported NumPy, limiting adoption in GPU-accelerated and autodiff-based workflows. We present a complete overhaul of SciPy's spatial.transform functionality that makes it compatible with any array library implementing the Python array API, including JAX, PyTorch, and CuPy. The revised implementation preserves the established SciPy interface while enabling GPU/TPU execution, JIT compilation, vectorized batching, and differentiation via native autodiff of the chosen backend. We demonstrate how this foundation supports differentiable scientific computing through two case studies: (i) scalability of 3D transforms and rotations and (ii) a JAX drone simulation that leverages SciPy's Rotation for accurate integration of rotational dynamics.

We instantiate the framework for groups/groupoids, posets/lattices, graphs and cellular sheaves, deriving universal approximation theorems for them in a systematic manner. Categorical equivariant deep learning thus allows us to expand the horizons of equivariant deep learning beyond group actions, encompassing not only geometric symmetries but also contextual and compositional symmetries."}

Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance.\n  This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations.\n  Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations."}

Our comprehensive evaluation on CFG-Bench reveals that leading MLLMs struggle to produce detailed instructions for physical interactions and exhibit profound limitations in the higher-order reasoning of intention and evaluation. Moreover, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our data demonstrates that teaching an MLLMs to articulate fine-grained actions directly translates to significant performance gains on established embodied benchmarks.

However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution.

However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN.

Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability."}
