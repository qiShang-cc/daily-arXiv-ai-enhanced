Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了雷达数字信号处理中的电离层失真和多普勒色散校正问题，提出了两种通用算法（基于FFT的电离层校正和基于sinc插值的多普勒校正），并验证了其在GPU上的实时性。

Method: 提出基于FFT和sinc插值的两种算法，适用于任意波形，并在NVIDIA H100 GPU上实现实时处理。

Result: 两种算法在精度上等同于波形特定方法，且在GPU上实现了实时性能。

Conclusion: 通用算法提高了系统灵活性，易于集成到现有软件定义无线电系统中。

Abstract: General requirements for radar digital signal processing are ionospheric
distortion and Doppler dispersion correction, which has historically required
radar-specific hardware to implement in real time. Although analog solutions
are computationally efficient, they often come with system design drawbacks
which limit waveform flexibility and can result in an overall increase of
system complexity. With improvements in modern general compute systems,
real-time digital signal processing is becoming more realizable using
non-radar-specific high-performance compute. In this paper, we present an
analysis of general Doppler and ionospheric correction algorithms for arbitrary
waveforms for radar digital signal processing. We also include considerations
for efficient implementation of these algorithms in software, specifically
using GPU hardware. This analysis includes metrics of performance such as
execution time and error correction accuracy. We also provide recommendations
for application in radar signal processing. We identify two algorithms for
dispersion correction: an FFT-based method for ionospheric dispersion and a
numerical interpolation method via sinc interpolation for Doppler dispersion.
Both of these algorithms are able to compensate for dispersion equivalent in
accuracy to waveform-specific analytical methods and were able to be performed
in real-time on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. These methods are waveform agnostic
and applied directly to the samples, improving system flexibility and making
them easy to incorporate into existing software-defined radio systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用分布式可重构智能超表面天线（RIMSA）进行无线传感的方法，通过深度强化学习优化波束成形模式，并结合神经网络提高传感准确性，同时设计了抗干扰的损失函数，有效提升了恶劣环境下的传感性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的射频传感方法因传播信道的不利影响（如衰落和噪声）导致准确性受限，且容易被恶意干扰。研究旨在通过分布式RIMSA系统优化信号接收质量，进而提升传感性能。

Result: 仿真结果显示，分布式RIMSA系统比集中式实现更高效，能更好地克服环境影响，且在干扰攻击下仍能保持高精度传感性能。

Conclusion: 分布式RIMSA结合DRL和神经网络的方法能够显著提升恶劣传播环境和干扰攻击下的传感性能，为无线传感提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has
garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable
and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods
is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the
receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing
distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect
the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)
are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,
RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem
is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping
of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we
introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating
the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting
received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may
potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable
effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss
function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed
distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and
better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation.
Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance
even under jamming attack.

### [3] [Localized Kernel Methods for Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04978)
*Sippanon Kitimoon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种基于局部核的信号处理方法，用于噪声条件下参数恢复，分别在多维指数模型和线性调频信号分离中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对噪声条件下参数恢复的挑战，论文旨在开发高效且鲁棒的方法，以超越传统子空间算法（如MUSIC和ESPRIT）。

Method: 第一种方法使用局部三角多项式核检测多变量频率，结合坐标投影和配准；第二种方法通过局部核构建信号分离算子，利用FFT滤波和回归拟合。

Result: 在低信噪比下，方法优于传统算法，且在多变量情况下样本需求更少。调频信号分离方法能处理低至-30 dB的噪声信号。

Conclusion: 两种方法均基于局部核和高效FFT实现，无需子空间分解或稀疏正则化，展示了广泛的适用性和扩展潜力。

Abstract: This dissertation presents two signal processing methods using specially
designed localized kernels for parameter recovery under noisy condition. The
first method addresses the estimation of frequencies and amplitudes in
multidimensional exponential models. It utilizes localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels to detect the multivariate frequencies, followed by a more
detailed parameter estimation. We compare our method with MUSIC and ESPRIT,
which are classical subspace-based algorithms widely used for estimating the
parameters of exponential signals. In the univariate case, the method
outperforms MUSIC and ESPRIT under low signal-to-noise ratios. For the
multivariate case, we develop a coordinate-wise projection and registration
approach that achieves high recovery accuracy using significantly fewer samples
than other methods.
  The second method focuses on separating linear chirp components from
time-localized signal segments. A variant of the Signal Separation Operator
(SSO) is constructed using a localized kernel. Instantaneous frequency
estimates are obtained via FFT-based filtering, then clustered and fitted with
piecewise linear regression. The method operates without prior knowledge of the
number of components and is shown to recover intersecting and discontinuous
chirps at SNR levels as low as -30 dB.
  Both methods share an idea based on localized kernels and efficient FFT-based
implementation, and neither requires subspace decomposition or sparsity
regularization. Experimental results confirm the robustness and tractability of
the proposed approaches across a range of simulated data conditions. Potential
extensions include application to nonlinear chirps, adaptive kernel design, and
signal classification using extracted features.

### [4] [Power-Constrained and Quantized MIMO-RSMA Systems with Imperfect CSIT: Joint Precoding, Antenna Selection, and Power Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05080)
*Jiwon Sung,Seokjun Park,Jinseok Choi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联合预编码、天线选择和功率控制的算法，旨在最大化基站的总功率预算利用率，用于下行多用户MIMO RSMA系统，并考虑了DAC分辨率的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了充分利用基站的总功率预算，并解决多用户MIMO RSMA系统中因DAC分辨率和CSIT不完美带来的挑战。

Method: 将问题分解为预编码方向和功率控制子问题，分别通过拉格朗日驻点法和梯度下降法求解，并提出了一种适用于大规模MIMO系统的复杂度降低方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，算法有效且在使用基站全功率预算时，8-11位中等分辨率DAC比低分辨率DAC更具能效。

Conclusion: 论文提出的算法显著提升了系统性能，同时揭示了在特定场景下中等分辨率DAC的优势。

Abstract: To utilize the full potential of the available power at a base station (BS),
we propose a joint precoding, antenna selection, and transmit power control
algorithm for a total power budget at the BS. We formulate a sum spectral
efficiency (SE) maximization problem for downlink multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems with
arbitrary-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs). We reformulate the
problem by defining the ergodic sum SE using the conditional average rate
approach to handle imperfect channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT), and by using approximation techniques to make the problem more
tractable. Then, we decompose the problem into precoding direction and power
control subproblems. We solve the precoding direction subproblem by identifying
a superior Lagrangian stationary point, and the power control subproblem using
gradient descent. We also propose a complexity-reduction approach that is more
suitable for massive MIMO systems. Simulation results not only validate the
proposed algorithm but also reveal that when utilizing the full potential of
the power budget at the BS, medium-resolution DACs with 8-11 bits may actually
be more power-efficient than low-resolution DACs.

### [5] [Digital Twin Channel-Aided CSI Prediction: A Environment-based Subspace Extraction Approach for Achieving Low Overhead and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05142)
*Yichen Cai,Jianhua Zhang,Li Yu,Zhen Zhang,Yuxiang Zhang,Lianzheng Shi,Yuelong Qiu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于环境特定信道子空间基（EB）的部分到全信道状态信息（CSI）预测方法（EB-P2WCP），用于实现低开销的数字孪生信道（DTC）预测，显著降低系统开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为满足6G通信系统在复杂场景中对高鲁棒性和高速通信的需求，利用感知和人工智能的数字孪生信道（DTC）技术成为一种有前景的解决方案。

Method: 通过从数字孪生地图中提取EB作为环境信息先验，并将其与实时估计的局部CSI融合，预测整个空间-频率域信道的当前和未来状态。设计了一个EB-P2WNet网络来实现鲁棒的预测。

Result: 仿真结果显示，EB的引入在低信噪比和低导频比例条件下显著提升了性能，减少了50%的导频开销，并对多用户干扰具有鲁棒性，定位误差容忍度高达3米，预测速度在1.3毫秒内完成。

Conclusion: 所提EB-P2WCP方法在复杂场景下实现了高效、鲁棒的低开销信道预测，为6G通信系统的实现提供了有力支持。

Abstract: To meet the robust and high-speed communication requirements of the
sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system in complex scenarios,
sensing- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twin channel (DTC)
techniques become a promising approach to reduce system overhead. In this
paper, we propose an environment-specific channel subspace basis (EB)-aided
partial-to-whole channel state information (CSI) prediction method (EB-P2WCP)
for realizing DTC-enabled low-overhead channel prediction. Specifically, EB is
utilized to characterize the static properties of the electromagnetic
environment, which is extracted from the digital twin map, serving as
environmental information prior to the prediction task. Then, we fuse EB with
real-time estimated local CSI to predict the entire spatial-frequency domain
channel for both the present and future time instances. Hence, an EB-based
partial-to-whole CSI prediction network (EB-P2WNet) is designed to achieve a
robust channel prediction scheme in various complex scenarios. Simulation
results indicate that incorporating EB provides significant benefits under low
signal-to-noise ratio and pilot ratio conditions, achieving a reduction of up
to 50% in pilot overhead. Additionally, the proposed method maintains
robustness against multi-user interference, tolerating 3-meter localization
errors with only a 0.5 dB NMSE increase, and predicts CSI for the next channel
coherent time within 1.3 milliseconds.

### [6] [Optimization of Liquid Lens-based Imaging Receiver for MIMO VLC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05204)
*Kapila W. S. Palitharathna,Christodoulos Skouroumounis,Ioannis Krikidis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于液体透镜的成像接收器，用于MIMO VLC系统，通过动态调节焦距和角度降低空间相关性，提高BER性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态透镜在动态条件下（如用户移动和随机接收方向）适应性不足的问题。

Method: 开发数学模型建模通道增益，并优化最小化BER；提出两种透镜调整方案（CLS和VULO）。

Result: 数值结果显示，在随机接收方向条件下，液体透镜显著降低BER（从4×10^-2降至5×10^-4）。

Conclusion: 基于液体透镜的系统优于传统静态透镜，尤其在动态环境下表现更佳。

Abstract: In this paper, a liquid lens-based imaging receiver is proposed for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC)
systems. By dynamically adjusting the focal length and orientation angles of
the liquid lens, the spatial correlation between MIMO channel gains is reduced,
leading to enhanced bit-error rate (BER) performance. Unlike static lenses,
liquid lenses offer adaptability in dynamic conditions, including user mobility
and random receiver orientation. An accurate mathematical framework is
developed to model the channel gains of the proposed system, and an
optimization problem is formulated to minimize its BER. Due to the complexity
of the resulting channel model, two lens adjustment schemes, namely, ($i$) the
CLS scheme, and ($ii$) the VULO scheme are introduced. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed liquid lens-based system offers substantial BER
improvements over conventional static lens-based receivers across a wide range
of random receiver orientation conditions. Specifically, at a random receiver
orientation variance of $10^{\circ}$, the BER is improved from $4\times
10^{-2}$ to $5\times 10^{-4}$ by employing the proposed liquid lens.

### [7] [Deep Learning Based Dynamic Environment Reconstruction for Vehicular ISAC Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05226)
*Junzhe Song,Ruisi He,Mi Yang,Zhengyu Zhang,Bingcheng Liu,Jiahui Han,Haoxiang Zhang,Bo Ai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于深度学习的框架，利用ISAC技术实现车辆环境的动态重建，解决了现有方法在跟踪动态场景时的精度和时间一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ISAC技术在动态场景重建中精度和时间一致性不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过多模态测量数据建立联合信道环境数据集，开发多阶段深度学习网络，包括场景解码器、聚类中心解码器和点云解码器。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法实现了高质量的动态环境重建，Chamfer Distance为0.29，F Score@1%为0.87，并验证了实时应用的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来智能交通中基于ISAC的低成本环境重建提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology plays a critical role
in future intelligent transportation systems, by enabling vehicles to perceive
and reconstruct the surrounding environment through reuse of wireless signals,
thereby reducing or even eliminating the need for additional sensors such as
LiDAR or radar. However, existing ISAC based reconstruction methods often lack
the ability to track dynamic scenes with sufficient accuracy and temporal
consistency, limiting the real world applicability. To address this limitation,
we propose a deep learning based framework for vehicular environment
reconstruction by using ISAC channels. We first establish a joint channel
environment dataset based on multi modal measurements from real world urban
street scenarios. Then, a multistage deep learning network is developed to
reconstruct the environment. Specifically, a scene decoder identifies the
environmental context such as buildings, trees and so on; a cluster center
decoder predicts coarse spatial layouts by localizing dominant scattering
centers; a point cloud decoder recovers fine grained geometry and structure of
surrounding environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves high-quality dynamic environment reconstruction with a Chamfer
Distance of 0.29 and F Score@1% of 0.87. In addition, complexity analysis
demonstrates the efficiency and practical applicability of the method in real
time scenarios. This work provides a pathway toward low cost environment
reconstruction based on ISAC for future intelligent transportation.

### [8] [Unifying Common Signal Analyses with Instantaneous Time-Frequency Atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05380)
*Steven Sandoval,Phillip L. De Leon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一个通过瞬时时间-频率原子统一多种信号分析方法的框架，并推导了对应的瞬时频谱的闭式表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作提出了瞬时时间-频率分析的通用框架，但未具体说明如何计算特定瞬时频谱（IS）。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用瞬时时间-频率原子，结合多种信号分析方法（如时域分析、频域分析、分数傅里叶变换等），推导IS的闭式表达式。

Result: 通过将信号分析视为AM-FM分解，并利用二次chirplet模板，将IS组织为2D连续体，实现了方法的统一。

Conclusion: 通过具体信号示例验证了方法的有效性，展示了如何从通用框架中推导特定IS。

Abstract: In previous work, we presented a general framework for instantaneous
time-frequency analysis but did not provide any specific details of how to
compute a particular instantaneous spectrum (IS). In this work, we use
instantaneous time-frequency atoms to obtain an IS associated with common
signal analyses: time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, fractional
Fourier transform, synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, and
synchrosqueezed short-time fractional Fourier transform. By doing so, we
demonstrate how the general framework can be used to unify these analyses and
we develop closed-form expressions for the corresponding ISs. This is
accomplished by viewing these analyses as decompositions into AM--FM components
and recognizing that each uses a specialized (or limiting) form of a quadratic
chirplet as a template during analysis. With a two-parameter quadratic
chirplet, we can organize these ISs into a 2D continuum with points in the
plane corresponding to a decomposition related to one of the signal analyses.
Finally, using several example signals, we compute in closed-form the ISs for
the various analyses.

Motivation: 为了实现设备的超小型化、无限寿命和低成本，同时解决WiFi发射器的微瓦级功耗问题。

Method: 通过消除本地振荡器，利用双音入射波的二阶互调提取频率，并在标签间共享音调发生器以实现传感。

Result: 实现了-19 dBm的最小灵敏度，同时无需电池或外部运动传感器。

Conclusion: 该技术突破了传统WiFi发射器的功耗限制，为无电池、低成本的小型化设备提供了新可能。

Abstract: In this paper, a sub-uW power 802.11b backscattering transmitter is presented
to enable reuse of the same incident wave for three purposes: RF harvesting,
backscattering communications and position/motion sensing. The removal of the
battery and any off-chip motion sensor (e.g., MEMS) enables unprecedented level
of miniaturization and ubiquity, unrestricted device lifespan, low fabrication
and maintenance cost. The uW power wall for WiFi transmitters is broken for the
first time via local oscillator elimination, as achieved by extracting its
frequency through second-order intermodulation of a twotone incident wave. The
two-tone scheme also enables a cumulative harvesting/transmission/sensing
sensitivity down to Pmin -19 dBm. Position/motion sensing is enabled by using
the harvested voltage as a proxy for the Received Signal Strength (RSS),
allowing to sense the chip location with respect to the tone generator(s)
shared across tags in indoor neighborhoods.

Abstract: A four-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) for ultra-low-power
applications is introduced in this paper. The proposed circuit inclusive of
frequency compensation requires minimal transistor count and passives,
overcoming the traditionally difficult compensation of 4-stage OTAs and
bringing it back to the simplicity of 3-stage OTAs. At the same time, the
proposed circuit achieves high power efficiency, as evidenced by the >3.7X
(>11.3X) improvement in the large-signal (small-signal) power efficiency figure
of merit FOML (FOMS), compared to prior 4-stage OTAs (sub-1 V multi-stage
OTAs). Thanks to the lower sensitivity of the phase margin to the load
capacitance, the proposed OTA remains stable under a wide range of loads
(double-sided as in any 3-4-stage OTA), achieving a max/min ratio of the load
capacitance of >100X.

Abstract: This paper investigates the energy efficiency optimization for movable

formulated to optimize the MA position, and an efficient algorithm based on

integrating movable antennas (MAs) into the system for enhancing overall system
performance. Specifically, multiple MA-enabled AVVs perform sensing tasks and
simultaneously transmit the generated computational tasks to the base station
for processing. To minimize the maximum latency under the sensing and resource
constraints, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly coordinates the
position of the MAs, the computation resource allocation, and the transmit
beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and strong
coupling among variables, we propose a two-layer iterative algorithm leveraging
particle swarm optimization and convex optimization to address it. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant
latency improvements compared to the baseline schemes.

*Chi-Sheng Chen,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出Q-DPTS，一种结合量子变分电路的量子-经典混合差分隐私时间序列预测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融和能源系统等数据敏感性高的领域，经典差分隐私方法可能损害模型性能。

Method: Q-DPTS结合变分量子电路（VQC）、逐样本梯度裁剪和高斯噪声注入，实现严格差分隐私。

Result: 在ETT数据集上，Q-DPTS在相同隐私预算下预测误差更低。

Conclusion: Q-DPTS为隐私关键场景提供了安全且准确的量子增强时间序列建模方法。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is
paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP)
provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its
integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to
injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical
framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS
combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping
and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables
improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We
evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a
standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is
compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA,
QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower
prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable
privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations
into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising
directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的最大似然估计器需要大量废弃数据或导频符号，导致符号效率显著下降，且估计与协调阶段的分离可能引入误差传播。

Method: 论文采用期望最大化（EM）算法，提出了一种联合消息传递方案，在解码过程中同时估计未知参数，无需单独的最大似然估计。此外，引入了混合多维旋转方案以减少经典信道开销。

Result: 该方法首次在CV-QKD中统一了多维协调和信道参数估计，为高效协调提供了实用解决方案，并减少了导频需求。

Conclusion: 联合方案显著提高了CV-QKD的信息协调效率和符号利用率，同时降低了信道开销。

Abstract: Accurate quantum channel parameter estimation is essential for effective
information reconciliation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution
(CV-QKD). However, conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimators rely on a
large amount of discarded data (or pilot symbols), leading to a significant
loss in symbol efficiency. Moreover, the separation between the estimation and
reconciliation phases can introduce error propagation. In this paper, we
propose a novel joint message-passing scheme that unifies channel parameter
estimation and information reconciliation within a Bayesian framework. By
leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method
simultaneously estimates unknown parameters during decoding, eliminating the
need for separate ML estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid
multidimensional rotation scheme that removes the requirement for norm
feedback, significantly reducing classical channel overhead. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to unify multidimensional reconciliation and
channel parameter estimation in CV-QKD, providing a practical solution for
high-efficiency reconciliation with minimal pilots.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Abstract: This paper presents a joint framework that integrates reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) with Terahertz (THz) communications and
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance smart industrial
communications. The proposed system leverages the advantages of RIS and THz
bands to improve spectral efficiency, coverage, and reliability key
requirements for industrial automation and real-time communications in future
6G networks and beyond. Within this framework, two power allocation strategies
are investigated: the first optimally distributes power between near and far
industrial nodes, and the second prioritizes network demands to enhance system
performance further. A performance evaluation is conducted to compare the sum
rate and outage probability against a fixed power allocation scheme. Our scheme
achieves up to a 23% sum rate gain over fixed PA at 30 dBm. Simulation results
validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness and
robustness of the RIS-assisted NOMA MIMO framework for THz enabled industrial
communications.

### [17] [Phase Noise Tolerance for Low-Pilot-Overhead OFDM Terahertz Links Beyond 64-QAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05026)

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 论文探讨了THz无线通信中高阶调制格式（如超过64-QAM）的挑战，特别是相位噪声对OFDM传输的影响，并提出了一种量化相位噪声容忍度的方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究THz通信中高阶调制的可行性，解决相位噪声对OFDM系统性能的限制问题。

Method: 分析了64-QAM、2048子载波OFDM THz系统中的相位噪声影响，并提出3σ误差估计法量化容忍度。

Result: 发现约5%的EVM阈值能平衡相位噪声、SNR需求和导频开销，并指出微环谐振器（MRRs）是实现低导频开销的关键。

Conclusion: 量化相位噪声容忍度对高阶调制THz通信协议设计至关重要，MRRs是实现高效系统的必要技术。

Abstract: THz wireless communications have garnered significant attention due to their
unprecedented data rates enabled by the abundant untapped spectrum. However,
advanced modulation formats beyond 64-QAM remain largely unexplored, as phase
errors introduced during up/down-conversion severely limit system performance.
Particularly, OFDM transmission is highly susceptible to aggravated ICI induced
by phase noise, undermining the orthogonality of subcarriers. While PLLs and
pilot-assisted compensation can mitigate phase errors, excessive pilot overhead
compromises spectral efficiency and energy consumption, and white phase noise
remains unrecoverable. Therefore, quantifying phase noise tolerance is
essential for practical physical layer protocols. Here, we reveal the impact of
phase noise in a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM THz transmission system.
3{\sigma}-error estimation is proposed to quantify phase noise tolerance,
indicating an intuitive EVM threshold of approximately 5%. This threshold
further delineates the trade-offs among phase noise levels, SNR requirements,
and pilot overhead. Moreover, by benchmarking representative oscillators with
distinct phase noise spectra, microring resonators (MRRs) are identified as
indispensable enablers for low-pilot-overhead OFDM THz links operating beyond
64-QAM.
