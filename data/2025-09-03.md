### [1] [Exploring the Efficacy of Convolutional Neural Networks in Sleep Apnea Detection from Single Channel EEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00012)
*Chun Hin Siu,Hossein Miri*

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠呼吸暂停是一种常见的睡眠障碍，传统诊断方法PSG成本高且不便，亟需更高效、便捷的诊断方案。

Method: 采用CNN模型处理单通道EEG数据，结合IIR Butterworth滤波器预处理、数据集构建方法和SMOTETomek技术解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型准确率达85.1%，MCC为0.22，展示了在家用场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Sleep apnea, a prevalent sleep disorder, involves repeated episodes of
breathing interruptions during sleep, leading to various health complications,
including cognitive impairments, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke,
and even death. One of the main challenges in diagnosing and treating sleep
apnea is identifying individuals at risk. The current gold standard for
diagnosis, Polysomnography (PSG), is costly, labor intensive, and inconvenient,
often resulting in poor quality sleep data. This paper presents a novel
approach to the detection of sleep apnea using a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained on single channel EEG data. The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy
of 85.1% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.22, demonstrating a
significant potential for home based applications by addressing the limitations
of PSG in automated sleep apnea detection. Key contributions of this work also
include the development of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with an
Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth filter, a dataset construction
method providing broader temporal context, and the application of SMOTETomek to
address class imbalance. This research underscores the feasibility of
transitioning from traditional laboratory based diagnostics to more accessible,
automated home based solutions, improving patient outcomes and broadening the
accessibility of sleep disorder diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The paper presents an approach in which inertial signals measured with a
wrist-worn sensor (e.g., a smartwatch) are translated into those that would be
recorded using a shoe-mounted sensor, enabling the use of state-of-the-art gait
analysis methods. In the study, the signals are translated using Conditional
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Two different GAN versions are used for
experimental verification: traditional ones trained using binary cross-entropy
loss and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs). For the generator, two architectures, a
convolutional autoencoder, and a convolutional U-Net, are tested. The
experiment results have shown that the proposed approach allows for an accurate
translation, enabling the use of wrist sensor inertial signals for efficient,
every-day gait analysis.

### [3] [A Fluid Antenna Enabled Physical Layer Key Generation for Next-G Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00018)
*Jiacheng Guo,Ning Gao,Yiping Zuo,Hao Xu,Shi Jin,Kai Kit Wong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于流体天线（FA）的物理层密钥生成（PLKG）系统，以解决恶劣传播环境中密钥生成率（KGR）下降的问题，并通过优化算法显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的物理层密钥生成技术在恶劣传播环境中性能下降，亟需一种能够提升密钥生成率的方法。

Method: 提出了一种FA阵列的PLKG系统，推导了KGR的闭式表达式，并分别采用粒子群优化（PSO）算法和交替优化（AO）算法优化了预编码矩阵和天线位置。

Result: 仿真结果表明，FA-PLKG系统在KGR性能上显著优于传统固定位置天线（FPA）和可重构智能表面（RIS），分别实现了35.42%（PSO）和67.73%（AO）的性能提升。

Conclusion: FA-PLKG系统通过引入空间自由度，有效提升了恶劣环境下的密钥生成性能，具有较强的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As a promising physical layer security technique, physical layer key
generation (PLKG) enables legitimate users to obtain secret keys from wireless
channel without security infrastructures. However, in harsh propagation
environments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key
generation rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose
a novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge.
Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA
array, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions
via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the
computational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient
descent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting
the additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is
superior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna
(FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth
highlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA),
the FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\% KGR performance improvement under PSO
algorithm and a 67.73\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm,
respectively.

Conclusion: 提出了传感器尺寸和非侵入性鞋垫设计的指南，并指出未来发展方向为多模态传感器和多轴传感技术。

Abstract: Plantar pressure measurement, or pedobarography, is an essential tool for
analyzing human motion in healthy individuals and patients. Across the reviewed
literature, sensor insoles are motivated as wearable, mobile solutions for
assessing pressure distribution in applications including diabetic foot
monitoring, rehabilitation guidance, assistive device control, and sports
performance analysis. This review evaluates the current state of the art with
particular attention to sensor technologies, sensor quantity and placement,
participant cohorts, and reference standards. The focus lies on original works
with innovative designs, preferably supported by ambulation experiments. The
modalities covered include resistive, capacitive, inductive, piezoelectric,
triboelectric, and optical sensing approaches. We identify a lack of proper
sensor calibration, gait-based verification, and human study validation, and
propose a gold standard based on testing machines and instrumented treadmills
to ensure comparability across studies. The bidirectional interaction between
insole insertion and foot-sole mechanics is examined, with tissue stiffness
identified as a key source of uncertainty in sensor signals. Guidelines are
provided for sensor dimensions and unobtrusive insole designs to foster natural
gait. Finally, future directions include the development of multimodal sensors
to compensate for limitations of individual modalities and the emerging trend
of multiaxial sensing for capturing shear components in pressure distributions.

### [5] [CoMET: A Contrastive-Masked Brain Foundation Model for Universal EEG Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00314)
*Ang Li,Zikai Wang,Liuyin Yang,Zhenyu Wang,Tianheng Xu,Honglin Hu,Marc M. Van Hulle*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: CoMET是一种新型的大脑基础模型，通过改进的掩码自编码器和对比学习框架提升EEG信号的全局区分能力，并在多个下游任务中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG深度模型局限于特定数据集和任务，且现有自监督模型过度关注局部信号相似性而忽视全局区分模式。

Method: 使用改进的掩码自编码器作为主干，结合镜像尺度增强的对比学习框架，预训练于超过3000名被试的EEG数据。

Result: 在十个下游数据集上的评估表明，CoMET具有提取通用EEG表征的能力和显著的临床潜力。

Conclusion: CoMET通过增强全局区分能力，显著提升了EEG表征的通用性和适用性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
activity, widely used in brain-computer interfaces, clinic, and healthcare.
Traditional EEG deep models typically focus on specific dataset and task,
limiting model size and generalization. Recently, self-supervised brain
foundation models have emerged and been applied to various downstream tasks.
Nevertheless, these models still have limitations: current SOTA models
typically rely on masked reconstruction strategy; however, EEG features of
adjacent channels are highly correlated, which causes the pre-training to
overly focus on low-dimensional signal-similarity features in local regions and
neglect the global discriminative patterns vital for downstream tasks. To
address these limitations, we propose a brain foundation model called CoMET.
Specifically, we employ the masked autoencoder with redesigned patching and
embedding for EEG as backbone and devise a novel contrastive learning framework
with mirror-scale augmentation to strengthen the global discrimination ability.
CoMET is pre-trained on mixed EEG datasets over 3000 subjects with over one
million samples. It is evaluated on ten different downstream datasets, and the
SOTA results demonstrate CoMET's superior ability in extracting universal EEG
representations and strong clinical potential.

### [6] [Gait Analysis using 6DoF Magnetic Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00323)
*R. Abhishek Shankar,Hyungjun Ha,Byunghoo Jung*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于6自由度磁跟踪的步态分析系统，便携且高效，用于人类活动识别，分类性能优于IMU+磁力计系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升穿戴式设备在步态分析中的性能，弥补其相对于非穿戴设备在信息提供上的不足。

Method: 使用6自由度磁跟踪系统，结合CNN和LSTM深度学习分类器，分类四种活动（步行、负重步行、慢跑、原地踏步）。

Result: 磁跟踪系统的分类准确率达92%，比IMU+磁力计系统（86.69%）更优，尤其在区分步行和负重步行上提升8%。

Conclusion: 6自由度磁跟踪系统可行且高效，证明了其在步态分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Gait analysis using wearable devices has advantages over non-wearable devices
when it comes to portability and accessibility. However, non-wearable devices
have consistently shown superior performance in terms of the gait information
they can provide. This calls for the need to improve the performance of
wearable device based gait analysis. To that end, we developed a 6
Degrees-of-Freedom (6DoF) magnetic tracking based gait analysis system as a
step in this direction. The system is portable, minimally intrusive, wireless
and power efficient. As a proof-of-concept, the system was used for the task of
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to classify four tasks - walking (W), walking
with weight (WW), jogging (J) and marching on the spot (M). Gait data of 12
participants was collected. The classification performance of two deep learning
(DL) classifiers - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) - was compared. The performance of the magnetic tracking based
gait analysis system was also compared with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
+ magnetometer based system. The magnetic tracking based system showed an
overall classification accuracy of 92\% compared to 86.69\% for the IMU +
magnetometer system. Moreover, the magnetic tracking system showed an
improvement of about 8\% in being able to differentiate between W and WW. This
highlights the insufficiency in the information content in the data from IMU +
magnetometer, warranting the need for a complete 6DoF tracking. Our work, thus,
proves the feasibility of using magnetic tracking systems for the purpose of
gait analysis.

Conclusion: 该研究为混合场SWIPT系统的安全设计提供了理论和实践指导，优化了加权和保密率并满足能量收集需求。

Abstract: This letter investigates secure hybrid beamforming (HB) design for an
extremely large-scale antenna array-aided simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT) system operating in a mixed near-field (NF)/far-field
(FF) environment. A base station (BS) employs HB to transmit information and
artificial noise (AN) signals simultaneously to multiple FF information
receivers (IRs) and NF energy receivers (ERs). The objective is to maximize the
weighted sum secrecy rate for the IRs, considering both Type-I (unable to
cancel AN) and Type-II (capable of canceling AN) IRs, subject to minimum energy
harvesting requirements at the ERs and a BS transmit power constraint. We
formulate optimization problems for both IR types and develop an efficient
iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation. Simulation
results validate the proposed scheme and provide crucial insights into the
security performance of mixed-field SWIPT systems, highlighting the influence
of visibility regions and angular user separation.

Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges in cell-freemassive multiple input
multiple output (CF-mMIMO) systems:efficient pilot allocation and practical
receiver design. To thisend, we introduce a novel pilot allocation framework
leveragingmanifold optimization to maximize the system sum rate, wherepilot
sequences are designed as nearly orthogonal sequences. Theproposed pilot design
enforces unimodularity constraints in thefrequency domain, ensuring pilots are
suitable for both communi-cation and sensing tasks. Additionally, a gaussian
belief propaga-tion (GaBP)-based receiver is introduced, providing
near-optimaldetection performance with substantially reduced
computationalcomplexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposedpilot
allocation method achieves communication performancecomparable to
state-of-the-art (SotA) algorithms, while deliveringsuperior sensing
capabilities due to its unimodular pilot design.The GaBP-based receiver
achieves robust performance andlower complexity compared to conventional
approaches. Thesecontributions advance the practical deployment of CF-mMIMOfor
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚太赫兹频段的广阔带宽为高速无线接入、精确定位和高级传感应用提供了巨大潜力，但物理约束和技术限制使其部署面临挑战。

Method: 使用聚合物微波光纤（PMF）连接低复杂度RU，分布式架构确保用户设备（UE）与最近的RU连接。此外，提出双频串联操作，结合亚10 GHz系统。

Conclusion: 这种新型架构可充分发挥亚太赫兹技术的潜力，为动态环境提供成本低、能效高的实时连接解决方案。

Abstract: The vast bandwidth available at sub-THz frequencies holds great promise for
high-speed wireless access, precise localization, and advanced sensing
applications. However, fundamental physical constraints and technological
limitations make the deployment of reliable sub-THz networks challenging. We
propose a new paradigm for sub-THz coverage by transmitting the RF signals over
polymer microwave fibers (PMFs) that interconnect low-complexity radio units
(RUs) in a daisy-chain configuration. The distributed architecture ensures that
user equipments (UEs) connect to RUs in their proximity, reducing path loss and
mitigating blocking. The RUs leverage low-complexity, compact integrated
antenna modules. Additionally, dual-frequency tandem operation is proposed,
integrating the sub-THz system with a sub-10 GHz system that provides control
signalling and a robust fallback solution for the sub-THz system. This proposed
tandem architecture can open up the full potential of sub-THz technology and
paves the way to cost- and energy-efficient, high-performance, real-time
connectivity in dynamic environments.

### [10] [Robust Resource Allocation for LEO Satellite-Assisted Secure SWIPT via STAR-RIS under CSI Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00568)
*Zahra Rostamikafaki,Francois Chan,Claude D'Amours*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个鲁棒的资源分配框架，用于低地球轨道(LEO)卫星支持的同时无线信息和能量传输(SWIPT)系统，借助地面部署的同时发射和反射可重构智能表面(STAR-RIS)。在直接卫星-地面链路受阻的情况下，通过STAR-RIS服务多个接收器和窃听器，优化问题旨在最大化总能量收集，同时满足保密率和功率限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决直接卫星-地面链路受阻时的资源分配问题，并通过STAR-RIS提升SWIPT系统的性能。

Method: 采用鲁棒优化方法处理信道不确定性，提出交替优化(AO)框架联合优化主动和被动波束成形，并结合惩罚策略确保STAR-RIS设计。

Result: 仿真表明STAR-RIS架构在总能量收集方面优于传统RIS和其他基线方案。

Conclusion: STAR-RIS在LEO卫星支持的SWIPT系统中具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: This paper proposes a robust resource allocation framework for a low Earth
orbit (LEO) satellite-enabled simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) system, assisted by a ground-deployed simultaneously
transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). We
consider a scenario where direct satellite-to-ground links are obstructed, and
the satellite serves multiple single-antenna energy receivers, information
receivers, and eavesdroppers exclusively via the STAR-RIS. A robust
optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total harvested power,
subject to secrecy rate requirements, transmit power limits, and STAR-RIS
coefficient constraints, under a practical bounded channel state information
(CSI) error model. To achieve optimal robust resource allocation, we address
the challenges posed by coupled optimization variables and bounded channel
estimation errors by first applying the S-procedure to handle robustness
against channel uncertainty. An alternating optimization (AO) framework is
subsequently proposed, where the active beamforming at the LEO satellite and
the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS are jointly optimized, and a
penalty-based strategy is incorporated to enforce the STAR-RIS beamforming
design. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
and demonstrate that the STAR-RIS architecture achieves substantial performance
gains in total harvested power over conventional RIS and other baseline
schemes.

Conclusion: PyNoetic是一个灵活、易用且功能全面的BCI框架，适合不同研究背景的用户，有望推动BCI研究的发展。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have
emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics,
virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks
face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential
for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without
programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software,
and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external
tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present
PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI
research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses
the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition
to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and
finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive
and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart
for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal
programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless
integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding,
ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array
of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity
indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation
methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for
both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design
process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI
development and thus accelerate their research endeavors. Project Website:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于定位误差下限（PELB）的乒乓定位框架，用于提升毫米波系统中动态用户设备的定位与追踪性能。通过多维信息融合和交替优化算法，优化了波束形成设计，并验证了其高准确性和资源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升毫米波系统中动态用户设备的定位与追踪性能，尤其是在宽频带和多路径环境下。

Method: 1) 提出多子载波协作定位误差下限（MSCPEB）；2) 设计交替优化（AO）算法优化混合波束形成；3) 开发多路径协作定位方法。

Result: 方法在无需路径分辨和传统三角关系的情况下，将估计准确性至少提升16%，且仅需约四分之一的时隙资源。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和算法显著提高了毫米波系统中的定位性能，资源效率高，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: To enhance the positioning and tracking performance of dynamic user equipment
(UE) in wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems, we propose a novel
positioning error lower bound (PELB)-driven ping-pong positioning framework,
where the base station (BS) and UE alternately transmit and receive adaptive
beamforming signals for positioning. All beam-formers are scheduled based on
the locally evaluated PELB. In this framework, we exploit multi-dimensional
information fusion to assist in positioning. Firstly, a multi-subcarrier
collaborative positioning error lower bound (MSCPEB) is proposed to evaluate
the positioning error limits of wideband mmWave systems, which quantifies the
contribution of all subcarriers to positioning accuracy. Moreover, we prove
that the MSCPEB does not exceed the arithmetic mean of the PELBs of the
individual subcarriers. Subsequently, we develop an alternating optimization
(AO) algorithm to optimize the hybrid beamformers targeted for MSCPEB
minimization. By convexifying this problem, closed-form solutions of
beamformers are derived. Finally, we develop a multipath collaborative
positioning method that quantifies the impact of path reliability on
positioning accuracy, with a closed-form solution for user position derived.
The proposed method does not rely on path resolution and traditional triangular
relationships. Numerical results validate that the proposed method improves
estimation accuracy by at least 16% compared to potential schemes without
optimized beam configurations, while requiring only approximately one-quarter
of the slot resources.

Abstract: Satellite missions demand ever greater connectivity, especially in the LEO

services to Earth's users, can provide excellent connectivity to LEO spacecraft
as well. First, we characterise the communication link between space users and
the actual OneWeb and Starlink constellations. A full set of results in terms
of availability, access duration, Doppler, and path losses as a function of
user orbital parameters, identifying optimal user orbits, is provided. The
results achieved by a multi-system user able to communicate with both fleets
are also presented. The potential improvements available if geostationary
constellations are used to complement LEO megaconstellations in a multi-orbit
system are discussed as well. Finally, we focus on two LEO use cases: the
International Space Station and an Earth Observation Sun Synchronous satellite.
All the results demonstrate the numerous advantages of the mega-constellation
connectivity solution, which can transform LEO spacecraft into highly
responsive nodes of a space-to-space network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近场MIMO雷达成像由于分布式天线的不规则空间采样而面临高计算负荷，现有加速方法依赖插值或测量补偿，限制了其对不同MIMO几何结构的适应性。

Method: 采用随机近端梯度法开发了一种快速正则化重建方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著减少了运行时间，同时保持了重建质量。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决近场MIMO成像的计算负荷问题提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar imaging suffers from
high computational load inherently due to irregular spatial sampling with
distributed antennas. Existing acceleration methods for near-field MIMO imaging
typically rely on interpolation or compensation of measurements and are
primarily developed for direct reconstruction. This hinders their ease of
adoption for different MIMO geometries and requires further modification for
regularized inversion. In this study, we address these challenges by developing
a fast regularized reconstruction approach for three-dimensional near-field
MIMO imaging based on the Stochastic Proximal Gradient Method. We demonstrate
the performance of the developed approach through experimental measurements.
The results show a significant improvement in runtime without any notable

Abstract: Optimization-based solvers play a central role in a wide range of signal
processing and communication tasks. However, their applicability in
latency-sensitive systems is limited by the sequential nature of iterative
methods and the high computational cost per iteration. While deep unfolding has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for converting iterative algorithms into learned
models that operate with a fixed number of iterations, it does not inherently
address the cost of each iteration. In this paper, we introduce a learned
optimization framework that jointly tackles iteration count and per-iteration
complexity. Our approach is based on unfolding a fixed number of optimization
steps, replacing selected iterations with low-complexity approximated
computations, and learning extended hyperparameters from data to compensate for
the introduced approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on two representative problems: (i) hybrid beamforming; and (ii) robust
principal component analysis. These fundamental case studies show that our
learned approximated optimizers can achieve state-of-the-art performance while
reducing computational complexity by over three orders of magnitude. Our
results highlight the potential of our approach to enable rapid, interpretable,
and efficient decision-making in real-time systems.

Conclusion: 轻量级编码器在超导环境中具有可行性，但需进一步优化以适应实际约束。

Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting electronic circuits, such as single
flux quantum (SFQ) logic, to room-temperature electronics is susceptible to bit
errors, which may result from flux trapping, fabrication defects, and process
parameter variations (PPV). Due to the cooling power budget at 4.2 K and
constraints on the chip area, the size of the error-correction code encoders is
limited. In this work, three lightweight error-correction code encoders are
proposed that are based on Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3)
codes and implemented with SFQ logic. The performance of these encoders is
analyzed in the presence of PPV. The trade-offs between the theoretical
complexity and physical size of error-correction code encoders are identified.

Abstract: We address the modeling and optimal beamforming (BF) design for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems
operating over doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. First, a comprehensive DD
continuous MIMO (DDC MIMO) channel model that incorporates CAPAs at both the
transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) is derived, which is used to obtain explicit
input-output (I/O) relations for various waveforms well suited to integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) and robust to DD channels, namely orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS),
and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Then, functional
optimization problems are formulated for the design of TX and RX BF matrices
that maximize received power, in which novel low-complexity, closed-form
solutions are obtained via the calculus of variations (CoV) method, yielding
expressions closely related to the classical matched filter commonly used in
conventional MIMO systems. Simulation results confirm that the proposed TX/RX
BF designs with CAPAs provide significant performance and computational
complexity gains over conventional MIMO systems in DD channels.

Result: 实验表明该方法在少量训练数据下，也能很好地泛化到未见过的数据集。

Conclusion: 轻量级网络设计有效降低了计算复杂度，同时保持了高精度重建能力。

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) is a powerful tool in structural biology
for 3D visualization of cells and biological systems at resolutions sufficient
to identify individual proteins in situ. The measurements are collected by
tilting the frozen specimen and exposing it to an electron beam of known
dosage. As the biological samples are prone to electron damage, the samples can
be exposed to only a limited dosage of electrons, leading to noisy and
incomplete measurements. Thus, the reconstructions are noisy and incomplete,
leading to the missing wedge problem. Currently, self-supervised learning is
used to compensate for this issue. This typically involves, for each volume to
recover, training a large 3D UNet on the initial noisy reconstruction, leading
to large training time and memory requirements. In this work, we exploit the
local nature of the forward model to train a lightweight network using only
localized data from the measurements. This design provides flexibility in
balancing computational and time requirements while reconstructing the volumes
with high accuracy. We observe experimentally that this network can work well
on unseen datasets, despite using a network trained on a few measurements.

Result: 实验表明，模型成功解耦宽带复用光谱，改善了多光谱光场图像重建。

Conclusion: 该方法为光场成像的进一步发展提供了支持。

Abstract: Snapshot Multispectral Light-field Imaging (SMLI) is an emerging
computational imaging technique that captures high-dimensional data (x, y, z,
$\theta$, $\phi$, $\lambda$) in a single shot using a low-dimensional sensor.
The accuracy of high-dimensional data reconstruction depends on representing
the spectrum using neural radiance field models, which requires consideration
of broadband spectral decoupling during optimization. Currently, some SMLI
approaches avoid the challenge of model decoupling by either reducing
light-throughput or prolonging imaging time. In this work, we propose a
broadband spectral neural radiance field (BSNeRF) for SMLI systems. Experiments
show that our model successfully decouples a broadband multiplexed spectrum.
Consequently, this approach enhances multispectral light-field image
reconstruction and further advances plenoptic imaging.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够更准确地捕捉非高斯信道特性，显著提升估计性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate cascaded channel estimation for reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave multi-user communication
systems. Since the complex channel gains of the cascaded RIS channel are
generally non-Gaussian, the use of the linear minimum mean squared error
(LMMSE) estimator leads to inevitable performance degradation. To tackle this
issue, we propose a variational inference-based framework that approximates the
complex channel gains using a complex adaptive Laplace prior, which effectively
captures their probability distributions in a tractable way. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms conventional estimators
including least squares and LMMSE in terms of cascaded channel estimation
error.

Abstract: This study seeks to utilize large language models (LLMs) to forecast the

preprocessing, input embedding, and output projection modules to effectively
bridge the disparities between the wireless communication data and the data
format utilized by the pre-trained LLM. Simulation results demonstrate that our
model exhibits superior predictive performance under different numbers of base
station (BS) antennas and varying UE speeds, indicating strong generalization
and robustness ability. Furthermore, the spectral efficiency (SE) attained by
our model surpasses that achieved by traditional methods in both medium and

Conclusion: 论文探讨了生成式人工智能（GAI）在多域信道外推中的潜力与挑战，并提出了一些开放性问题，如可解释性、泛化能力和数据集收集。

Abstract: Channel extrapolation has attracted wide attention due to its potential to
acquire channel state information (CSI) with high accuracy and minimal
overhead. This is becoming increasingly crucial as the sixth-generation (6G)
mobile networks aim to support complex scenarios, for example, high-mobility
communications utilizing ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
technologies and broad spectrum bands, necessitating multi-domain channel
extrapolation. Current research predominantly addresses channel extrapolation
within a single domain, lacking a comprehensive approach to multi-domain
channel extrapolation. To bridge the gap, we propose the concept of
multi-domain channel extrapolation, detailing the essential performance
requirements for 6G networks. These include precise channel extrapolation,
adaptability to varying scenarios, and manageable computational complexity
during both training and inference stages. In light of these requirements, we
elaborate the potential and challenges of incorporating generative artificial
intelligence (GAI)-based models for effective multi-domain channel
extrapolation. Given the ability of the Transformer to capture long-range
dependencies and hidden patterns, we propose a novel Transformer encoder-like
model by eliminating the positional encoding module and replacing the original
multi-head attention with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for multi-domain
channel extrapolation. Simulation results indicate that this model surpasses
existing baseline models in terms of extrapolation accuracy and inference
speed. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the module
design of the proposed design. Finally, we pose several open questions for the
development of practical GAI-based multi-domain channel extrapolation models,
including the issues of explainability, generalization, and dataset collection.

Method: 提出了一种基于耦合Brown-Néel旋转模型的MNP信号模拟字典生成方法，并结合非模型动力学因素，通过迭代算法估计权重和传递函数。

Result: 算法在SNR 1和10下对合成信号验证准确，实际MPS实验中在0.89-15.33 mPa.s粘度范围内成功预测信号，NRMSE低于1.51%和3.5%，NWD值低（<0.10和<0.07）。

Conclusion: 该算法能够准确预测MNP信号，减少实验优化需求，适用于不同驱动场和粘度条件下的MPI应用。

Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tracer-based medical imaging modality
that enables quantification and spatial mapping of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)
distribution. The magnetization response of MNPs depends on experimental
conditions such as drive field (DF) settings and medium viscosity, as well as
on magnetic parameters of MNPs such as magnetic core diameter, hydrodynamic
diameter, and magnetic anisotropy constant. A comprehensive understanding of
the magnetization response of MNPs can facilitate the optimization of DF and
MNP type for a given MPI application, without the need for extensive
experimentation. In this work, we propose a calibration-free iterative
algorithm using model-based dictionaries for MNP signal prediction at untested
settings. Dictionaries were constructed with the MNP signals simulated using
the coupled Brown-N\'eel rotation model. Based on the available measurements,
the proposed algorithm jointly estimates the dictionary weights and the
transfer functions due to non-model-based dynamics. These dynamics include the
system response of the measurement setup as well as magnetization dynamics not
accounted for by the employed coupled Brown-N\'eel rotation model. The
algorithm was first validated on synthetic signals at SNR levels of 1 and 10,
and then tested on an in-house MPS setup across six viscosity levels
(0.89-15.33 mPa.s) and DF frequencies of 0.25-2 kHz using two commercial MNPs.
Validation on synthetic signals showed accurate weight and transfer function
estimation even at SNR 1. MPS experiments demonstrated successful prediction of
MNP signals at untested viscosities, with NRMSE below 1.51% and 3.5% for the
two tested MNPs across all DF settings. Predicted signals captured viscosity
dependent trends, and NWD values remained low (<0.10 and <0.07 for the two
tested MNPs), confirming robust weight estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise, outliers, sudden load changes, and bad measurement data
are key factors that diminish the accuracy of dynamic state estimation in power
systems. Additionally, unscented Kalman filters (UKF) based on correntropy
criteria utilize bandwidth-sensitive Gaussian kernels, which may lead to
singular matrices in the Cholesky decomposition. To overcome all the above
problems, in this paper, a robust UKF based on Cauchy kernel maximum mixture
correntropy (CKMMC) criteria over hybrid Beluga Whale-Bat (BWB) optimization
(BWB-CKMMC-UKF) is proposed, in which the kernel is merged of two Cauchy
functions. Specifically, the measurement error and state error are unified in
the cost function by the statistical linearization technique, and the optimal
value of state estimation is obtained by fixed-point iteration. Because of its
insensitive feature to kernel bandwidth and notable thick-tailed feature, the
Cauchy kernel function is utilized instead of the Gaussian kernel in the
optimization criteria. Additionally, to fit the power system model, the shape
coefficients of the kernel in the CKMMC criterion and scale coefficients that
influence the selection of sigma points in the unscented transform are
determined based on the BWB algorithm. Simulation results on IEEE 14, 30, and
57-bus test systems validated the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Cryo-ET allows to generate tomograms of biological samples in situ, capturing
complex structures in their native context. Despite low signal-to-noise ratio
in reconstructed volumes, the large number of copies of the same macromolecules
makes it possible to retrieve high-resolution maps by averaging many aligned
subtomograms. To keep up with technical advances in the imaging process and the
resulting huge amounts of data available, there is a need for scalable, fast
and robust procedures to align subtomograms. We propose a subtomogram alignment
framework based on the ball harmonics expansion that combines frequency- and
gradient-based optimization strategies to avoid exhaustive rotation sampling,
enabling a speed-up of an order of magnitude compared to current approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel ultrasonic array system designed for
high-precision localization using a large-scale MIMO (Multiple-Input

separability and spatial resolution. Each transmitter is excited by a
random-phase multisine within the ultrasonic band, which reduces inter-channel
correlation and increases robustness against multipath. The feasibility of the
approach is demonstrated through simulations of reflector imaging and analysis
of channel separation under realistic transducer bandwidth constraints. Results
show that MIMO processing enables improved separation of reflectors compared to
single-emitter configurations, although practical limitations such as

Abstract: This work studies an ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC)
downlink system using pinching antennas which are realized by activating small
dielectric particles along a dielectric waveguide. Our goal is to maximize the
data rate by optimizing the positions of the pinching antennas. By proposing a
compact and cost-efficient antenna architecture and formulating a finite
blocklength-based optimization model, we derive a closed-form solution for the
optimal antenna placement under quality-of-service (QoS) and antenna spacing
constraints. Meanwhile, a phase-alignment strategy is integrated into the
design, enabling coherent signal superposition across the array. Simulation
results confirm significant rate improvements over conventional antenna systems
while satisfying uRLLC requirements, making the proposed design well-suited for
compact and latency-critical future applications.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在均方误差（MSE）方面表现良好，且接近Cramér-Rao下界（CRLB）。

Conclusion: 提出的RBL方法在性能上具有优越性，能够有效利用有限信息实现高精度定位。

Abstract: We consider a novel rigid body localization (RBL) method, based only on a set
of measurements of the distances, as well as the angles between sensors of the
vehicle to the anchor landmark points. A key point of the proposed method is to
use a variation of the super multidimensional scaling (SMDS) algorithm, where
only a minor part of the complex edge kernel is used, based on the available
information, which in the case of RBL is anchor-to-anchor and target-to-target
information. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the proposed
technique in terms of mean square error (MSE) of the estimates, compared also
to the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB).

Motivation: 探讨不同损失函数（监督和无监督）对深度展开网络性能的影响，以优化稀疏信号恢复。

Method: 通过深度展开的ISTA和IHT算法，比较监督学习的均方误差损失和无监督学习的原始优化目标函数。

Result: 损失函数的效果取决于问题的凸性：凸问题中监督学习更准但无法最小化原始目标，非凸问题中两种学习表现相似且优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究为设计高效的深度展开网络提供了重要见解，特别是在稀疏信号恢复应用中。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of loss function selection in deep
unfolding techniques for sparse signal recovery algorithms. Deep unfolding
transforms iterative optimization algorithms into trainable lightweight neural
networks by unfolding their iterations as network layers, with various loss
functions employed for parameter learning depending on application contexts. We
focus on deep unfolded versions of the fundamental iterative shrinkage
thresholding algorithm (ISTA) and the iterative hard thresholding algorithm
(IHT), comparing supervised learning using mean squared error with unsupervised
learning using the objective function of the original optimization problem. Our
simulation results reveal that the effect of the choice of loss function
significantly depends on the convexity of the optimization problem. For convex
$\ell_1$-regularized problems, supervised-ISTA achieves better final recovery
accuracy but fails to minimize the original objective function, whereas we
empirically observe that unsupervised-ISTA converges to a nearly identical
solution as conventional ISTA but with accelerated convergence. Conversely, for
nonconvex $\ell_0$-regularized problems, both supervised-IHT and
unsupervised-IHT converge to better local minima than the original IHT, showing
similar performance regardless of the loss function employed. These findings
provide valuable insights into the design of effective deep unfolded networks
for sparse signal recovery applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm named JS-gOMP, which enhances
the generalized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (gOMP) algorithm for improved noise
robustness in sparse signal processing. The JS-gOMP algorithm uniquely
incorporates the James-Stein estimator, optimizing the trade-off between signal
recovery and noise suppression. This modification addresses the challenges
posed by noise in the dictionary, a common issue in sparse representation
scenarios. Comparative analyses demonstrate that JS-gOMP outperforms
traditional gOMP, especially in noisy environments, offering a more effective
solution for signal and image processing applications where noise presence is
significant.

Conclusion: 研究为未来6G非地面网络的频谱共享设计和监管提供了新的见解和权衡考量。

Abstract: The increasing number of satellite deployments, both in the low and
geostationary Earth orbit exacerbates the already ongoing scarcity of wireless
resources when targeting ubiquitous connectivity. For the aim of supporting a
massive number of IoT devices characterized by bursty traffic and modern
variants of random access, we pose the following question: Should competing
satellite operators share spectrum resources or is an exclusive allocation
preferable? This question is addressed by devising a communication model for
two operators which serve overlapping coverage areas with independent IoT
services. Analytical approximations, validated by Monte Carlo simulations,
reveal that spectrum sharing can yield significant throughput gains for both
operators under certain conditions tied to the relative serviced user
populations and coding rates in use. These gains are sensitive also to the
system parameters and may not always render the spectral coexistence mutually
advantageous. Our model captures basic trade-offs in uplink spectrum sharing
and provides novel actionable insights for the design and regulation of future
6G non-terrestrial networks.

Conclusion: 非同一扩散模型能更准确地捕捉局部误差，适用于无线MIMO-OFDM信道生成，提升了生成结果的可靠性。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion model, termed the non-identical diffusion model,
and investigate its application to wireless orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) channel generation. Unlike the standard diffusion model
that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we
extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error
variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize
the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy
input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is
biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates
exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme.
Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to
capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a
matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression.
Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the
correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme
both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we
propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate
multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical
experiments.

Conclusion: 预测性通信范式通过分层优化有效解决了低空网络的动态和干扰问题，展现了巨大潜力。

Abstract: The emergence of dense, mission-driven aerial networks supporting the
low-altitude economy presents unique communication challenges, including
extreme channel dynamics and severe cross-tier interference. Traditional
reactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they
fail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces
predictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from
reactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by
fusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio
environment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical
framework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation
problem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and
operational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the
accuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate
that this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction
in cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable
low-altitude communication systems.

Abstract: Proximity-based interference is a growing threat to satellite communications,
driven by dense multi-orbit constellations and increasingly agile adversarial
maneuvers. We propose a hybrid simulation framework that integrates orbital
maneuver modeling with RF signal degradation analysis to detect and classify
suspicious proximity operations. Using the open-source Maneuver Detection Data
Generation (MaDDG) library from MIT Lincoln Laboratory, we generate labeled
datasets combining impulsive maneuver profiles with radio-frequency (RF)
impacts across a range of behavioral intents: routine station-keeping, covert
shadowing, and overt jamming. Our approach fuses kinematic features such as
range, velocity, acceleration, and Time of Closest Approach (TCA), with RF
metrics including Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), throughput, and
Jammer-to-Signal Ratio (JSR). These features are further enhanced with temporal
derivatives and rolling-window statistics to capture subtle or transient
interference patterns. A Random Forest classifier trained on this fused feature
set achieves 94.67% accuracy and a macro F1 score of 0.9471, outperforming
models using only kinematic or RF inputs. The system is particularly effective
in detecting covert threats, such as surveillance or intermittent jamming, that
evade RF-only methods.

Abstract: Accurate and timely water level monitoring is critical for flood prevention,
environmental management, and emerging smart infrastructure systems.
Traditional water sensing methods often rely on dedicated sensors, which can be
costly to deploy and difficult to maintain and are vulnerable to damage during
floods.In this work, we propose a novel cellular signalbased sensing scheme
that passively estimates water level changes using downlink mobile signals from
existing communication infrastructure. By capturing subtle variations in
channel state information (CSI), the proposed method estimates the length
changes of the water-reflected signal path, which correspond to water level
variations. A space-time processing framework is developed to jointly estimate
the angle of arrival and Doppler shift, enabling isolation and enhancement of
the water-reflected path via beamforming, while effectively suppressing
environmental noise. The phase evolution of the beamformed signal is then
extracted to infer water level changes. To address clock asynchronism between
the transmitter and receiver inherent in bistatic systems, we introduce a
beamforming-based compensation technique for removing time-varying random phase
offsets in CSI. Field experiments conducted across a river demonstrate that the
proposed method enables accurate and reliable water level estimation, achieving
a mean accuracy ranging from 1.5 cm to 3.05 cm across different receiver
configurations and deployments.

Abstract: Stress has emerged as a critical global health issue, contributing to
cardiovascular disorders, depression, and several other long-term illnesses.
Consequently, accurate and reliable stress monitoring systems are of growing
importance. In this work, we propose a stress prediction framework based on
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded during multiple daily activities such
as sitting, walking, and jogging. Frequency-domain indicators of autonomic
nervous system activity were obtained through Power Spectral Density (PSD)
analysis and utilized as input for machine learning models including Decision
Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, deep
learning approaches, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were directly applied to the raw ECG
signals. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of ensemble-based
classifiers, with CatBoost achieving 90% accuracy. Moreover, the LSTM model
provided superior results, attaining 94% accuracy with balanced precision,
recall, and F1-score, reflecting its strength in modeling temporal dependencies
in ECG data. Overall, the findings suggest that integrating frequency-domain
feature extraction with advanced learning algorithms enhances stress prediction
and paves the way for real-time healthcare monitoring solutions.

Abstract: This work investigates the covertness and security performance of
Internet-of-Things (IoTs) networks under Rayleigh fading environments.
Specifically, a cellular source transmits covert information to cell-edge users
with the assistance of an IoT master node, employing a coordinated direct and
relay transmission strategy combined with non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA). This approach not only enhances spectrum utilization but also generates
friendly interference to complicate a warden's surveillance or an
eavesdropper's decoding efforts. From a covertness perspective, we derive exact
closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) under
arbitrary judgment thresholds. We then identify the optimal judgment threshold
for the worst-case scenario, at which the warden minimizes its DEP performance.
Accordingly, we determine the effective region for user power allocation (PA)
in NOMA transmission that satisfies the DEP constraint. From a security
perspective, we derive analytical expressions for the secrecy outage
probability under two eavesdropping strategies using selection combining and
maximal ratio combining. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive PA
scheme that maximizes covert rate while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS)
requirements of legitimate users, the system's minimum covertness requirements,
and supporting successive interference cancellation (SIC) procedures.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive PA scheme that maximizes the secrecy rate
while ensuring the QoS requirements of legitimate users and SIC conditions.
Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the analytical framework, while
the proposed optimization strategies effectively adjust PA coefficients to
maximize either the covert rate or the secrecy rate.

Conclusion: 气象因素（尤其是温度和湿度）可用于预测和校正时间ASF，提高MF R-Mode的定位精度。

Abstract: As the vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have
become more widely recognized, the need for complementary navigation systems
has grown. Medium frequency ranging mode (MF R-Mode) has gained attention as an
effective backup system during GNSS outages, owing to its strong signal
strength and cost-effective scalability. However, to achieve accurate
positioning, MF R-Mode requires correction for the additional secondary factor
(ASF), a propagation delay affected by terrain. The temporal variation of ASF,
known as temporal ASF, is typically corrected using reference stations;
however, the effectiveness of this method decreases with distance from the
reference station. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between temporal
ASF and meteorological factors to evaluate the feasibility of predicting
temporal ASF based on meteorological factors. Among these factors, temperature
and humidity showed significant correlations with temporal ASF, suggesting
their potential utility in ASF correction.

Abstract: The synergy between integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) unlocks novel applications and
advanced services for next-generation wireless networks, yet also introduces
new security challenges. In this study, a novel dual target-mounted
RISs-assisted ISAC scheme is proposed, where a base station with ISAC
capability performs sensing of two unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) targets, one
of which is legitimate and the other is eavesdropper, while communicating with
the users through an RIS mounted on the legitimate UAV target. The proposed
scheme addresses dual security threats posed by a hostile UAV target:
eavesdropping on legitimate user communications and random interference attacks
launched by a malicious RIS mounted on this eavesdropper UAV target, aiming to
disrupt secure transmissions. A non-convex optimization problem maximizing the
secrecy rate of the users is formulated, and a semi-definite relaxation
(SDR)-based two-stage solution is developed to optimize the transmit
beamforming matrix of the base station and the phase shift coefficients of the
legitimate RIS. Extensive computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the
robustness of the proposed solution under various system configurations. The
proposed system's communication performance is assessed using the secrecy rate
metric, while the sensing performance is evaluated through the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for
angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation of the eavesdropper UAV target.

Abstract: To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic
scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical
challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has
demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel
conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works
have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the
discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the
limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP
tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this
paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system
for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural
properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel
properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables
efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results
have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves
average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while
maintaining identical communication overhead.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) at terahertz (THz) frequencies
holds significant promise for unifying ultra-high-speed wireless connectivity
with fine-grained environmental awareness. Realistic and interpretable channel
modeling is essential to fully realize the potential of such systems. This work
presents a comprehensive investigation of monostatic sensing channels at
300~GHz, based on an extensive measurement campaign conducted at 57 co-located
transceiver (TRx) positions across three representative indoor scenarios.
Multipath component (MPC) parameters, including amplitude, delay, and angle,
are extracted using a high-resolution space-alternating generalized
expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. To cluster the extracted MPCs, an
image-processing-based clustering method, i.e., connected component labeling
(CCL), is applied to group MPCs based on delay-angle consistency. Based on the
measurement data, an environment-aware channel modeling framework is proposed
to establish mappings between physical scenario attributes (e.g., reflector
geometry, surface materials, and roughness) and their corresponding
channel-domain manifestations. The framework incorporates both specular and
diffuse reflections and leverages several channel parameters, e.g., reflection
loss, Lambertian scattering, and intra-cluster dispersion models, to
characterize reflection behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach can reliably extract physical characteristics, e.g.,
structural and material information, from the observed channel characteristics,
offering a promising foundation for advanced THz ISAC channel modeling.

candidate integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) waveform owing to its
superior communication performance, outperforming the Orthogonal Time-Frequency
Space (OTFS) that has been researched for a longer time. However, since the
above two waveforms are incompatible with each other, the state-of-the-art
methods well-designed for OTFS may not be directly applicable to AFDM. This
paper introduces a new orthogonal multicarrier waveform, namely Affine-Doppler
Division Multiplexing (ADDM), which can provide a generic framework and subsume
the existing OTFS and AFDM as a particular case. ADDM modulating information
symbols in the Affine-Doppler (A-D) domain based on a two-dimensional (2D)
transform can enjoy both excellent unambiguous Doppler and Doppler resolution,
which is the same as AFDM but outperforms OTFS. Moreover, benefiting from the
2D transform, the symbols block of ADDM in the A-D domain undergoes a 2D cyclic
shift produced by the delay and the Doppler of the channel, similar to the 2D
cyclic shift in the delay-Doppler domain of cyclic prefix (CP)-OTFS. This
offers a potential to directly apply the state-of-the-art methods well-designed
for OTFS and AFDM to ADDM. Numerical results show that ADDM achieves comparable
BER performance with AFDM but outperforms OTFS in high-mobility scenarios.

Motivation: 解决双基地配置中传感参数的高分辨率估计挑战，提升集成感知与通信系统的效率。

Method: IFFT-C2VNN使用复值卷积神经网络降低计算复杂度；PARAMING利用系统模型知识精确提取参数。

Result: 两种算法在不同信噪比下均表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel algorithms designed to address the challenge
of super-resolution sensing parameter estimation in bistatic configurations
within communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
systems. Our approach leverages the estimated channel state information derived
from reference symbols originally intended for communication to achieve
super-resolution sensing parameter estimation. The first algorithm, IFFT-C2VNN,
employs complex-valued convolutional neural networks to estimate the parameters
of different targets, achieving significant reductions in computational
complexity compared to traditional methods. The second algorithm, PARAMING,
utilizes a parametric method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the system
model, including the transmit and receive array geometries, to extract the
sensing parameters accurately. Through a comprehensive performance analysis, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both algorithms across a range
of signal-to-noise ratios, underscoring their applicability in realistic ISAC
scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对多接收天线用户的捏制天线系统（PAS）建模框架，通过优化辐射点位置和启发式压缩放置算法，显著提升信号性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代网络需要智能且稳健的信道条件支持超高数据速率和无缝连接。传统天线技术适应性有限，无法有效恢复视距链路，PAS为此提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 提出一个两层的放置策略：首先优化中心辐射点，随后使用启发式压缩放置算法选择紧凑的活跃天线集合。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该系统在短距离场景中，尤其是密集PA和宽间距用户天线情况下，性能显著优于传统单天线方案。

Conclusion: PAS在多接收天线用户场景中表现出色，为动态环境下的通信提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Next-generation networks require intelligent and robust channel conditions to
support ultra-high data rates, seamless connectivity, and large-scale device
deployments in dynamic environments. While flexible antenna technologies such
as fluid and movable antennas offer some degree of adaptability, their limited
reconfiguration range and structural rigidity reduce their effectiveness in
restoring line-of-sight (LoS) links. As a complementary solution, pinching
antenna systems (PASs) enable fine-grained, hardware-free control of radiation
locations along a waveguide, offering enhanced flexibility in challenging
propagation environments, especially under non-LoS (NLoS) conditions. This
paper introduces a general and novel modeling framework for downlink PASs
targeting users equipped with multiple receive antennas, addressing a practical
yet underexplored scenario in the existing literature. Specifically, we first
derive an analytical relationship between the received signal-to-noise ratio
and the pinching antenna (PA) positions, and based on this, we propose a
two-layer placement strategy. First, we optimize the central radiation point
using large-scale channel characteristics, and then we use a heuristic
compressed placement algorithm to approximate phase alignment across multiple
receive antennas and select a spatially compact set of active elements.
Simulation results demonstrate notable performance gains over conventional
single-antenna schemes, particularly in short-range scenarios with dense PAs
and widely spaced user antennas.

Method: 提出FAS辅助的异构双层传输架构，结合FPA和FAS，通过分数规划-块坐标下降算法优化发射预编码器、接收组合器和天线位置。

Result: FAS在相同功率约束下比FPA提高56%的数据速率，且天线位置优化能显著增强信号质量并抑制干扰。

Conclusion: FAS架构在低空通信中表现出优越性能，为干扰环境下的高效传输提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of co-channel interference and intentional
jamming in low-altitude air-ground communications. Since conventional
fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems lack spatial adaptability to dynamically
balance signal enhancement against interference suppression, we propose a
transformative fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted heterogeneous dual-layer
transmission architecture. Specifically, a terrestrial base station with FPA
serves ground users, while a low altitude-serving base station equipped with
FAS communicates with the aerial user, also equipped with FAS, under the attack
of a malicious jammer. We formulate a worst-case achievable rate maximization
problem for aerial user subject to constraints including quality-of-service for
terrestrial users, imperfect jamming directions, minimum antenna separation,
etc. To address the non-convex problem, we propose a fractional
programming-block coordinate descent algorithm that alternately optimizes the
transmit precoders, receive combiner, and antenna positions at both transceiver
sides. Convex hull-based approach and geometric boundary method are used to
handle the jamming uncertainty and antenna placement constraints in confined
spatial regions, respectively. Extensive simulations validate significant
performance gains. The FAS achieves up to 56\% higher data rates than FPA under
equivalent power constraints. Strategic antenna repositioning demonstrably
enhances signal quality while suppressing interference, maintaining robustness
across diverse jammer channel uncertainties.

Abstract: The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique has been considered
a key enabler for 6G radio access networks. ISAC fulfills a brand new paradigm
shift in wireless networks via the seamless interplay between communication and
sensing within a unified network. However, the tight integration of these
functionalities inevitably gives rise to various types of interference, posing
significant challenges to existing ISAC waveform designs and rendering
interference management a critical concern. Inspired by the development
trajectory of wireless communications, different multiple access (MA)
techniques, such as orthogonal multiple access (OMA), space-division multiple
access (SDMA), and more recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and
rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), have been demonstrated to play a pivotal
role in efficiently utilizing limited spectrum resources, designing ISAC
waveforms, as well as managing inter-user interference and inter-functionality
interference in ISAC. Notably, the interplay between MA and ISAC presents
mutually beneficial integration. On the one hand, ISAC helps MA techniques
better exploit their interference management capability beyond the
communication-only networks. On the other hand, different MA techniques serve
as promising solutions for inter-functionality and inter-user interference
management in ISAC. In this paper, we deliver the first comprehensive tutorial
of MA techniques in ISAC networks. Specifically, we illustrate the fundamental
principles of ISAC, classify the diverse types of interference in different
ISAC systems, and compare MA-assisted ISAC designs, highlighting their
respective advantages and limitations. Moreover, we provide an outlook on the
emerging applications and future research directions of different MA-assisted
ISAC.

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义增强且可解释的V2X系统（SEE-V2X），通过智能摄像头提供上下文感知的警告信息，帮助驾驶员做出更智能的决策，从而提高交通效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统V2X系统中，路边单元（RSUs）广播的警告信息缺乏上下文，导致驾驶员过度谨慎或驾驶行为低效。

Method: 在SEE-V2X系统中，RSUs配备智能摄像头检测障碍物，并传输上下文感知的信息，同时提供可视化功能帮助驾驶员看清隐藏的行人。

Result: 实际演示和模拟结果显示，SEE-V2X显著提高了交通效率，减少了不必要的减速。

Conclusion: SEE-V2X通过提供上下文感知和可视化功能，优化了驾驶决策，提升了交通系统的整体效率。

Abstract: In current vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, roadside units
(RSUs) broadcast brief warning messages that alert nearby vehicles to avoid
potential hazards. However, these messages lack contextual information on why a
warning is issued, leading to excessive caution or inefficient driving
behaviors. To avoid such a situation, we propose a semantic-enhanced and
explainable V2X (SEE-V2X) system. In the proposed system, RSUs equipped with
smart cameras detect obstructions and transmit context-aware messages to
vehicles. By understanding both what the hazard is and why it occurs, drivers
can make more intelligent decisions based on their specific driving situation.
Furthermore, through a real-field demonstration, we show the new "see-through"
feature in the proposed system, which enables drivers to visualize hidden
pedestrians behind obstacles. We also perform simulations to compare
traditional V2X with SEE-V2X under different traffic conditions. The results
show that SEE-V2X significantly improves traffic efficiency and reduces
unnecessary deceleration.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The space-air-ground-sea integrated networking (SAGSIN) concept promises
seamless global multimedia connectivity, yet two obstacles still limit its
practical deployment. Firstly, high-velocity satellites, aerial relays and
sea-surface platforms suffer from obsolete channel state information (CSI),
undermining feedback-based adaptation. Secondly, data-rate disparity across the
protocol stack is extreme: terabit optical links in space coexist with kilobit
acoustic under-water links. This article shows that a single large language
model (LLM) backbone, trained jointly on radio, optical and acoustic traces,
can provide a unified, data-driven adaptation layer that addresses both rapid
CSI ageing and severe bandwidth disparity across the SAGSIN protocol stack.
Explicitly, an LLM-based long-range channel predictor forecasts the strongest
delay-Doppler components several coherence intervals ahead, facilitating
near-capacity reception despite violent channel fluctuations. Furthermore, our
LLM-based semantic encoder turns raw sensor payloads into task-oriented tokens.
This substantially reduces the SNR required for high-fidelity image delivery in
a coastal underwater link, circumventing the data rate limitation by semantic
communications. Inclusion of these tools creates a medium-agnostic adaptation
layer that spans radio, optical and acoustic channels. We conclude with
promising open research directions in on-device model compression, multimodal
fidelity control, cross-layer resource orchestration and trustworthy operation,
charting a path from laboratory prototypes to field deployment.

Conclusion: IOG框架有效提升了机器人在火灾场景中的智能感知与响应能力。

Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can
significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying
emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human
responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and
disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete
perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To
enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire
scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire
prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency
response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph
(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs
from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide
interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component
configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and
real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical
application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.

Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for
advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on
specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world
deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks,
requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and
adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first
large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first
scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop
verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous
collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120
hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames.
This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and
airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the
customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes,
and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to
collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify
algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for
wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models.

Abstract: This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real
learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike
traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points
with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation
function space and a confidence map -- both parameterized by a neural network
-- to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the
sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as
point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker
points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be
seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for
inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and
adaptability of our method on both vision devices and across four pneumatically
actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft
manipulators.

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

Conclusion: 建议采用VCHIP-ME方法，并投资高频AVL数据收集以提升分析质量。

Abstract: Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics,
but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies,
necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory
reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using
high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four
critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on
reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of
these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the
trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework
combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity
with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning
velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed
variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each
method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our
findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform
position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based
methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban
environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity
constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME)
yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both
historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant
predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer
practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory
reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in
higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.

Motivation: 在动态机器人任务中，机器人需识别对象的物理属性才能成功执行任务，且无法自主恢复失败。传统方法效率低或成功率不足。

Method: 采用任务信息探索策略，结合不确定性机制决定探索与任务执行的过渡时机，确保属性估计准确性并最小化探索时间。

Conclusion: 任务信息奖励能有效捕捉物理属性的重要性，提升任务执行效率，适用于实际机器人设置。

Abstract: In many dynamic robotic tasks, such as striking pucks into a goal outside the
reachable workspace, the robot must first identify the relevant physical
properties of the object for successful task execution, as it is unable to
recover from failure or retry without human intervention. To address this
challenge, we propose a task-informed exploration approach, based on
reinforcement learning, that trains an exploration policy using rewards
automatically generated from the sensitivity of a privileged task policy to
errors in estimated properties. We also introduce an uncertainty-based
mechanism to determine when to transition from exploration to task execution,
ensuring sufficient property estimation accuracy with minimal exploration time.
Our method achieves a 90% success rate on the striking task with an average
exploration time under 1.2 seconds, significantly outperforming baselines that
achieve at most 40% success or require inefficient querying and retraining in a
simulator at test time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our task-informed
rewards capture the relative importance of physical properties in both the
striking task and the classical CartPole example. Finally, we validate our
approach by demonstrating its ability to identify object properties and adjust
task execution in a physical setup using the KUKA iiwa robot arm.

Conclusion: 该方法结合了高效优化器的样本效率和标准方法的通用性，避免了其他一阶MBRL方法的不良行为。

Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that
leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While
early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared
to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical
due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can
approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver
efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,
which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples
trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled
using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a
learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables
efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator
gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation
rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and
speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality
of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other
first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark
control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HAVE的新型历史感知验证器，通过利用过去的交互来在线解决不确定场景。该方法在视觉模糊对象操作中表现优于生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在面对视觉模糊对象时的不确定性操作问题，生成模型在实际应用中表现不佳，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 将动作生成与验证分离，使用无条件扩散生成器提出候选动作，利用历史感知验证器选择最优动作。

Result: 理论分析和实证评估表明，该方法显著提高了动作质量，并在多种模拟和现实环境中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HAVE方法在解决视觉模糊场景中的机器人操作问题上是有效的，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce a novel History-Aware VErifier (HAVE) to disambiguate uncertain
scenarios online by leveraging past interactions. Robots frequently encounter
visually ambiguous objects whose manipulation outcomes remain uncertain until
physically interacted with. While generative models alone could theoretically
adapt to such ambiguity, in practice they obtain suboptimal performance in
ambiguous cases, even when conditioned on action history. To address this, we
propose explicitly decoupling action generation from verification: we use an
unconditional diffusion-based generator to propose multiple candidate actions
and employ our history-aware verifier to select the most promising action by
reasoning about past interactions. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that employing a verifier significantly improves expected action quality.
Empirical evaluations and analysis across multiple simulated and real-world
environments including articulated objects, multi-modal doors, and uneven
object pick-up confirm the effectiveness of our method and improvements over
baselines. Our project website is available at:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TReF-6的方法，通过单次轨迹推断出6DoF任务相关帧，结合视觉语言模型和Grounded-SAM实现任务意图的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人通常难以通过单次演示泛化任务，因为缺乏可转移和可解释的空间表示。

Method: 从轨迹几何中推断一个抽象的任务相关帧，结合视觉语言模型和Grounded-SAM进行语义和空间定位。

Result: 在仿真中验证了方法的鲁棒性，并在真实世界的操作任务中展示了泛化能力。

Conclusion: TReF-6支持单次模仿学习，能够跨多样对象配置保持任务意图。

Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the
lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work,
we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF
Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an
influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a
local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement
Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure,
extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The
inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and
localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent
skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate
robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on
real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation
learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间环境中机器人自主性面临高感知和运动不确定性、严格运动约束及有限人工干预机会的挑战，需要高效的TMP框架。

Method: 提出了TMP-EAOG框架，通过迭代扩展AND/OR图并结合实时运动规划评估，确保任务与运动规划的可行性。

Result: TMP-EAOG在基准测试中表现出对各类挑战的适应性，展现了鲁棒性、可控自主性和有界灵活性。

Conclusion: TMP-EAOG框架在复杂空间任务中展现了其高效性和适应性，为自主机器人任务规划提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including
high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and
limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion
Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or
even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete
action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In
this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,
referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different
scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,
which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop
motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,
TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a
certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate
for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled
autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)
bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of
unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative
paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We
use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous
robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of
challenges in the benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的接触辅助导航策略（CAN），用于柔性机器人内窥镜在动态胃部环境中的导航，显著提高了导航精度和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态胃部环境中导航柔性机器人内窥镜极具挑战，需有效利用与变形胃壁的接触力以到达目标位置。

Method: 使用基于物理的有限元方法模拟胃部环境，结合近端策略优化（PPO）算法训练DRL模型，利用接触力反馈提升导航性能。

Result: 在静态和动态胃部环境中，CAN策略实现100%成功率和1.6毫米平均误差；在更具挑战的未见过场景中保持85%成功率。

Conclusion: DRL-based CAN策略显著优于现有方法，验证了其在柔性机器人内窥镜导航中的高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal
tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in
the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to
effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target
locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact
force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The
training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method
(FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success
rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and
significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach
environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average
error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios
with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based
CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior
methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个框架，用于通过内部表示解释和引导VLA模型的行为，无需微调或额外信号，同时展示了在仿真和物理机器人上的零样本控制效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在机器人领域具有潜力，但其缺乏可解释性和稳健性，限制了实际应用。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过投影变换器层的激活到语义方向，识别与动作选择相关的稀疏语义方向，并引入实时激活引导方法。

Result: 在Pi0和OpenVLA模型上验证了方法的有效性，并在仿真和物理机器人（UR5）上实现了零样本行为控制。

Conclusion: 研究表明VLA模型的可解释组件可被系统性地用于控制，为机器人领域透明和可引导的基础模型建立了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing
generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and
environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far
short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of
kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a
central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where
robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in
mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first
framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal
representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference
time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the
token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed
and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these
findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that
modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or
environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source
VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in
simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that
interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for
control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation
models in robotics.

TL;DR: 本研究提出JEDP-RL框架，通过分阶段雅可比矩阵估计与策略执行解决了可变形连续体机器人的规划问题，在收敛速度、导航效率及泛化能力上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对可变形连续体机器人（DCRs）的非线性变形力学和部分状态可观测性，传统强化学习方法无法直接适用，需开发新的规划框架。

Method: 提出JEDP-RL框架，分两阶段进行：局部探索动作以估计变形雅可比矩阵，随后将雅可比特征融入状态表示以恢复近似马尔可夫性。

Result: 在仿真实验中，JEDP-RL比PPO基线方法收敛速度快3.2倍，导航步骤减少25%，且在材料属性变化和未知组织环境中泛化能力显著提高。

Conclusion: JEDP-RL通过分阶段雅可比估计有效解决了DCRs的规划问题，为实际应用提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to
nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the
Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While
Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators,
their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and
underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory
Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased
Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first
perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation
Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features
to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic
simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy
optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy
convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the
target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material
property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the
unseen tissue environment.

Abstract: Traditional aggregate sorting methods, whether manual or mechanical, often
suffer from low precision, limited flexibility, and poor adaptability to
diverse material properties such as size, shape, and lithology. To address
these limitations, this study presents a computer vision-aided robotic arm
system designed for autonomous aggregate sorting in construction and mining
applications. The system integrates a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, a
binocular stereo camera for 3D perception, and a ROS-based control framework.
Core techniques include an attention-augmented YOLOv8 model for aggregate
detection, stereo matching for 3D localization, Denavit-Hartenberg kinematic
modeling for arm motion control, minimum enclosing rectangle analysis for size
estimation, and hand-eye calibration for precise coordinate alignment.
Experimental validation with four aggregate types achieved an average grasping
and sorting success rate of 97.5%, with comparable classification accuracy.
Remaining challenges include the reliable handling of small aggregates and
texture-based misclassification. Overall, the proposed system demonstrates
significant potential to enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and
improve safety in aggregate handling, while providing a scalable framework for
advancing smart automation in construction, mining, and recycling industries.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires systems that can
generalize across diverse tasks while maintaining robust and reliable
performance. We introduce {GVF-TAPE}, a closed-loop framework that combines
generative visual foresight with task-agnostic pose estimation to enable
scalable robotic manipulation. GVF-TAPE employs a generative video model to
predict future RGB-D frames from a single side-view RGB image and a task
description, offering visual plans that guide robot actions. A decoupled pose
estimation model then extracts end-effector poses from the predicted frames,
translating them into executable commands via low-level controllers. By
iteratively integrating video foresight and pose estimation in a closed loop,
GVF-TAPE achieves real-time, adaptive manipulation across a broad range of
tasks. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach reduces reliance on task-specific action data and
generalizes effectively, providing a practical and scalable solution for
intelligent robotic systems.

Abstract: This thesis introduces "Embodied Spatial Intelligence" to address the

scene representation and spatial reasoning. For perception, we develop robust,
scalable, and accurate scene representations using implicit neural models, with
contributions in self-supervised camera calibration, high-fidelity depth field
generation, and large-scale reconstruction. For spatial reasoning, we enhance
the spatial capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel navigation benchmark, a
method for grounding language in 3D, and a state-feedback mechanism to improve
long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can
robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex,

Abstract: This paper presents two types of extended diffeomorphism designs to
compensate for spatial placement differences between robot workspaces.
Teleoperation of multiple robots is attracting attention to expand the
utilization of the robot embodiment. Real-time reproduction of robot motion
would facilitate the efficient execution of similar tasks by multiple robots. A
challenge in the motion reproduction is compensating for the spatial
arrangement errors of target keypoints in robot workspaces. This paper proposes
a methodology for smooth mappings that transform primary robot poses into
follower robot poses based on the predefined key points in each workspace.
Through a picking task experiment using a dual-arm UR5 robot, this study
demonstrates that the proposed mapping generation method can balance lower
mapping errors for precise operation and lower mapping gradients for smooth
replicated movement.

Abstract: The trajectory data of traffic participants (TPs) is a fundamental resource
for evaluating traffic conditions and optimizing policies, especially at urban

datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information
richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a
fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban
signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for
drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection
types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000
TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts
per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides
comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw
videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements
validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification

Abstract: Tissue biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing many diseases, involving
the extraction of diseased tissue for histopathology analysis by expert
pathologists. However, this procedure has two main limitations: 1) Manual

platform to overcome the limitations in traditional histopathology. Our
platform is capable of steering a variety of tools with different sizes,
including needle for tissue extraction and optical fibers for vibrational
spectroscopy applications. This system facilitates the guidance of end-effector
to the tissue and assists surgeons in navigating to the biopsy target area for
multi-modal diagnosis. In this paper, we outline the general concept of our
device, followed by a detailed description of its mechanical design and control
scheme. We conclude with the validation of the system through a series of
tests, including positioning accuracy, admittance performance, and tool

Abstract: ConceptBot is a modular robotic planning framework that combines Large
Language Models and Knowledge Graphs to generate feasible and risk-aware plans
despite ambiguities in natural language instructions and correctly analyzing
the objects present in the environment - challenges that typically arise from a
lack of commonsense reasoning. To do that, ConceptBot integrates (i) an Object

semantic concepts from ConceptNet, (ii) a User Request Processing (URP) module
that disambiguates and structures instructions, and (iii) a Planner that
generates context-aware, feasible pick-and-place policies. In comparative
evaluations against Google SayCan, ConceptBot achieved 100% success on explicit
tasks, maintained 87% accuracy on implicit tasks (versus 31% for SayCan),
reached 76% on risk-aware tasks (versus 15%), and outperformed SayCan in
application-specific scenarios, including material classification (70% vs. 20%)
and toxicity detection (86% vs. 36%). On SafeAgentBench, ConceptBot achieved an
overall score of 80% (versus 46% for the next-best baseline). These results,

### [77] [Gray-Box Computed Torque Control for Differential-Drive Mobile Robot Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00571)
*Arman Javan Sekhavat Pishkhani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种结合CTC和DRL的学习型非线性算法，用于改进差速移动机器人的跟踪控制，提高了样本效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTM对系统参数不准确敏感，而DRL算法样本效率低且稳定性差，需要改进。

Method: 用灰盒CTC替代DRL的黑盒策略网络，结合TD3算法优化控制器参数，确保物理合理性和临界阻尼响应。

Result: 在MuJoCo仿真中，该控制器表现优于原始CTC和传统运动控制器。

Conclusion: 该混合方法显著提升了样本效率和稳定性，适用于差速移动机器人的跟踪控制。

Abstract: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control
of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers
from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability
guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL
agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample
efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an
optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using
only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some
controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges,
ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also
applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The
controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot
simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a
conventional kinematic controller.

### [78] [Learning Dolly-In Filming From Demonstration Using a Ground-Based Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00574)
*Philip Lorimer,Alan Hunter,Wenbin Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了如何通过学习示范（LfD）和生成对抗模仿学习（GAIL）来实现机器人电影拍摄中更自然的相机控制，解决了传统强化学习中奖励函数难以设计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电影摄影需要平衡精确性和艺术性，但手工设计的奖励函数难以捕捉这种复杂的平衡。传统强化学习方法依赖定制奖励和大量调优，限制了其创意实用性。

Method: 作者提出了一种基于GAIL的LfD方法，通过模拟环境下的专家演示（使用操纵杆控制）来训练机器人，从而实现无需人工设计奖励的自动化相机控制。

Result: 在模拟环境中，GAIL策略优于基线PPO，奖励更高、收敛更快、方差更低，并且无需调优即可迁移到真实世界的机器人上，表现出更高的稳定性和一致性。

Conclusion: LfD提供了一种无需奖励的强化学习替代方案，为电影行业提供了一种更直观、高效的机器人相机控制方法，减少了技术障碍。

Abstract: Cinematic camera control demands a balance of precision and artistry -
qualities that are difficult to encode through handcrafted reward functions.
While reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to robotic filmmaking, its
reliance on bespoke rewards and extensive tuning limits creative usability. We
propose a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach using Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to automate dolly-in shots with a
free-roaming, ground-based filming robot. Expert trajectories are collected via
joystick teleoperation in simulation, capturing smooth, expressive motion
without explicit objective design.
  Trained exclusively on these demonstrations, our GAIL policy outperforms a
PPO baseline in simulation, achieving higher rewards, faster convergence, and
lower variance. Crucially, it transfers directly to a real-world robot without
fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a
prior TD3-based method. These results show that LfD offers a robust,
reward-free alternative to RL in cinematic domains, enabling real-time
deployment with minimal technical effort. Our pipeline brings intuitive,
stylized camera control within reach of creative professionals, bridging the
gap between artistic intent and robotic autonomy.

Conclusion: Galaxea数据集与G0框架为机器人行为的开放世界学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of
robot behaviors recorded in authentic human living and working environments.
All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired
with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and
evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework
that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained
using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training,
single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A
comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and
long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage,
together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in
achieving strong performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶技术在与人类驾驶车辆（HDV）的交互中，尤其是在变道过程中仍存在安全与舒适性挑战，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用双五次多项式方法，结合TTC评估机制，直接嵌入轨迹优化过程，实现实时安全感知的轨迹生成。

Result: 仿真实验表明，该方法在安全性、效率和舒适性上优于传统方法（如五次多项式、Bezier曲线和B-样条）。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动驾驶提供了一种稳定、安全的混合交通轨迹规划解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent
years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with
human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This
paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and
efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method
integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into
the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively
maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The
framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and
HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC
computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the
closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware
trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations
conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency,
and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as
quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that
the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth
transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work
bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning
approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications.

Abstract: Extensive research has already been conducted in the autonomous driving field
to help vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. At the same time, plenty of
current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which
largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of
VRUs. However, existing research still exhibits several gaps, including the
lack of a unified planning and collision avoidance system for autonomous
vehicles, limited investigation into delay tolerant control strategies, and the
absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU
safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving,
particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year
project, we focused on applying the Vehicle in Virtual Environment (VVE) method
to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate safety functions for Vulnerable Road
Users (VRUs) using automated steering and braking of ADS. In this current
second year project report, our primary focus was on enhancing the previous
year results while also considering bicyclist safety.

Conclusion: 该框架为自动驾驶轨迹规划提供了更高效、稳定和舒适的解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety,
stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory
planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high
computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited
validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose
an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i)
a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly
balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this
cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of
desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed
framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a
dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is
based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and
sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The
sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the
proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives,
providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization
methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of
scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.

Conclusion: CARIS为HRI研究提供了一种公开可用的上下文自适应工具，支持智能机器人行为的快速开发。

Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) field has traditionally used Wizard-of-Oz
(WoZ) controlled robots to explore navigation, conversational dynamics,
human-in-the-loop interactions, and more to explore appropriate robot behaviors
in everyday settings. However, existing WoZ tools are often limited to one
context, making them less adaptable across different settings, users, and
robotic platforms. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Context-Adaptable
Robot Interface System (CARIS) that combines advanced robotic capabilities such
teleoperation, human perception, human-robot dialogue, and multimodal data
recording. Through pilot studies, we demonstrate the potential of CARIS to WoZ
control a robot in two contexts: 1) mental health companion and as a 2) tour
guide. Furthermore, we identified areas of improvement for CARIS, including
smoother integration between movement and communication, clearer functionality
separation, recommended prompts, and one-click communication options to enhance
the usability wizard control of CARIS. This project offers a publicly
available, context-adaptable tool for the HRI community, enabling researchers
to streamline data-driven approaches to intelligent robot behavior.

Abstract: Visual SLAM algorithms have been enhanced through the exploration of Gaussian
Splatting representations, particularly in generating high-fidelity dense maps.
While existing methods perform reliably in static environments, they often
encounter camera tracking drift and fuzzy mapping when dealing with the
disturbances caused by moving objects. This paper presents DyPho-SLAM, a
real-time, resource-efficient visual SLAM system designed to address the
challenges of localization and photorealistic mapping in environments with
dynamic objects. Specifically, the proposed system integrates prior image
information to generate refined masks, effectively minimizing noise from mask
misjudgment. Additionally, to enhance constraints for optimization after
removing dynamic obstacles, we devise adaptive feature extraction strategies
significantly improving the system's resilience. Experiments conducted on
publicly dynamic RGB-D datasets demonstrate that the proposed system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation and dense map
reconstruction, while operating in real-time in dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅扩展了现有技术的适用范围，还通过CGS提升了计算效率，为更广泛的机械臂逆运动学问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a
specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer
algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive
rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse
kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We
extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of
two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF
manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is
expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is
solved using the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) with joint parameters of
the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive
calculations of the Gr\"obner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method
is shown by experiments.

Abstract: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a
6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the
motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we
are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector
should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse
kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The
proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible
region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector.
Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint
configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the
specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to
the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by
reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying
Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by
experiments.

Conclusion: CDF-MPPI框架在高维运动规划中表现出高效性和可靠性，优于传统优化和无梯度方法。

Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in
robotics. Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients
of signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints.
However, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the
SDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have
been introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration
space. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and
thus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free
approaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage
long-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these
methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory
samples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost
functions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a
framework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the
robot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost
in joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting
computation while preserving collision avoidance in practice. We demonstrate
that our approach achieves nearly 100% success rates in 2D environments and
consistently high success rates in challenging 7-DOF Franka manipulator
simulations with complex obstacles. Furthermore, our method attains control
frequencies exceeding 750 Hz, substantially outperforming both
optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines. These results highlight the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDF-MPPI framework for
high-dimensional motion planning.

Abstract: This paper presents an MFG-based decision-making framework for autonomous
driving in heterogeneous traffic. To capture diverse human behaviors, we
propose a quantitative driving style representation that maps abstract traits
to parameters such as speed, safety factors, and reaction time. These
parameters are embedded into the MFG through a spatial influence field model.
To ensure safe operation in dense traffic, we introduce a safety-critical
lane-changing algorithm that leverages dynamic safety margins,
time-to-collision analysis, and multi-layered constraints. Real-world NGSIM
data is employed for style calibration and empirical validation. Experimental
results demonstrate zero collisions across six style combinations, two

conventional game-theoretic baselines. Overall, our approach provides a

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了高自由度系统的实时运动规划问题。

Abstract: We present a fast and reactive grasping framework for multi-DoF grippers that
combines task-space velocity fields with a joint-space Quadratic Program (QP)
in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is
particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, since simultaneous increases in
state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of
the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we
plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions,
and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This
approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space
coordinates (or in some cases a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a
weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields
with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments with
privileged knowledge and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking
algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand
systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to
dynamic environments and external disturbances.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软机器人的灵活性在提升适应性和安全性方面具有优势，但也带来了运动高度不确定和非线性的挑战，尤其是开环控制方法缺乏反馈机制时更为明显。

Method: 研究使用FPE（随机过程的主方程）控制软机器人的概率分布，而非直接控制状态，并提出FPE-MPC方法。

Result: 通过两个数值模拟案例研究验证了FPE-MPC在管理软机器人系统中不确定性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: FPE-MPC策略为解决软机器人控制中的不确定性问题提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: The inherent flexibility of soft robots offers numerous advantages, such as
enhanced adaptability and improved safety. However, this flexibility can also
introduce challenges regarding highly uncertain and nonlinear motion. These
challenges become particularly problematic when using open-loop control
methods, which lack a feedback mechanism and are commonly employed in soft
robot control. Though one potential solution is model-based control, typical
deterministic models struggle with uncertainty as mentioned above. The idea is
to use the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), a master equation of a stochastic
process, to control not the state of soft robots but the probabilistic
distribution. In this study, we propose and implement a stochastic-based
control strategy, termed FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC), for a
soft robotic finger. Two numerical simulation case studies examine the
performance and characteristics of this control method, revealing its efficacy

Motivation: 解决现有SLAM方法在动态特征剔除和姿态估计中适应性不足及环境感知缺失的问题。

Result: 在公开数据集和实际场景中SRR-SLAM优于现有方法，精度提升达90%。

Conclusion: SRR-SLAM显著提高了自主机器人感知系统的测量精度和可靠性。

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a critical role in
autonomous robotic systems, especially where accurate and reliable measurements
are essential for navigation and sensing. In feature-based SLAM, the
quantityand quality of extracted features significantly influence system
performance. Due to the variations in feature quantity and quality across
diverse environments, current approaches face two major challenges: (1) limited
adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and (2)
insufficient environmental awareness in assessment and optimization strategies.
To address these issues, we propose SRR-SLAM, a scene-reliability based
framework that enhances feature-based SLAM through environment-aware
processing. Our method introduces a unified scene reliability assessment
mechanism that incorporates multiple metrics and historical observations to
guide system behavior. Based on this assessment, we develop: (i) adaptive
dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints, (ii)
depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal
in high-dimensional settings, and (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that
dynamically integrates direct methods when features are insufficient.
Furthermore, we propose (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a
weighted optimization scheme to reduce computational overhead while improving
estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real world
scenarios show that SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods,
achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse
environments. These improvements directly contribute to enhanced measurement
precision and reliability in autonomous robotic sensing systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合伪刚体模型(PRBM)和对数递减法(LDM)的新方法(PRBM+LDM)，用于提高软体机器人抓取的实时动态性能，相比传统PID控制器表现出更低误差和更强的力控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软体机器人（尤其是软体手）的连续变形特性使得其控制极具挑战，现有模型计算效率低且参数识别复杂，限制了实时应用。

Method: 结合伪刚体模型(PRBM)与对数递减法(LDM)，设计了一种参数估计方法(PRBM+LDM)，并基于此实现了闭环位置和力控制器。

Result: PRBM+LDM在位置控制中平均最大误差为4.37度（PID为20.38度）；在力控制中，对脆弱物体的抓取表现优于恒压抓取（如薯片86 vs. 82.5）。

Conclusion: PRBM+LDM是一种计算高效且精确的软体致动器建模技术，能够实现稳定、灵活的抓取和精确的力调节。

Abstract: The rapid advancement in physical human-robot interaction (HRI) has
accelerated the development of soft robot designs and controllers. Controlling
soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is challenging due to their
continuous deformation, motivating the use of reduced model-based controllers
for real-time dynamic performance. Most existing models, however, suffer from
computational inefficiency and complex parameter identification, limiting their
real-time applicability. To address this, we propose a paradigm coupling
Pseudo-Rigid Body Modeling with the Logarithmic Decrement Method for parameter
estimation (PRBM plus LDM). Using a soft robotic hand test bed, we validate
PRBM plus LDM for predicting position and force output from pressure input and
benchmark its performance. We then implement PRBM plus LDM as the basis for
closed-loop position and force controllers. Compared to a simple PID
controller, the PRBM plus LDM position controller achieves lower error (average
maximum error across all fingers: 4.37 degrees versus 20.38 degrees). For force
control, PRBM plus LDM outperforms constant pressure grasping in pinching tasks
on delicate objects: potato chip 86 versus 82.5, screwdriver 74.42 versus 70,
brass coin 64.75 versus 35. These results demonstrate PRBM plus LDM as a
computationally efficient and accurate modeling technique for soft actuators,
enabling stable and flexible grasping with precise force regulation.

Conclusion: 所提出的设计范式为康复软体机器人提供了性能优化的解决方案，并通过仿生结构和分析模型提升了执行器的可控性和适应性。

Abstract: Soft robots have been increasingly utilized as sophisticated tools in
physical rehabilitation, particularly for assisting patients with neuromotor
impairments. However, many soft robotics for rehabilitation applications are
characterized by limitations such as slow response times, restricted range of
motion, and low output force. There are also limited studies on the precise
position and force control of wearable soft actuators. Furthermore, not many
studies articulate how bellow-structured actuator designs quantitatively
contribute to the robots' capability. This study introduces a paradigm of upper
limb soft actuator design. This paradigm comprises two actuators: the
Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot (LISPER) for the elbow and the
Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot (SCASPER) for the shoulder. LISPER is
characterized by higher bandwidth, increased output force/torque, and high
linearity. SCASPER is characterized by high output force/torque and simplified
fabrication processes. Comprehensive analytical models that describe the
relationship between pressure, bending angles, and output force for both
actuators were presented so the geometric configuration of the actuators can be
set to modify the range of motion and output forces. The preliminary test on a
dummy arm is conducted to test the capability of the actuators.

Abstract: Multi-agent distributed collaborative mapping provides comprehensive and
efficient representations for robots. However, existing approaches lack
instance-level awareness and semantic understanding of environments, limiting
their effectiveness for downstream applications. To address this issue, we
propose OpenMulti, an open-vocabulary instance-level multi-agent distributed

Alignment module, which constructs an Instance Collaborative Graph to ensure
consistent instance understanding across agents. To alleviate the degradation
of mapping accuracy due to the blind-zone optimization trap, we leverage Cross
Rendering Supervision to enhance distributed learning of the scene.
Experimental results show that OpenMulti outperforms related algorithms in both
fine-grained geometric accuracy and zero-shot semantic accuracy. In addition,
OpenMulti supports instance-level retrieval tasks, delivering semantic
annotations for downstream applications. The project website of OpenMulti is

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合多标准，为自动驾驶车辆轨迹优化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization
of autonomous vehicle trajectories, integrating formal safety, comfort, and
efficiency criteria. An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis
of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify
collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the
intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations.
Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk,
while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are
aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based
algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic
conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an
autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation
using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.

Conclusion: 解耦多上下文元学习框架显著提升了任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力，并实现了高效的跨任务共享和现实应用。

Abstract: In meta-learning and its downstream tasks, many methods rely on implicit
adaptation to task variations, where multiple factors are mixed together in a
single entangled representation. This makes it difficult to interpret which
factors drive performance and can hinder generalization. In this work, we
introduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly
assigns each task factor to a distinct context vector. By decoupling these
variations, our approach improves robustness through deeper task understanding
and enhances generalization by enabling context vector sharing across tasks
with shared factors. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a
sinusoidal regression task, our model outperforms baselines on
out-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing
context vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a
quadruped robot locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties
and the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. By
transferring disentangled context vectors acquired from the dynamics model into
reinforcement learning, the resulting policy achieves improved robustness under
out-of-distribution conditions, surpassing the baselines that rely on a single
unified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables
successful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with
out-of-distribution robot-specific properties, using just 20 seconds of real
data from flat terrain, a result not achievable with single-task adaptation.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) has made great progress with large language

new framework that leverages topological structures as spatial memory. By
building and updating a topological graph that captures scene connections,

distant goals. Our experiments show that TopoNav achieves state-of-the-art
performance on benchmark ObjectNav datasets, with higher success rates and more
efficient paths. It particularly excels in diverse and complex environments, as
it connects temporary visual inputs with lasting spatial understanding.

examining the impact of on-demand assistance received from a remote human in a
human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly task. We study scenarios in which
users require help and we assess their experiences in requesting and receiving
assistance. Additionally, we investigate participants' perceptions of future
non-human assisting agents and whether assistance should be on-demand or
unsolicited. Through a user study, we analyze the impact that such design
decisions (human or artificial assistant, on-demand or unsolicited help) can
have on elicited emotional responses, productivity, and preferences of humans

Abstract: Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perceptual
capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional
SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction,
and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality
mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face
challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce
FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the
scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial
pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse
point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we
maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and
introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene
representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify
level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across
various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.

Conclusion: 本文方法在不增加计算负担的情况下，有效提高了物体相对位姿估计的准确性，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

Abstract: Lane change decision-making for autonomous vehicles is a complex but
high-reward behavior. In this paper, we propose a hybrid input based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which realizes abstract lane change
decisions and lane change actions for autonomous vehicles within traffic flow.
Firstly, a surrounding vehicles trajectory prediction method is proposed to
reduce the risk of future behavior of surrounding vehicles to ego vehicle, and
the prediction results are input into the reinforcement learning model as
additional information. Secondly, to comprehensively leverage environmental
information, the model extracts feature from high-dimensional images and
low-dimensional sensor data simultaneously. The fusion of surrounding vehicle
trajectory prediction and multi-modal information are used as state space of
reinforcement learning to improve the rationality of lane change decision.
Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning macro decisions with end-to-end
vehicle control to achieve a holistic lane change process. Experiments were
conducted within the CARLA simulator, and the results demonstrated that the
utilization of a hybrid state space significantly enhances the safety of
vehicle lane change decisions.

Abstract: This paper examines the speculative topic of equitable robots through an

what aspirational queer robotics futures may look like, both in the arts and
sciences. First, it briefly reviews the state-of-the-art of queer robotics in
fiction and science, drawing together threads from each. Then, it discusses
queering robots through three speculative design proposals for queer robot
roles: 1) reflecting the queerness of their ''in-group'' queer users, building
and celebrating ''in-group'' identity, 2) a new kind of queer activism by
implementing queer robot identity performance to interact with ''out-group''
users, with a goal of reducing bigotry through familiarisation, and 3) a
network of queer-owned robots, through which the community could reach each
other, and distribute and access important resources. The paper then questions
whether robots should be queered, and what ethical implications this raises.
Finally, the paper makes suggestions for what aspirational queer robotics
futures may look like, and what would be required to get there.

Conclusion: 结论表明，IWR通过简单修改即可有效改善数据选择的偏差和噪声问题，为基于检索的模仿学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation
learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for
deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot
imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts
relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a
limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior
datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data
point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.
While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data
selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel
density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two
shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on
high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,
it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To
address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which
estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data
distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the
probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,
and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates
using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world
evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently
improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only
requiring minor modifications.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation stands as a core challenge in robotics, enabling robots
to assist humans across varied tasks and dynamic daily environments.
Conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across
different tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training.
However, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate
impressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation
tasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a
plug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf
manipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability.
Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate
robot docking points for generalized mobile manipulation. To enable zero-shot
ability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language
models (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic
arm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can
be employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base
and robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and
maintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the
robot to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be
successfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory
optimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any
requirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ArtiPoint是一个新颖的框架，用于在动态相机运动和部分观测下推断关节物体模型，结合了深度点跟踪和图优化，表现优于现有方法。并推出了首个野生环境下的数据集Arti4D。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究三维关节物体运动对机器人场景理解、移动操作和运动规划至关重要，但目前方法在非控制环境中效果不佳。

Method: 结合深度点跟踪和因子图优化框架，直接从RGB-D视频中估计关节部分轨迹和轴。

Result: 在Arti4D数据集上，ArtiPoint表现优于传统和学习基线方法。

Conclusion: ArtiPoint为关节物体估计提供了鲁棒解决方案，并公开了数据集和代码以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人基础模型虽然能泛化到多样化任务，但缺乏对行为正确性和安全约束的显式定义，可能导致潜在风险。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效过滤不安全动作并支持条件性动作生成。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为机器人基础模型提供了安全性和行为约束的有效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to
promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These
models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-
modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then
executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the
perspective of im- proved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are
still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral
correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing
a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces
logical constraints on action trajec- tories in dynamical systems. Our method
ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the
underlying foundation model. We perform com- prehensive evaluation of our
approach across state-of-the-art navigation founda- tion models and we show
that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe
actions but also for conditional action-generation. Videos available on our

Conclusion: Fail2Progress在仿真和真实实验中表现优于基线方法，证明了其在失败学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Skill effect models for long-horizon manipulation tasks are prone to failures
in conditions not covered by training data distributions. Therefore, enabling
robots to reason about and learn from failures is necessary. We investigate the
problem of efficiently generating a dataset targeted to observed failures.
After fine-tuning a skill effect model on this dataset, we evaluate the extent
to which the model can recover from failures and minimize future failures. We
propose Fail2Progress, an approach that leverages Stein variational inference
to generate multiple simulation environments in parallel, enabling efficient
data sample generation similar to observed failures. Our method is capable of
handling several challenging mobile manipulation tasks, including transporting
multiple objects, organizing a constrained shelf, and tabletop organization.
Through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach excels at learning from failures across different numbers of
objects. Furthermore, we show that Fail2Progress outperforms several baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需超参数调整的梯度优化方法，通过策略梯度投影在任务和能耗目标之间平衡，实现能耗最小化且不影响任务表现。该方法在多个基准测试中减少了64%能耗，并展示了Sim2Real的迁移能力。


<details>

Motivation: 传统强化学习需在奖励函数中直接惩罚能耗，但需精心调整权重以避免任务表现受损。本文旨在提出一种更简单且无需超参数的方法。

Method: 采用策略梯度投影技术，在任务目标和能耗目标之间优化策略更新，避免能耗最小化与任务表现的冲突。

Result: 在DM-Control和HumanoidBench基准测试中，能耗减少64%且任务表现不受影响，同时在Unitree GO2四足机器人上展示了Sim2Real迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该方法作为一种替代奖励塑形的原则性方法，易于在标准RL流程中实现，适用于任何策略梯度方法。

Abstract: Efficient robot control often requires balancing task performance with energy
expenditure. A common approach in reinforcement learning (RL) is to penalize
energy use directly as part of the reward function. This requires carefully
tuning weight terms to avoid undesirable trade-offs where energy minimization
harms task success. In this work, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient
optimization method to minimize energy expenditure without conflicting with
task performance. Inspired by recent works in multitask learning, our method
applies policy gradient projection between task and energy objectives to derive
policy updates that minimize energy expenditure in ways that do not impact task
performance. We evaluate this technique on standard locomotion benchmarks of
DM-Control and HumanoidBench and demonstrate a reduction of 64% energy usage
while maintaining comparable task performance. Further, we conduct experiments
on a Unitree GO2 quadruped showcasing Sim2Real transfer of energy efficient
policies. Our method is easy to implement in standard RL pipelines with minimal
code changes, is applicable to any policy gradient method, and offers a
principled alternative to reward shaping for energy efficient control policies.

Abstract: This paper introduces ManiFlow, a visuomotor imitation learning policy for
general robot manipulation that generates precise, high-dimensional actions
conditioned on diverse visual, language and proprioceptive inputs. We leverage
flow matching with consistency training to enable high-quality dexterous action
generation in just 1-2 inference steps. To handle diverse input modalities
efficiently, we propose DiT-X, a diffusion transformer architecture with

feature interactions between action tokens and multi-modal observations.
ManiFlow demonstrates consistent improvements across diverse simulation
benchmarks and nearly doubles success rates on real-world tasks across
single-arm, bimanual, and humanoid robot setups with increasing dexterity. The
extensive evaluation further demonstrates the strong robustness and
generalizability of ManiFlow to novel objects and background changes, and

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了多船舶轨迹预测的准确性，同时提供了增强海事安全和决策支持的可操作见解。

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational
awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are
constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel
interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We
present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction
with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the
framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future
trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical
features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations
for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both
local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale
real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates
superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement
errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework
further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to
strengthen maritime safety and decision support.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the
need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Conclusion: AutoDrive-R²有效提升了自动驾驶系统的推理和自我反思能力，为未来的研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary
surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is
studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of
performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging
Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission
complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and
efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission
objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study
presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration,
integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a
scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical
scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key
capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework
which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo
simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its
robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system
feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior
execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is
middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and
extending beyond aerial robotics.

Conclusion: 结论是提出的框架有效简化了复杂机械系统的滑动模態控制设计，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for designing sliding mode controllers
for a class of mechanical systems with symmetry, both unconstrained and
constrained, that evolve on principal fiber bundles. Control laws are developed
based on the reduced motion equations by exploring symmetries, leading to a
sliding mode control strategy where the reaching stage is executed on the base
space, and the sliding stage is performed on the structure group. Thus, design
complexity is reduced, and difficult choices for coordinate representations
when working with a particular Lie group are avoided. For this purpose, a
sliding subgroup is constructed on the structure group based on a kinematic
controller, and the sliding variable will converge to the identity of the state
manifold upon reaching the sliding subgroup. A reaching law based on a general
sliding vector field is then designed on the base space using the local form of
the mechanical connection to drive the sliding variable to the sliding
subgroup, and its time evolution is given according to the appropriate
covariant derivative. Almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential
stability are demonstrated using a Lyapunov analysis. We apply the results to a
fully actuated system (a rigid spacecraft actuated by reaction wheels) and a
subactuated nonholonomic system (unicycle mobile robot actuated by wheels),
which is also simulated for illustration.

Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) in multi-object teleoperation tasks
faces significant challenges due to perceptual ambiguities in virtual reality
(VR) environments and the limitations of single-modality intention recognition.
This paper proposes a shared control framework that combines a virtual
admittance (VA) model with a Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception
Network (MMIPN) to enhance teleoperation performance and user experience. The
VA model employs artificial potential fields to guide operators toward target
objects by adjusting admittance force and optimizing motion trajectories. MMIPN
processes multimodal inputs, including gaze movement, robot motions, and
environmental context, to estimate human grasping intentions, helping to
overcome depth perception challenges in VR. Our user study evaluated four
conditions across two factors, and the results showed that MMIPN significantly
improved grasp success rates, while the VA model enhanced movement efficiency
by reducing path lengths. Gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality.
These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal cues with
implicit guidance in VR-based teleoperation, providing a robust solution for
multi-object grasping tasks and enabling more natural interactions across
various applications in the future.

Abstract: Deep learning-based LiDAR odometry is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotic navigation, yet its performance under adverse weather, especially
snowfall, remains challenging. Existing models struggle to generalize across
conditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use.
In this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap
between clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective
denoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose
estimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time
applications.
  To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that
evaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective
detection of sparse and discrete noise.
  We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive
point-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local
regions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity
threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and
then perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight
prediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is
trained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various
scenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm
the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear
and snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and
paves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across
a wider range of environmental conditions.

Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在适应新机器人平台或任务时，由于动作分布不匹配，需要大量数据和计算资源进行微调。

Result: 实验显示，ATE在模拟和真实世界中的跨平台和跨任务操作中，分别实现了多任务成功率最高9.8%和32%的提升。

Conclusion: ATE是一个通用且轻量级的解决方案，显著提升了VLA模型在新机器人平台和任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets
show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a
primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks,
especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the
pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action
distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning.
To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer
(\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation
framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a
unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL
divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action
latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's
generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the
model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive
experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation
and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our
method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in
simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a
real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and
lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA
models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

Result: 方法在四种机器人上验证成功，表现出高效性和鲁棒性，尤其是在并联机构(PKMs)中。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性、鲁棒性和高效性，为机器人参数识别提供了新的理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel geometric method for analytically determining the
base inertial parameters of robotic systems. The rigid body dynamics is
reformulated using projective geometric algebra, leading to a new
identification model named ``tetrahedral-point (TP)" model. Based on the rigid
body TP model, coefficients in the regresoor matrix of the identification model
are derived in closed-form, exhibiting clear geometric interpretations.
Building directly from the dynamic model, three foundational principles for
base parameter analysis are proposed: the shared points principle, fixed points
principle, and planar rotations principle. With these principles, algorithms
are developed to automatically determine all the base parameters. The core
algorithm, referred to as Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG),
achieves $O(1)$-complexity theoretically following an $O(N)$-complexity
preprocessing stage, where $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. The proposed
method and algorithms are validated across four robots: Puma560, Unitree Go2, a
2RRU-1RRS parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM), and a 2PRS-1PSR PKM. In all
cases, the algorithms successfully identify the complete set of base
parameters. Notably, the approach demonstrates high robustness and
computational efficiency, particularly in the cases of PKMs. Through the
comprehensive demonstrations, the method is shown to be general, robust, and
efficient.

Conclusion: 通过学习社会价值函数并将其整合到路径规划中，可以显著提高社交机器人导航的社会适应性和接受度。

Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in
recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent
along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and
predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really
be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms
that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated
learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value

Conclusion: 研究展示了如何在计算复杂性和解的质量之间取得平衡，为优化工业机器人布局提供了新方法。

Abstract: The performance of industrial robotic work cells depends on optimizing
various hyperparameters referring to the cell layout, such as robot base
placement, tool placement, and kinematic design. Achieving this requires a
bilevel optimization approach, where the high-level optimization adjusts these
hyperparameters, and the low-level optimization computes robot motions.
However, computing the optimal robot motion is computationally infeasible,
introducing trade-offs in motion planning to make the problem tractable. These
trade-offs significantly impact the overall performance of the bilevel
optimization, but their effects still need to be systematically evaluated. In
this paper, we introduce metrics to assess these trade-offs regarding
optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency. Through extensive
simulation studies, we investigate how simplifications in motion-level
optimization affect the high-level optimization outcomes, balancing
computational complexity with solution quality. The proposed algorithms are
applied to find the time-optimal kinematic design for a modular robot in two
palletization scenarios.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
revolutionised embodied artificial intelligence, enabling advanced

conditions compared to baseline scenarios. This work bridges the gap between
safety and security in LLM-based robotic systems, offering actionable insights
for deploying reliable LLM-integrated mobile robots in real-world settings. The

Abstract: Accurate and robust environmental perception is crucial for robot autonomous
navigation. While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g.,
camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual
occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In
this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the
risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration
capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as
a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and
accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance
signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based
hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts
then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically
designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data.
We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a
self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic
prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously
reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively.
Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate
classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing
methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate
3D radar perception.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects presents
significant challenges due to high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and
the need for accurate vision-language grounding. In this work, we focus on
multi-step cloth folding, a representative deformable-object manipulation task
that requires both structured long-horizon planning and fine-grained visual
perception. To this end, we propose a unified framework that integrates a Large
Language Model (LLM)-based planner, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based
perception system, and a task execution module. Specifically, the LLM-based
planner decomposes high-level language instructions into low-level action
primitives, bridging the semantic-execution gap, aligning perception with
action, and enhancing generalization. The VLM-based perception module employs a
SigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion
mechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to
achieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In
simulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3
on seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a
real robot, it robustly executes multi-step folding sequences from language
instructions across diverse cloth materials and configurations, demonstrating
strong generalization in practical scenarios. Project page:

Abstract: Optical microrobots actuated by optical tweezers (OT) offer great potential
for biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and microscale assembly.
These tasks demand accurate three-dimensional perception to ensure precise
control in complex and dynamic biological environments. However, the
transparent nature of microrobots and low-contrast microscopic imaging
challenge conventional deep learning methods, which also require large
annotated datasets that are costly to obtain. To address these challenges, we
propose a physics-informed, data-efficient framework for depth estimation of
optical microrobots. Our method augments convolutional feature extraction with
physics-based focus metrics, such as entropy, Laplacian of Gaussian, and
gradient sharpness, calculated using an adaptive grid strategy. This approach
allocates finer grids over microrobot regions and coarser grids over background
areas, enhancing depth sensitivity while reducing computational complexity. We
evaluate our framework on multiple microrobot types and demonstrate significant
improvements over baseline models. Specifically, our approach reduces mean
squared error (MSE) by over 60% and improves the coefficient of determination
(R^2) across all test cases. Notably, even when trained on only 20% of the
available data, our model outperforms ResNet50 trained on the full dataset,
highlighting its robustness under limited data conditions. Our code is

Abstract: Indoor built environments like homes and offices often present complex and
cluttered layouts that pose significant challenges for individuals who are
blind or visually impaired, especially when performing tasks that involve
locating and gathering multiple objects. While many existing assistive
technologies focus on basic navigation or obstacle avoidance, few systems
provide scalable and efficient multi-object search capabilities in real-world,
partially observable settings. To address this gap, we introduce OpenGuide, an
assistive mobile robot system that combines natural language understanding with
vision-language foundation models (VLM), frontier-based exploration, and a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planner. OpenGuide
interprets open-vocabulary requests, reasons about object-scene relationships,
and adaptively navigates and localizes multiple target items in novel
environments. Our approach enables robust recovery from missed detections
through value decay and belief-space reasoning, resulting in more effective
exploration and object localization. We validate OpenGuide in simulated and
real-world experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in task success
rate and search efficiency over prior methods. This work establishes a
foundation for scalable, human-centered robotic assistance in assisted living
environments.

Conclusion: Coral为广泛机器人系统集成挑战提供了可扩展的解决方案，并通过开源发布促进了工具的普及。

Abstract: Despite the multitude of excellent software components and tools available in
the robotics and broader software engineering communities, successful
integration of software for robotic systems remains a time-consuming and
challenging task for users of all knowledge and skill levels. And with robotics
software often being built into tightly coupled, monolithic systems, even minor
alterations to improve performance, adjust to changing task requirements, or
deploy to new hardware can require significant engineering investment. To help
solve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for
building, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that
maximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying
low-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by
introducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process
to semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without
limiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral
in detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of
increasing complexity, including LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion
mitigation tasks. By enabling practical composability in robotics software,
Coral offers a scalable solution to a broad range of robotics system
integration challenges, improving component reusability, system
reconfigurability, and accessibility to both expert and non-expert users. We
release Coral open source.

Result: 研究发现四种VBTS机制各有特点，同时揭示了当前技术面临的挑战。

Conclusion: 论文总结了VBTS的分类方法和研究现状，为未来技术发展提供了方向。

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) have gained widespread application in
robotic hands, grippers and prosthetics due to their high spatial resolution,
low manufacturing costs, and ease of customization. While VBTSs have common
design features, such as a camera module, they can differ in a rich diversity
of sensing principles, material compositions, multimodal approaches, and data
interpretation methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VBTS that
categorizes the technology into two primary sensing principles based on the
underlying transduction of contact into a tactile image: the Marker-Based
Transduction Principle and the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle.
Marker-Based Transduction interprets tactile information by detecting marker
displacement and changes in marker density. In contrast, Intensity-Based
Transduction maps external disturbances with variations in pixel values.
Depending on the design of the contact module, Marker-Based Transduction can be
further divided into two subtypes: Simple Marker-Based (SMB) and Morphological
Marker-Based (MMB) mechanisms. Similarly, the Intensity-Based Transduction
Principle encompasses the Reflective Layer-based (RLB) and Transparent
Layer-Based (TLB) mechanisms. This paper provides a comparative study of the
hardware characteristics of these four types of sensors including various
combination types, and discusses the commonly used methods for interpreting
tactile information. This~comparison reveals some current challenges faced by
VBTS technology and directions for future research.

Result: CDMs在深度预测上达到接近模拟级别的准确度，无需添加噪声或真实世界微调，即可在复杂任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法成功弥合了仿真与现实的差距，为利用3D信息的机器人策略研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS-SLAM系统因每帧需要多次训练迭代和大量高斯分布计算，导致效率低下。AGS旨在通过算法和硬件的协同优化解决这一问题。

Method: 软件层面：1）提出粗粒度到细粒度的位姿跟踪方法。2）通过跨帧共享高斯分布贡献信息避免冗余计算。硬件层面：设计帧共视检测引擎、位姿跟踪引擎和映射引擎，并配备工作负载调度器。

Result: 实验显示，AGS相比移动和高性能GPU及现有3DGS加速器GSCore，分别实现了最高17.12倍、6.71倍和5.41倍的加速。

Conclusion: AGS通过充分利用帧间相似性和算法-硬件协同优化，显著提升了3DGS-SLAM的效率，为实时应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical task that enables
autonomous vehicles to construct maps and localize themselves in unknown
environments. Recent breakthroughs combine SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) to achieve exceptional reconstruction fidelity. However, existing
3DGS-SLAM systems provide insufficient throughput due to the need for multiple
training iterations per frame and the vast number of Gaussians.
  In this paper, we propose AGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework to
boost the efficiency of 3DGS-SLAM based on the intuition that SLAM systems
process frames in a streaming manner, where adjacent frames exhibit high
similarity that can be utilized for acceleration. On the software level: 1) We
propose a coarse-then-fine-grained pose tracking method with respect to the
robot's movement. 2) We avoid redundant computations of Gaussians by sharing
their contribution information across frames. On the hardware level, we propose
a frame covisibility detection engine to extract intermediate data from the
video CODEC. We also implement a pose tracking engine and a mapping engine with
workload schedulers to efficiently deploy the AGS algorithm. Our evaluation
shows that AGS achieves up to $17.12\times$, $6.71\times$, and $5.41\times$
speedups against the mobile and high-end GPUs, and a state-of-the-art 3DGS
accelerator, GSCore.

Conclusion: 研究表明，地震前兆信号确实隐藏在环境地震噪声中，这为实时断层监测和短期地震预测提供了新途径。

Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in
science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors
should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world
seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature
or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive
frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent
frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and
normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic
records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku
and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory
signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging
hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic
settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental
strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate
that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a
pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake
forecasting.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SRv6 Flex-Algo的框架，用于在LEO卫星网络中实现高效能、高可靠性和低延迟的路由，通过MILP优化CPU功耗、数据包传输率和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模LEO星座网络中如何在节省能源、保证拥堵下可靠传输和满足低延迟要求的多目标路由问题。

Method: 采用SRv6 Flex-Algo框架，划分为三个逻辑切片（能耗优化、可靠性优先和低延迟），并通过MILP统一优化目标。

Result: 在Telesat Lightspeed星座的仿真中，平均CPU使用率降低73%，数据包传输率在流量高峰时保持91%以上，紧急流延迟减少18毫秒。

Conclusion: 该框架作为切片流量工程工具，在资源受限的卫星网络中表现出高效性能。

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) constellations demand routing that
simultaneously minimizes energy, guarantees delivery under congestion, and
meets latency requirements for time-critical flows. We present a segment
routing over IPv6 (SRv6) flexible algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework that consists
of three logical slices: an energy-efficient slice (Algo 130), a
high-reliability slice (Algo 129), and a latency-sensitive slice (Algo 128).
The framework provides a unified mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that
combines satellite CPU power, packet delivery rate (PDR), and end-to-end
latency into a single objective, allowing a lightweight software-defined
network (SDN) controller to steer traffic from the source node. Emulation of
Telesat's Lightspeed constellation shows that, compared with different routing
schemes, the proposed design reduces the average CPU usage by 73%, maintains a
PDR above 91% during traffic bursts, and decreases urgent flow delay by 18 ms
between Ottawa and Vancouver. The results confirm Flex-Algo's value as a
slice-based traffic engineering (TE) tool for resource-constrained satellite
networks.

Abstract: We introduce the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP), a challenging component
of large warehouse management which involves rearranging storage blocks within
dense grids to achieve a target state. We formally define the BRaP as a graph
search problem. Building on intuitions from sliding puzzle problems, we propose
five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply
buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有机器人系统在高层次认知、任务规划和自然语言交互方面的不足，Robix旨在提供一个端到端的统一框架。

Method: Robix采用三阶段训练策略：持续预训练、监督微调和强化学习，结合链式推理方法。

Result: 实验表明，Robix在交互任务执行上优于开源和商业基线模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro），表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Robix通过统一框架和高层次认知能力，有效提升了机器人在复杂任务和自然交互中的表现。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究基于FARS数据分析了ADAS（如PAEB、FCW和LDW）在降低行人死亡率中的效果，发现其在低光和恶劣天气下效果受限，需改进传感器技术和驾驶员教育。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国行人死亡率持续上升，ADAS被认为是通过提升驾驶员意识和车辆反应能力来改善行人安全的有潜力解决方案。

Method: 利用FARS数据进行综合分析，评估ADAS在不同环境和行为条件下的表现，如光照、天气和驾驶员/行人分心。

Result: ADAS能降低事故严重性和部分死亡率，但在低光和恶劣天气时效果下降。

Conclusion: 需改进传感器技术和驾驶员教育，以优化ADAS部署，提升行人安全性。

Abstract: Pedestrian fatalities continue to rise in the United States, driven by
factors such as human distraction, increased vehicle size, and complex traffic
environments. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) offer a promising
avenue for improving pedestrian safety by enhancing driver awareness and
vehicle responsiveness. This study conducts a comprehensive data-driven
analysis utilizing the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to quantify
the effectiveness of specific ADAS features like Pedestrian Automatic Emergency
Braking (PAEB), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning
(LDW), in lowering pedestrian fatalities. By linking vehicle specifications
with crash data, we assess how ADAS performance varies under different
environmental and behavioral conditions, such as lighting, weather, and
driver/pedestrian distraction. Results indicate that while ADAS can reduce
crash severity and prevent some fatalities, its effectiveness is diminished in
low-light and adverse weather. The findings highlight the need for enhanced
sensor technologies and improved driver education. This research informs
policymakers, transportation planners, and automotive manufacturers on
optimizing ADAS deployment to improve pedestrian safety and reduce
traffic-related deaths.

Conclusion: 论文强调了EAI风险的独特性，呼吁政策制定者迅速行动，提出具体建议以应对即将到来的EAI创新浪潮。

Abstract: The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI
can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. Given
recent innovations in large language and multimodal models, along with
increasingly advanced and responsive hardware, EAI systems are rapidly growing
in capabilities and operational domains. These advances present significant
risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, and
economic and societal disruption. However, these risks have been severely
overlooked by policymakers. Existing policies, such as international standards
for industrial robots or statutes governing autonomous vehicles, are
insufficient to address the full range of concerns. While lawmakers are
increasingly focused on AI, there is now an urgent need to extend and adapt
existing frameworks to account for the unique risks of EAI. To help bridge this
gap, this paper makes three contributions: first, we provide a foundational
taxonomy of key physical, informational, economic, and social EAI risks.
Secondly, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to identify how existing
frameworks address these risks and where these policies leave critical gaps. We
conclude by offering concrete policy recommendations to address the coming wave
of EAI innovation, including mandatory testing and certification for EAI
systems, clarified liability frameworks, and forward-looking strategies to
manage and prepare for transformative economic and societal impacts.

### [143] [DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177)
*Junxiang Liu,Junming Lin,Jiangtong Li,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出DynaMind框架，通过联合建模神经动态和语义特征，解决EEG信号重建动态视觉场景的挑战，显著提升视频重建的准确性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号空间分辨率低、与视频动态时间不匹配、语义信息利用不足，导致现有方法无法有效解析动态一致性和复杂语义背景。

Method: DynaMind包含三个核心模块：RSM（区域感知语义映射器）、TDA（时间感知动态对齐器）和DGVR（双引导视频重建器），分别提取多模态语义特征、生成动态潜在序列，并重建高保真视频。

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上，DynaMind在视频和帧级别的准确性上分别提升了12.5和10.3个百分点，SSIM和FVMD指标也有显著改善。

Conclusion: DynaMind填补了神经动态与高保真视觉语义之间的鸿沟，是脑解码领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Motivation: 传统3D LiDAR点云分割依赖大量标注数据，成本高；可利用丰富的2D图像数据通过跨模态知识蒸馏减少标注需求。

Method: 提出UDAKD和FSKD两种方法，利用2D-3D对应关系对齐3D网络输出与2D网络，采用自校准卷积处理3D点云。

Result: 实验表明所提方法在3D LiDAR语义分割上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 跨模态知识蒸馏能有效减少3D标注需求，同时保持性能，未来可扩展至更多跨模态任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角3D人体姿态估计在新摄像头配置下泛化能力差，现有基于注意力机制的方法难以准确建模空间关键点布局，尤其在遮挡场景中。

Method: 提出MV-SSM框架，包括投影状态空间（PSS）块和网格令牌引导双向扫描（GTBS），显式建模多视角图像特征和关键点空间序列。

Result: 在多个实验中表现出色，如CMU Panoptic三摄像头设置下AP25提升24%，跨数据集评估中PCP提升38%。

Conclusion: MV-SSM在泛化性和性能上优于现有方法，解决了多视角3D姿态估计中的关键挑战。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型（VFMs）的参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，用于恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计，通过选择-调优-保持（STM）策略平衡适应性与预训练知识的保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计缺乏可靠的地面真实数据且难以从未标记的真实数据中学习，现有方法依赖合成数据或违反光度假设的自监督学习。

Method: 采用PEFT方法，设计STM策略，基于熵-秩和稳定-秩的结构化分解，选择任务感知的奇异方向进行初始化，并通过正则化保持预训练知识的泛化能力。

Result: 在四种真实恶劣天气基准测试中超越现有PEFT方法、全微调方法及使用合成数据的方法，甚至超过深度基础模型。

Conclusion: STM策略有效平衡了任务适应性与预训练知识的保留，实现了恶劣天气下高性能的深度估计。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

Abstract: Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, with climate change, ocean
acidification, and pollution leading to a projected 70-90% loss of coral
species within the next decade. Restoration efforts are crucial, but their
success hinges on introducing automation to upscale efforts. We present
automated deployment of coral re-seeding devices powered by artificial
intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Specifically, we perform automated
substrate classification, enabling detection of areas of the seafloor suitable
for coral growth, thus significantly reducing reliance on human experts and
increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the
algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%,
sub-image patch classification of 89.1%, and real-time model inference at 5.5
frames per second. Further, we present and publicly contribute a large
collection of annotated substrate image data to foster future research in this
area.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在高动态范围和低延迟方面优于传统相机，但在极端光照变化下的视觉地点识别（VPR）仍具挑战性，因此需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用一种基于集成的框架，结合了事件到帧的多种重建方法、VPR特征提取器和时间分辨率，并通过序列匹配优化提升性能。

Result: 在日夜间光照变化下，Recall@1相对提升了57%，并在两个长距离驾驶数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了事件相机在极端光照下的地点识别能力，并通过分析和优化关键设计选择为未来研究提供了参考。

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

Motivation: 传统高分辨率图像捕获方法速度慢且计算复杂，无法满足实时动态成像需求。

Method: 结合专用采样策略与定制重建方法，采用两阶段重建：先通过测量矩阵广义逆快速恢复图像，再利用空间稀疏性通过迭代方法或神经网络增强密集区域重建。

Result: 在压缩比0.41%和22kHz DMD操作下，成像速率为6.8Hz，支持实时高分辨率动态成像，重建速度与中端桌面GPU匹配。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了快速、高质量的高分辨率图像捕获，适用于实时动态成像场景。

Abstract: We introduce a compressive single-pixel imaging (SPI) framework for
high-resolution image capture in fractions of a second. This framework combines
a dedicated sampling strategy with a tailored reconstruction method to enable
high-quality imaging of spatially sparse scenes at the native 1024x768
resolution of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The reconstruction process
consists of two phases: first, the measured data is processed using the
generalized inverse of the measurement matrix for quick image recovery. Then,
the spatial sparsity of the scene is leveraged to enhance reconstruction in
dense areas, using either an iterative method or a neural network-based
approach. With a compression ratio of 0.41% and an image acquisition rate of
6.8 Hz at 22 kHz DMD operation, this framework supports real-time,
high-resolution dynamic imaging with the reconstruction that matches the
acquisition rate on a mid-tier desktop GPU.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有目标导向语义通信方法存在联合训练冗余和数据标签依赖等问题，限制了其任务无关的实用性，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出SC-GIR框架，利用协方差对比学习技术提取不变表示，以紧凑的形式保留关键信息，支持多任务需求。

Result: 实验表明，SC-GIR在多种数据集上表现优于基线方案近10%，并在不同信噪比下实现85%以上的分类准确率。

Conclusion: SC-GIR框架能有效学习紧凑且信息丰富的潜在表示，显著提升目标导向通信的性能。

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了L2C框架，通过元学习优化ADMM-DDP算法的超参数，以适配多任务和多智能体配置，实现了高效协同和动态适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布式轨迹优化方法需要大量手动调整超参数，限制了其在不同任务和配置中的适应性。

Method: L2C通过轻量级神经网络元学习超参数，并利用ADMM-DDP的分布式梯度和Riccati递归加速计算。

Result: 在合作空中运输任务中，L2C生成动态可行的轨迹，适应性强，梯度计算速度比现有方法快88%。

Conclusion: L2C为多智能体协同提供了高效的超参数自适应解决方案，在复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该曲线优化方法在DLP打印中有效提升了复杂几何体的打印质量和效率。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel curve-based slicing method for generating
planar layers with dynamically varying orientations in digital light processing
(DLP) 3D printing. Our approach effectively addresses key challenges in DLP
printing, such as regions with large overhangs and staircase artifacts, while
preserving its intrinsic advantages of high resolution and fast printing
speeds. We formulate the slicing problem as an optimization task, in which
parametric curves are computed to define both the slicing layers and the model
partitioning through their tangent planes. These curves inherently define
motion trajectories for the build platform and can be optimized to meet
critical manufacturing objectives, including collision-free motion and
floating-free deposition. We validate our method through physical experiments
on a robotic multi-axis DLP printing setup, demonstrating that the optimized
curves can robustly guide smooth, high-quality fabrication of complex
geometries.

assistant interacts with the user through voice commands and multimodal
feedback, promoting a more dynamic and engaging shopping experience. The system
was evaluated through experiments, which demonstrated its ability to guide
users effectively and improve their shopping experience. This paper contributes
to the development of inclusive AI-driven assistive technologies aimed at

Abstract: In augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences, a user's arms and hands
can provide a convenient and tactile surface for touch input. Prior work has
shown on-body input to have significant speed, accuracy, and ergonomic benefits
over in-air interfaces, which are common today. In this work, we demonstrate
high accuracy, bare hands (i.e., no special instrumentation of the user) skin
input using just an RGB camera, like those already integrated into all modern
XR headsets. Our results show this approach can be accurate, and robust across
diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (e.g., input while
walking). Finally, our pipeline also provides rich input metadata including
touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation. We believe
these are the requisite technical ingredients to more fully unlock on-skin
interfaces that have been well motivated in the HCI literature but have lacked
robust and practical methods.

TL;DR: 提出了DTPPMP系统，用于实时精确测量油气井深度并在指定位置穿孔，通过动态阈值和物理合理性算法实现高精度，现场测试效果优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 油气资源开发中精确深度测量和穿孔位置是关键挑战，现有设备和操作限制难以满足需求。

Method: 集成于穿孔枪的DTPPMP系统，采用动态阈值和物理合理性算法实时处理CCL信号，嵌入式计算平台实现自主操作。

Result: 四川油田现场测试显示系统穿孔误差小于单孔间隔长度，CCL信号识别F1分数达98.6%。

Conclusion: DTPPMP系统为未来穿孔作业自动化和智能化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate depth measurement is essential for optimizing oil and gas resource
development, as it directly impacts production efficiency. However, achieving
precise depth and perforating at the correct location remains a significant
challenge due to field operational constraints and equipment limitations. In
this work, we propose the Dynamic Threshold and Physical Plausibility Depth
Measurement and Perforation Control (DTPPMP) system, a solution integrated into
perforating guns that enables real-time, precise depth measurement and
perforation at designated perforating intervals. The system autonomously
samples, processes and identifies signals from a casing collar locator (CCL) in
situ within oil and gas wells. Casing collar identification is achieved using a
lightweight dynamic threshold and physical plausibility algorithm deployed on
an embedded platform, which serves as the system's processor. Field tests
conducted in an actual oil well in Sichuan, China, demonstrated the DTPPMP's
ability to accurately identify casing collar signals, measure depths, and
effectively perforate at designated perforating intervals in real-time. The
system achieved a perforation variation of less than the length of a single
perforating interval and a F1 score of 98.6% for casing collar identification.
These results provide valuable recommendations for advancing automation and
intelligence in future perforation operations.

TL;DR: 研究动态无线充电道路（ER）在不同交通条件下的负载频谱特性，揭示其与车辆速度和线圈间距的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态无线充电道路（ER）可以延长电动车（EV）的行驶里程并减小电池尺寸，但充电负载的频谱可能影响电网频率动态，需要深入研究。

Method: 建立EV以恒定速度行驶的统计模型，分析DWPT负载谐波的位置和幅值，并通过交通模拟器验证部分结果。

Result: 谐波基频与ER线圈间距和EV平均速度相关；同步行驶时谐波幅值与EV数量成正比，自由行驶时与EV数量的平方根成正比；车队形式会加剧谐波。

Conclusion: 尽管模型简化，但研究结果为ER规划者和电网运营商提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Electrified roadways (ER) equipped with dynamic wireless power transfer
(DWPT) capabilities can patently extend the driving range and reduce the
battery size of electric vehicles (EVs). However, due to the spatial
arrangement of the transmitter coils in the ER, the DWPT load exhibits
frequency content that could excite power system frequency dynamics. In this
context, this work aims to study the spectrum of DWPT loads under different
traffic conditions. We develop statistical models for EVs moving at constant
speeds to identify the location and magnitude of DWPT load harmonics. Our
analysis reveals that the fundamental frequency is dependent on the ER coil
spacing and the average EV speed. In the worst-case yet unlikely scenario that
EVs move in a synchronized fashion, the amplitude of harmonics scales with the
number of EVs. On the contrary, when EVs move freely, harmonics scale with the
square root of the number of EVs. Platoon formations can accentuate harmonics.
We also show that for higher-order harmonics, the spectral content around
harmonics decreases in magnitude and increases in bandwidth. Despite the
simplified models, our analysis offers valuable insights for ER planners and
grid operators. Numerical tests using a traffic simulator corroborate some of
these insights.

Abstract: Thrust vector control (TVC) is a key mechanism for stabilizing rockets during
flight, yet conventional implementations remain costly and technically
inaccessible to students and hobbyists. This paper presents the design,
fabrication, and testing of a low-cost, 3D-printed, servo-driven
two-dimensional gimbal developed for model rocket applications. The gimbal
underwent more than 60 CAD iterations, with servo selection guided by torque,
response time, and stability requirements. A high-speed camera and Fusion 360
parameter simulations were used to emulate dynamic instability, enabling
evaluation of angular deflection, servo responsiveness, and structural
durability. The results demonstrated stable actuation within plus or minus 5
degrees, with response times on the average order of 44.5 ms, while limitations
included servo fatigue and pin-joint stress under extended loading. The project
highlights the feasibility of student-accessible thrust vector control systems
and their potential as a reproducible platform for STEM education and
experimental aerospace research.

Result: 证明了ROM中的稳定周期性轨道会转化为FOM的动态稳定，并通过仿真验证。

Conclusion: 该框架为ROM在动态步态控制中的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide a powerful means of synthesizing dynamic
walking gaits on legged robots. Yet this approach lacks the formal guarantees
enjoyed by methods that utilize the full-order model (FOM) for gait synthesis,
e.g., hybrid zero dynamics. This paper aims to unify these approaches through a
layered control perspective. In particular, we establish conditions on when a
ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To
achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold
encoding the behavior of the ROM -- controllers can be synthesized that drive
the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable
periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of
the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics. This result is
demonstrated in simulation on a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link
planar walking FOM.

Abstract: Magnetic levitation is poised to revolutionize industrial automation by
integrating flexible in-machine product transport and seamless manipulation. It
is expected to become the standard drive for automated manufacturing. However,
controlling such systems is inherently challenging due to their complex,
unstable dynamics. Traditional control approaches, which rely on hand-crafted
control engineering, typically yield robust but conservative solutions, with
their performance closely tied to the expertise of the engineering team. In
contrast, neural control learning presents a promising alternative. This paper
presents the first neural controller for 6D magnetic levitation. Trained
end-to-end on interaction data from a proprietary controller, it directly maps
raw sensor data and 6D reference poses to coil current commands. The neural
controller can effectively generalize to previously unseen situations while
maintaining accurate and robust control. These results underscore the practical
feasibility of learning-based neural control in complex physical systems and
suggest a future where such a paradigm could enhance or even substitute
traditional engineering approaches in demanding real-world applications. The

Abstract: Reverse parking maneuvers of a vehicle with trailer system is a challenging
task to complete for human drivers due to the unstable nature of the system and
unintuitive controls required to orientate the trailer properly. This paper
hence proposes an optimization-based automation routine to handle the
path-planning and path-tracking control process of such type of maneuvers. The
proposed approach utilizes nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to
robustly guide the vehicle-trailer system into the desired parking space, and
an optional forward repositioning maneuver can be added as an additional stage
of the parking process to obtain better system configurations, before backward
motion can be attempted again to get a good final pose. The novelty of the
proposed approach is the simplicity of its formulation, as the path-planning
and path-tracking operations are only conducted on the trailer being viewed as
a standalone vehicle, before the control inputs are propagated to the tractor
vehicle via inverse kinematic relationships also derived in this paper.
Simulation case studies and hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed, and the
results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro identification method that enhances
the robustness of a centralized multi-quadrotor transportation system. This
method leverages online tuning and learning on decomposed error subspaces,
enabling efficient real-time compensation to time-varying disturbances and
model uncertainties acting on the payload. The strategy is to decompose the
high-dimensional error space into a set of low-dimensional subspaces. In this
way, the identification problem for unseen features is naturally transformed
into submappings (``slices'') addressed by multiple adaptive laws and shallow
neural networks, which are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without
requiring persistent excitation (PE) and offline training. Due to the
model-free nature of neural networks, this approach can be well adapted to
highly coupled and nonlinear centralized transportation systems. It serves as a
feedforward compensator for the payload controller without explicitly relying
on the dynamics coupled with the payload, such as cables and quadrotors. The
proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov,
and its enhanced robustness under time-varying disturbances and model
uncertainties was demonstrated by numerical simulations.

Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro geometric control for a centralized
multi-quadrotor cooperative transportation system, which enhances both
adaptivity and disturbance rejection. Our strategy is to coactively tune the
model parameters and learn the external disturbances in real-time. To realize
this, we augmented the existing geometric control with multiple neural networks
and adaptive laws, where the estimated model parameters and the weights of the
neural networks are simultaneously tuned and adjusted online. The
Lyapunov-based adaptation guarantees bounded estimation errors without
requiring either pre-training or the persistent excitation (PE) condition. The
proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov
under certain preconditions, and its enhanced robustness under scenarios of
disturbed environment and model-unmatched plant was demonstrated by numerical
simulations.

Abstract: Decision-making in automated driving must consider interactions with
surrounding agents to be effective. However, traditional methods often neglect
or oversimplify these interactions because they are difficult to model and
solve, which can lead to overly conservative behavior of the ego vehicle. To
address this gap, we propose two quantum game models, QG-U1 (Quantum Game -
Unitary 1) and QG-G4 (Quantum Game - Gates 4), for interaction-aware
decision-making. These models extend classical game theory by incorporating
principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, interference, and
entanglement. Specifically, QG-U1 and QG-G4 are designed for two-player games
with two strategies per player and can be executed in real time on a standard
computer without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate both models in merging
and roundabout scenarios and compare them with classical game-theoretic methods
and baseline approaches (IDM, MOBIL, and a utility-based technique). Results
show that QG-G4 achieves lower collision rates and higher success rates
compared to baseline methods, while both quantum models yield higher expected
payoffs than classical game approaches under certain parameter settings.

Abstract: The broadcast nature of wireless communication renders it inherently
vulnerable to security threats such as jamming and eavesdropping. While
traditional array beamforming techniques help to mitigate these threats, they
usually incur high hardware and processing costs, particularly in large-scale
arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). In contrast, movable antenna (MA)
arrays can fully exploit the channel variation in spatial regions by enabling
flexible antenna movement, which has emerged as a promising technology for
secure communications. This article provides a magazine-type overview of
MA-aided secure communications. Specifically, we first illuminate the promising
application scenarios for MA-enhanced secure communication systems. Then, we
examine the security advantages of MAs over conventional FPA systems,
fundamentally stemming from their ability to adjust channel correlations
between legitimate users, eavesdroppers, and jammers. Furthermore, we discuss
important technical challenges and their potential solutions related to MA
hardware architecture, channel acquisition, and antenna position optimization
to realize secure transmissions. Finally, several promising directions for
MA-aided secure communications are presented to inspire future research.

Abstract: This paper investigates movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission in
near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, where
the base station (BS) equipped with an MA array transmits confidential
information to a legitimate user under the threat of a potential eavesdropper.
To enhance physical layer security (PLS) of the considered system, we aim to
maximize the secrecy rate by jointly designing the hybrid digital and analog
beamformers, as well as the positions of MAs at the BS. To solve the formulated
non-convex problem with highly coupled variables, an alternating optimization
(AO)-based algorithm is introduced by decoupling the original problem into two
separate subproblems. Specifically, for the subproblem of designing hybrid
beamformers, a semi-closed-form solution for the fully-digital beamformer is
first derived by a weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm.
Subsequently, the digital and analog beamformers are determined by
approximating the fully-digital beamformer through the manifold optimization
(MO) technique. For the MA positions design subproblem, we utilize the
majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to iteratively optimize each MA's
position while keeping others fixed. Extensive simulation results validate the
considerable benefits of the proposed MA-aided near-field beam focusing
approach in enhancing security performance compared to the traditional
far-field and/or the fixed position antenna (FPA)-based systems. In addition,
the proposed scheme can realize secure transmission even if the eavesdropper is
located in the same direction as the user and closer to the BS.

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种名为变形测试（MT）的系统方法，用于测试多模态人类轨迹预测（HTP）系统，通过适应性变形关系解决测试中的预言问题，并提出五个变形关系和概率违反标准。

Conclusion: 该方法为测试多模态随机HTP系统提供了一种无预言依赖的解决方案，有效评估模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and
reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile
robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory
Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g.,
trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs
(multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary
difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future
trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This
research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic
methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem
through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic
nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both
historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an
environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric
transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and
map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2)
Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing
obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose
probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability
distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This
study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of
multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model
robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without
reliance on ground-truth trajectories.
