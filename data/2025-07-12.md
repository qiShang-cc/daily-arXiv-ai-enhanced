### [1] [Three-Dimensional Millimeter-Wave Imaging Using Active Incoherent Fourier Processing and Pulse Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07239)
*Jorge R. Colon-Berrios,Jason M. Merlo,Jeffrey A. Nanzer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合二维空间傅里叶域成像技术和雷达脉冲压缩的三维成像方法，通过噪声信号和LFM信号实现目标的三维重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统雷达技术难以同时获取高分辨率的跨距和降距信息，因此需要一种新的成像方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用四个发射器，其中三个发射空间和时间不相关的噪声信号，另一个发射已知的LFM脉冲信号，通过干涉处理实现跨距成像，同时利用匹配滤波实现降距成像。

Result: 通过模拟和实验数据验证了该技术能够重建目标的三维信息。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了三维成像的需求，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel three-dimensional (3D) imaging approach that combines
two-dimensional spatial Fourier-domain imaging techniques with traditional
radar pulse compression to recover both cross-range and down-range scene
information. The imaging system employs four transmitters, three of which emit
spatially and temporally incoherent noise signals, while the fourth transmits a
known linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulsed signal. The spatial incoherence
of the noise signals enables sampling of the 2D spatial Fourier spectrum of the
scene from which two-dimensional cross-range (azimuth and elevation) images can
be formed via interferometric processing. Simultaneously, the LFM signal
enables high-resolution downrange imaging through matched filtering. The
received signals consist of a superposition of the noise sources and the known
pulse allowing for joint recovery of all three dimensions. We describe the
system architecture and waveform design, and demonstrate the imaging technique
using both simulations with a linear array and experimental data from a 38 GHz
active incoherent millimeter-wave imaging system with 23-element randomized
array. Results show the reconstruction of targets in three dimensions.

### [2] [A RIS-Enabled Computational Radar Coincidence Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07285)
*Kavian Zirak,Mohammadreza F. Imani*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种结合RIS、RCI和计算成像的创新成像方法，通过定向波束生成高SNR的斑点图案，实现高质量成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该方法适用于安全筛查、无线用户跟踪和活动识别。

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative imaging method using reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) by combining radar coincidence imaging (RCI) and
computational imaging techniques. In the proposed framework, RISs
simultaneously redirect beams toward a desired region of interest (ROI). The
interference of these beams forms spatially diverse speckle patterns that carry
information about the entire ROI. As a result, this method can take advantage
of the benefits of both random patterns and spotlight imaging. Since the
speckle pattern is formed by directive beams (instead of random patterns
typically used in computational imaging), this approach results in a higher
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced clutter. In contrast to raster
scanning, which requires the number of measurements to be at least equal to the
number of unknowns, our proposed approach follows a computational imaging
framework and can obtain high-quality images even when only a few measurements
are taken. Using numerical simulation, we demonstrate this method's
capabilities and contrast it against other conventional techniques. The
proposed imaging approach can be applied to security screening, wireless user
tracking, and activity recognition.

Conclusion: 该框架为人群分析应用提供了有效工具，展示了毫米波雷达在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd
motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our
proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts
from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to
generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations
of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these
fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow
currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is
quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian
and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd
semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on
crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity
mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the
underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating
strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow
split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key
crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift,
dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework,
underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI技术在无线通信中的应用，尤其是利用AE生成难以检测和拦截的信号，以提高通信的安全性。

Method: 引入结合KL散度的新损失函数增强信号的无特征性；采用二进制输入替代one-hot输入以支持长消息块，并利用传统纠错编码方案解码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了信号的隐藏性，同时降低了误块率（BLER），验证了其在无线通信中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的AE方法为安全可靠的无线通信系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly autoencoders (AEs),
have gained significant attention in wireless communication systems. This paper
investigates using an AE to generate featureless signals with a low probability
of detection and interception (LPD/LPI). Firstly, we introduce a novel loss
function that adds a KL divergence term to the categorical cross entropy,
enhancing the noise like characteristics of AE-generated signals while
preserving block error rate (BLER). Secondly, to support long source message
blocks for the AE's inputs, we replace one-hot inputs of source blocks with
binary inputs pre-encoded by conventional error correction coding schemes. The
AE's outputs are then decoded back to the source blocks using the same scheme.
This design enables the AE to learn the coding structure, yielding superior
BLER performance on coded blocks and the BLER of the source blocks is further
decreased by the error correction decoder. Moreover, we also validate the AE
based communication system in the over-the-air communication. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the featureless
properties of AE signals and significantly reduce the BLER of message blocks,
underscoring the promise of our AE-based approach for secure and reliable
wireless communication systems.

### [5] [Leveraging Power Amplifier Distortion for Physical Layer Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07567)
*Reza Ghasemi Alavicheh,Thomas Feys,MD Arifur Rahman,François Rottenberg*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 利用功放非线性失真实现物理层安全，Z3RO预编码器将失真导向非用户位置以提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理层安全技术通过注入与合法信道正交的人工噪声增强安全性，而本研究发现功放非线性失真这一通常被认为是不利的特性可以用于提升安全性。

Method: 提出Z3RO预编码器，通过对多个天线施加负极性，在用户位置抵消功放失真，使失真传输至非用户位置，为潜在窃听者制造干扰。

Result: 仿真显示，Z3RO预编码器在10%中断概率、32 dB SNR和-5 dB IBO条件下，保密速率比传统MRT预编码提升2.5倍。

Conclusion: 功放非线性失真可作为提升物理层安全性的有效工具，Z3RO预编码器在特定条件下表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to physical layer security (PLS) by
leveraging power amplifier (PA) nonlinear distortion through distortion-aware
precoding. While some conventional PLS techniques inject artificial noise
orthogonal to legitimate channels, we demonstrate that inherent PA
nonlinearities typically considered undesirable can be exploited to enhance
security. The zero 3rd order (Z3RO) precoder applies a negative polarity to
several antennas to cancel the PA distortion at the user location, resulting in
distortion being transmitted in non-user locations. Redirecting the distortion
to non-user locations creates interference for potential eavesdroppers,
lowering their signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR). Numerical
simulations reveal that the Z3RO precoder achieves up to a $2.5\times$
improvement in secrecy rate compared to conventional maximum ratio transmission
(MRT) precoding under a $10\%$ outage probability, SNR of $32$ dB and $-5$ dB
input back-off (IBO) where the PAs enter the saturation regime.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在工业物联网（IIoT）中，通过可重构智能表面（RIS）辅助的集成传感与通信（ISAC）系统，实现在近场和远场共存场景下的高效传感与通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业6.0的实现需要高效的IIoT技术支持，而ISAC在实时控制和自动化中起关键作用。研究旨在解决近场和远场共存时的频谱效率与传感精度问题。

Method: 采用RIS辅助的ISAC系统，结合全双工接入点（AP）和多设备配置，使用传统传感频段和ISAC频段提升效率。通过NOMA技术和SCA-AO算法优化RIS相位、带宽分配和波束成形。

Conclusion: 论文提出的RIS辅助ISAC系统为IIoT提供了高效的频谱利用率和传感精度，推动了工业6.0的发展。

Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has emerged as a key technology for
realizing the vision of Industry 6.0, requiring the seamless integration of
diverse connected devices. In particular, integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) plays a critical role in supporting real-time control and automation
within IIoT systems. In this paper, we explore reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted ISAC systems for IIoT in the coexistence of near-field
and far-field regions. The system consists of a full-duplex access point (AP),
a RIS and multiple IIoT devices, where the near-field devices simultaneously
perform sensing and communication, while the far-field devices rely on a
RIS-assisted communication. To enhance spectral efficiency for both sensing and
communication functionalities, we consider the use of both traditional
sensing-only (SO) and ISAC frequency bands. Moreover, uplink non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) is employed to facilitate the sequential decoding of
superimposed communication and sensing signals from IIoT devices. To maximize
sensing accuracy in terms of Cram${\Grave{\textrm{e}}}$r-Rao bound (CRB), we
formulate a joint optimization of RIS phase shift, bandwidth splitting ratio
and receive beamforming vector subject to the minimum data rate requirements of
IIoT devices and resource budget constraints. The algorithmic solution is
developed via the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based alternating
optimization (AO) method with the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms conventional methods relying solely on either ISAC or SO band by
achieving superior performance across RIS and device configurations, while
ensuring robust ISAC performance under the near-field and far-field coexistence
scenarios.

### [7] [Consistent and Asymptotically Efficient Localization from Bearing-only Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07647)
*Shenghua Hu,Guangyang Zeng,Wenchao Xue,Haitao Fang,Biqiang Mu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了基于纯方位测量的信号源定位问题，提出了一个低计算复杂度且具有与最大似然估计相同渐近特性的两步估计器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决最大似然估计在非凸优化问题中的计算挑战，同时保持其渐近有效性和一致性。

Method: 通过构建线性最小二乘问题和代数运算获得初步一致估计器，然后通过高斯-牛顿迭代实现与最大似然估计相同的渐近性能。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该两步估计器在大样本量下性能优越。

Conclusion: 提出的两步估计器在计算效率和渐近性能上优于传统方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of signal source localization using bearing-only
measurements. Initially, we present easily verifiable geometric conditions for
sensor deployment to ensure the asymptotic identifiability of the model and
demonstrate the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood
(ML) estimator. However, obtaining the ML estimator is challenging due to its
association with a non-convex optimization problem. To address this, we propose
a two-step estimator that shares the same asymptotic properties as the ML
estimator while offering low computational complexity, linear in the number of
measurements. The primary challenge lies in obtaining a preliminary consistent
estimator in the first step. To achieve this, we construct a linear
least-squares problem through algebraic operations on the measurement nonlinear
model to first obtain a biased closed-form solution. We then eliminate the bias
using the data to yield an asymptotically unbiased and consistent estimator.
The key to this process is obtaining a consistent estimator of the variance of
the sine of the noise by taking the reciprocal of the maximum eigenvalue of a
specially constructed matrix from the data. In the second step, we perform a
single Gauss-Newton iteration using the preliminary consistent estimator as the
initial value, achieving the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator.
Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed two-step estimator for large sample sizes.

Abstract: Tactile Internet (TI) requires achieving ultra-low latency and highly
reliable packet delivery for haptic signals. In the presence of packet loss and
delay, the signal prediction method provides a viable solution for recovering
the missing signals. To this end, we introduce the Leader-Follower (LeFo)
approach based on a cooperative Stackelberg game, which enables both users and
robots to learn and predict actions. With accurate prediction, the
teleoperation system can safely relax its strict delay requirements. Our method
achieves high prediction accuracy, ranging from 80.62% to 95.03% for remote
robot signals at the Human ($H$) side and from 70.44% to 89.77% for human
operation signals at the remote Robot ($R$) side. We also establish an upper
bound for maximum signal loss using Taylor Expansion, ensuring robustness.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable and low-latency communication in offshore wind farms is
critical for efficient monitoring and control, yet remains challenging due to
the harsh environment and lack of infrastructure. This paper investigates a
flying base station (FBS) approach for wide-area monitoring and control in the
UK Hornsea offshore wind farm project. By leveraging mobile, flexible FBS
platforms in the remote and harsh offshore environment, the proposed system
offers real-time connectivity for turbines without the need for deploying
permanent infrastructure at the sea. We develop a detailed and practical
end-to-end latency model accounting for five key factors: flight duration,
connection establishment, turbine state information upload, computational
delay, and control transmission, to provide a holistic perspective often
missing in prior studies. Furthermore, we combine trajectory planning,
beamforming, and resource allocation into a multi-objective optimization
framework for the overall latency minimization, specifically designed for
large-scale offshore wind farm deployments. Simulation results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed method in minimizing latency and enhancing
efficiency in FBS-assisted offshore monitoring across various power levels,
while consistently outperforming baseline designs.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了针对具有相位相关振幅（PDA）和离散相位偏移的RIS（可重构智能表面）的优化算法，通过线性时间收敛的搜索方法和量化框架（APQ/EAPQ）最大化用户设备的接收功率。

Conclusion: 该算法为RIS在振幅和相位限制下的优化提供了高效解决方案，并量化了性能与参数的关系。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the received power at a user
equipment via reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) characterized by
phase-dependent amplitude (PDA) and discrete phase shifts over a limited phase
range. Given complex RIS coefficients, that is, discrete phase shifts and PDAs,
we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the optimal
solution. To this end, we propose an optimal search algorithm that is proven to
converge in linear time within at most NK steps, significantly outperforming
the exhaustive search approach that would otherwise be needed for RISs with
amplitude attenuation. Furthermore, we introduce a practical quantization
framework for PDA-introduced RISs termed amplitude-introduced polar
quantization (APQ), and extend it to a novel algorithm named extended
amplitude-introduced polar quantization (EAPQ) that works with geometric
projections. We derive closed-form expressions to assess how closely the
performance of the proposed RIS configuration can approximate the ideal case
with continuous phases and no attenuation. Our analysis reveals that increasing
the number of discrete phases beyond K = 4 yields only marginal gains,
regardless of attenuation levels, provided the RIS has a sufficiently wide
phase range R. Furthermore, we also show and quantify that when the phase range
R is limited, the performance is sensitive to attenuation for larger R, and
sensitive to R when there is less attenuation. Finally, the proposed optimal
algorithm provides a generic upper bound that could serve as a benchmark for
discrete beamforming in RISs with amplitude constraints.

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法提升了多个语音任务的性能，同时保持了增强信号的感知质量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了语音增强模型的通用性问题，并能显著提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Single-channel speech enhancement is utilized in various tasks to mitigate
the effect of interfering signals. Conventionally, to ensure the speech
enhancement performs optimally, the speech enhancement has needed to be tuned
for each task. Thus, generalizing speech enhancement models to unknown
downstream tasks has been challenging. This study aims to construct a generic
speech enhancement front-end that can improve the performance of back-ends to
solve multiple downstream tasks. To this end, we propose a novel training
criterion that minimizes the distance between the enhanced and the ground truth
clean signal in the feature representation domain of self-supervised learning
models. Since self-supervised learning feature representations effectively
express high-level speech information useful for solving various downstream
tasks, the proposal is expected to make speech enhancement models preserve such
information. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposal improves
the performance of multiple speech tasks while maintaining the perceptual
quality of the enhanced signal.

Motivation: 光OFDM与PCS的结合虽能提升系统性能，但会意外增加信号的PAPR，加剧削波失真。研究其影响并提出优化方案是必要的。

Method: 提出了一种基于投影梯度下降的次优但高效的优化方法，以解决PCS与光OFDM结合时的非凸优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的方法在严重削波条件下优于传统的均匀信号处理。

Conclusion: 优化后的PCS能够在考虑削波失真的情况下有效提升信道容量，尤其在恶劣条件下表现更佳。

Abstract: Optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and probabilistic
constellation shaping (PCS) have emerged as powerful techniques to enhance the
performance of optical wireless communications (OWC) systems. While PCS
improves spectral efficiency and adaptability, we show that its integration
with optical OFDM can inadvertently increase the peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) of the signal, exacerbating clipping distortion due to signal clipping.
This letter investigates the impact of PCS on the PAPR of direct current-biased
optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) waveforms and proposes an optimization of PCS that
maximizes channel capacity, considering clipping distortion. The optimization
problem is shown to be complex and non-convex. We thus present a suboptimal yet
efficient solving approach based on projected gradient descent to solve the
problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
approach over the conventional uniform signaling, particularly under severe
clipping distortion conditions.

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.
