To fully exploit this flexible configuration, the\nacquisition of individual channel state information (CSI) is essential.\nHowever, due to the passive nature of the RIS, cascaded channel estimation is\nperformed, as the RIS itself lacks signal processing capabilities. This entails\nestimating the CSI for all $M \\times M$ switch array permutations, resulting in\na total of $M!$ possible configurations, to identify the optimal one that\nmaximizes the channel gain. This process leads to long uplink training\nintervals, which degrade spectral efficiency and increase uplink energy\nconsumption.

Recent advances in MoE have facilitated its adoption in wireless\nnetworks to address the increasing complexity and heterogeneity of modern\ncommunication systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the MoE\nframework in wireless networks, highlighting its potential in optimizing\nresource efficiency, improving scalability, and enhancing adaptability across\ndiverse network tasks. We first introduce the fundamental concepts of MoE,\nincluding various gating mechanisms and the integration with generative AI\n(GenAI) and reinforcement learning (RL). Subsequently, we discuss the extensive\napplications of MoE across critical wireless communication scenarios, such as\nvehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite communications,\nheterogeneous networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and mobile\nedge networks. Furthermore, key applications in channel prediction, physical\nlayer signal processing, radio resource management, network optimization, and\nsecurity are thoroughly examined. Additionally, we present a detailed overview\nof open-source datasets that are widely used in MoE-based models to support\ndiverse machine learning tasks. Finally, this survey identifies crucial future\nresearch directions for MoE, emphasizing the importance of advanced training\ntechniques, resource-aware gating strategies, and deeper integration with\nemerging 6G technologies."}
