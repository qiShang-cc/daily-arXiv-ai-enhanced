The framework supports 2D and 3D positioning using received\nsignal strength (RSS) from pilot transmissions, enhanced by the radical axis\ntheorem to improve accuracy under measurement uncertainties. Communication is\nachieved using spatial modulation (SM) with M-ary pulse amplitude modulation\n(PAM), where data is conveyed through the modulation symbol and the active\nlight-emitting diode (LED) index, improving spectral efficiency while\nmaintaining low complexity. A pilot-aided least squares (LS) estimator is\nemployed for joint channel and dimming coefficient estimation, enabling robust\nsymbol detection in multipath environments characterized by both line-of-sight\n(LOS) and diffuse non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components, modeled using Rician\nfading. The proposed system incorporates a dimming control mechanism to meet\nlighting requirements while maintaining reliable communication and positioning\nperformance. Simulation results demonstrate sub-centimeter localization\naccuracy at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and bit error rates (BERs) below\n10^{-6} for low-order PAM schemes. Additionally, comparative analysis across\nuser locations reveals that positioning and communication performance improve\nsignificantly near the geometric center of the LED layout. These findings\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed system for future 6G indoor networks\nrequiring integrated localization and communication under practical channel\nconditions."}

These are well suited to\ncapture average behavior across many statistical realizations, but cannot\nreproduce site-specific phenomena such as corner diffraction, street-canyon\nblockage, or deterministic line-of-sight conditions and\nangle-of-departure/arrival relationships that drive directional links. This\npaper extends 5G-LENA, an NR module for the system-level Network Simulator 3\n(ns-3), with a trace-based channel model that processes the Multipath\nComponents (MPCs) obtained from external ray-tracers (e.g., Sionna Ray Tracer\n(RT)) or measurement campaigns. Our module constructs frequency-domain channel\nmatrices and feeds them to the existing Physical (PHY)/Medium Access Control\n(MAC) stack without any further modifications. The result is a geometry-based\nchannel model that remains fully compatible with the standard 3GPP\nimplementation in 5G-LENA, while delivering site-specific geometric fidelity.\nThis new module provides a key building block toward Digital Twin (DT)\ncapabilities by offering realistic site-specific channel modeling, unlocking\nstudies that require site awareness, including beam management, blockage\nmitigation, and environment-aware sensing. We demonstrate its capabilities for\nprecise beam-steering validation and end-to-end metric analysis.

A particular challenge arises in\nscenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as\nthese parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since\nparked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information\nobtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately\nreflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.\nTo address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization\nframework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud\n(PCD) data.

To address these issues, this study proposes\na foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,\nnamed MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,\nencompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter\nsecurity, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset\nsignals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a\nself-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of\nDAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition\ntasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes\nonly a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the\nTransformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super\nplatform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The\nVPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%\nof parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)\nmethod by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits\nrobust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,\nefficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach\noffers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal\nrecognition models in the DAS domain."}
