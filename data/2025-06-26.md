### [1] [A Multi-Modal Spatial Risk Framework for EV Charging Infrastructure Using Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19860)

Result: 原型展示了多源数据融合和可解释空间推理在支持气候韧性和基础设施感知的电动汽车部署中的价值。

Conclusion: RSERI-EV框架通过多源数据融合和空间分析，为电动汽车充电站的韧性评估提供了可行且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to
sustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and
infrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce
RSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that
combines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph
analytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV
integrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface
temperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover
(LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate
a composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales
EV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest
neighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable
neighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype
highlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial
reasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.

### [2] [Revisiting R: Statistical Envelope Analysis for Lightweight RF Modulation Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19956)
*Srinivas Rahul Sapireddy,Mostafizur Rahman*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文重新探讨了R值在调制分类中的应用，并通过统计方法和信号变换（Hilbert变换和STFT）显著提高了分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调制分类在无线通信系统中至关重要，但传统方法计算成本高。研究旨在改进1985年提出的R值方法，以更高效地实现分类。

Method: 扩展R值分析，结合Hilbert变换和STFT处理信号，并测试30万组信号（AM、DSB、SSB各10万组）。

Result: 分类准确率显著提升：Hilbert变换后AM、DSB、SSB分别达到98.6%、97.3%、97.9%；STFT后进一步提高至98.8%、99.1%、99.0%。

Conclusion: R值结合统计方法和信号变换能够高效实现调制分类，验证了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Modulation classification plays a crucial role in wireless communication
systems, enabling applications such as cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring,
and electronic warfare. Conventional techniques often involve deep learning or
complex feature extraction, which, while effective, require substantial
computational resources and memory. An early approach by Chan and Gadbois in
1985 introduced a theoretical method for modulation classification using a
mathematically derived parameter called R. The authors proved that the R value
- the ratio of the variance to the square of the mean of the signal envelope -
can be a distinguishing feature for classification. In this work, we revisit
the R value and show that classification accuracy can be improved further
through statistical methods. We extend R-value analysis to demonstrate its
effectiveness even after signals are transformed using the Hilbert transform
followed by the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Our analysis includes
testing on 300000 signals across AM, DSB, and SSB classes, with each class
having 100000 random variations. On average, we achieve 98.60, 97.30, and 97.90
percent classification accuracy for AM, DSB, and SSB signals after applying the
Hilbert transform. Similar or better accuracies are observed after applying the
STFT, reaching 98.80, 99.10, and 99.00 percent, respectively, for AM, DSB, and
SSB types.

### [3] [Posterior Cramér-Rao Bounds on Localization and Mapping Errors in Distributed MIMO SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19957)
*Benjamin J. B. Deutschmann,Xuhong Li,Florian Meyer,Erik Leitinger*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了RF-SLAM中的映射误差界限（MEB），用于评估镜面反射表面的位置和方向的后验Cramér-Rao下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献缺乏对地图信息性能界限的研究，本文旨在填补这一空白，特别是在多路径信道中的非视距分量利用方面。

Method: 通过推导后验Cramér-Rao下界，考虑了单次和双次反射以及分布式锚点的通用场景。

Result: 数值实验表明，最先进的RF-SLAM算法能够渐进收敛到MEB，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MEB不仅可以评估定位性能，还能评估RF-SLAM算法在全局特征上的映射性能。

Abstract: Radio-frequency simultaneous localization and mapping (RF-SLAM) methods
jointly infer the position of mobile transmitters and receivers in wireless
networks, together with a geometric map of the propagation environment. An
inferred map of specular surfaces can be used to exploit non-line-of-sight
components of the multipath channel to increase robustness, bypass
obstructions, and improve overall communication and positioning performance.
While performance bounds for user location are well established, the literature
lacks performance bounds for map information. This paper derives the mapping
error bound (MEB), i.e., the posterior Cram\'er-Rao lower bound on the position
and orientation of specular surfaces, for RF-SLAM. In particular, we consider a
very general scenario with single- and double-bounce reflections, as well as
distributed anchors. We demonstrate numerically that a state-of-the-art RF-SLAM
algorithm asymptotically converges to this MEB. The bounds assess not only the
localization (position and orientation) but also the mapping performance of
RF-SLAM algorithms in terms of global features.

### [4] [Near-Field SWIPT Using XL-MIMO: Power Allocation and Subarray Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20050)
*Muhammad Zeeshan Mumtaz,Mohammadali Mohammadi,Hien Quoc Ngo,Michail Matthaiou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了XL-MIMO系统中无线信息与能量同时传输（SWIPT）的功率消耗效率，提出了一种联合优化方法，显著降低了系统功率消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 所提方法在满足服务质量约束的同时，显著提升了XL-MIMO系统的能效。

Abstract: This paper investigates the simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) capability of a modular extremely large multiple-input
multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system, in the context of power consumption (PC)
efficiency. The network users are divided into two functional categories:
information decoding (ID) users and energy harvesting (EH) users.
Non-stationary near-field channels are considered whilst the users are located
in spatially distinct visibility regions (VRs). We formulate a two-tier joint
optimization problem to minimize the PC, taking into account the power
allocation (PA) for ID and EH users, along with the activation of constituent
XL-MIMO subarrays. This complicated mixed-integer problem is transformed into
more tractable formulations and efficient algorithms are proposed for solving
them. The numerical results demonstrate that the overall PC of the XL-MIMO
system for the proposed method is reduced by more than 60% in comparison to the
benchmark scheme of equal PA with full subarray activation (SA) and 30% against
the case of optimized PA with full SA, while satisfying the quality-of-service
(QoS) constraints on both the downlink rate of the ID users and harvested
energy at the EH users.

### [5] [Near-Field Energy Harvesting Using XL-MIMO Over Non-Stationary Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20067)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 采用多层联合优化框架和分数规划技术，动态选择子阵列开闭及功率分配。

Result: 所提算法HPE性能接近最优，比基准方案提升120%且显著减少计算时间。

Conclusion: 该优化方法在能量收集效率和计算效率上均表现出色，优于传统方法。

Abstract: This paper explores the maximization of the harvested power efficiency (HPE)
in a modular extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system,
which supports energy harvesting (EH) for near-field users. These users are
located in spatially distinct visibility regions (VRs) with non-stationary
channel characteristics. We propose to determine which sub-arrays are switched
on or off as well the power control coefficients at the sub-arrays to maximize
the HPE. The design can be processed via a multi-tier joint optimization
framework based on fractional programming. The numerical results showcase that
the HPE performance of the proposed algorithm is nearly optimal, comparable to
that of exhaustive search. As a matter of fact, it achieves up to a 120% gain
over the benchmark scheme which uses the entire XL-MIMO array with equal power
allocation (PA) across sub-arrays, while significantly reducing the
computational time.

### [6] [Low-Complexity Ordered Reliability Direct Error Pattern Testing (ORDEPT) Decoding with Likelihood Thresholding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20079)
*Reza Hadavian,Dmitri Truhachev*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种降低复杂度的基于模式的软译码方法，通过早期终止准则减少延时和复杂度，同时保持相同的块错误率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法的复杂度和时延较高，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 基于ORDEPT算法，引入早期终止准则，在候选码字的对数似然差低于预设阈值时立即做出译码决策。

Result: 在保持相同BLER性能的同时，算法的延时和复杂度显著低于现有技术。

Conclusion: 所提方法在性能和效率上优于现有算法。

Abstract: We propose a reduced complexity approach to pattern-based soft decoding of
block codes. We start from the ORDEPT decoding algorithm which tests a list of
partial error patterns organized in the order of their likelihood and attempts
to complete the patterns creating candidate codewords. We then propose an early
termination criterion. Once a candidate codeword is found, its log-likelihood
difference to the received sequence is compared to a preset threshold and the
decoding decision is instantly made in case the likelihood deviation is below
the threshold. We demonstrate that while keeping the same block error rate
(BLER) performance, the proposed algorithm's latency and complexity is multiple
times smaller than that of the state-of-the art competitors including the Chase
II, ORBGRAND, GCD, and the very recent ORDEPT with Soft-Output GRAND
termination which necessitates several multiplications in each query
processing.

### [7] [Joint Quantization and Pruning Neural Networks Approach: A Case Study on FSO Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20084)

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了计算复杂度，同时保持了性能，适用于实时且资源受限的自由空间光通信系统。

Abstract: Towards fast, hardware-efficient, and low-complexity receivers, we propose a
compression-aware learning approach and examine it on free-space optical (FSO)
receivers for turbulence mitigation. The learning approach jointly quantize,
prune, and train a convolutional neural network (CNN). In addition, we propose
to have the CNN weights of power of two values so we replace the multiplication
operations bit-shifting operations in every layer that has significant lower
computational cost. The compression idea in the proposed approach is that the
loss function is updated and both the quantization levels and the pruning
limits are optimized in every epoch of training. The compressed CNN is examined
for two levels of compression (1-bit and 2-bits) over different FSO systems.
The numerical results show that the compression approach provides negligible
decrease in performance in case of 1-bit quantization and the same performance
in case of 2-bits quantization, compared to the full-precision CNNs. In
general, the proposed IM/DD FSO receivers show better bit-error rate (BER)
performance (without the need for channel state information (CSI)) compared to
the maximum likelihood (ML) receivers that utilize imperfect CSI when the DL
model is compressed whether with 1-bit or 2-bit quantization.

### [8] [Sensing-Aware Transmit Waveform/Receive Filter Design for OFDM-MBS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20231)

Conclusion: 所提方案能有效降低旁瓣电平，提升雷达检测性能，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: In this letter, we study the problem of cooperative sensing design for an
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple base stations (MBS)
system. We consider a practical scenario where the base stations (BSs) exploit
certain subcarriers to realize a sensing function. Since the high sidelobe
level (SLL) of OFDM waveforms degrades radar detection for weak targets, and
the cross-correlation generated by other BSs further exacerbates detection
performance, we devise a joint design scheme for OFDM sequence and receive
filter by minimizing the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) while satisfying
mainlobe level, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and spectrum allocation
constraints. To address this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating
optimization (AO)-based algorithm. Numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the superiority of SSL
reduction in the MBS system over the matched filtering method.

Result: 方法在合成数据实验中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 极化正则化为双变量信号重建提供了一种新颖且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In many applications and physical phenomena, bivariate signals are polarized,
i.e. they trace an elliptical trajectory over time when viewed in the 2D planes
of their two components. The smooth evolution of this elliptical trajectory,
called polarization ellipse, is highly informative to solve ill-posed inverse
problems involving bivariate signals where the signal is collected through
indirect, noisy or incomplete measurements. This work proposes a novel
formulation and an efficient algorithm for reconstructing bivariate signals
with polarization regularization. The proposed formulation leverages the
compact representation of polarization through the instantaneous covariance
matrices. To address the resulting quartic optimization problem, we propose a
well-suited parameter splitting strategy which leads to an efficient iterative
algorithm (alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)) with convex
subproblems at each iteration. The performance of the proposed method is
illustrated on numerical synthetic data experiments.

### [10] [Superimposed DMRS for Spectrally Efficient 6G Uplink Multi-User OFDM: Classical vs AI/ML Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20248)
*Sajad Rezaie,Mikko Honkala,Dani Korpi,Dick Carrillo Melgarejo,Tomasz Izydorczyk,Dimitri Gold,Oana-Elena Barbu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度卷积神经网络（CNN）的接收器DeepRx，用于在5G/6G系统中处理叠加的DMRS符号，以提高信道估计和数据检测性能，相比传统方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G系统中正交DMRS虽然避免了干扰，但占据了大量资源。为支持6G系统的高效数据传输，研究如何通过叠加数据与DMRS符号来减少资源开销。

Method: 提出DeepRx，一种基于CNN的接收器，可直接从叠加的DMRS符号中估计信道并检测数据，同时设计了传统接收器作为对比。

Result: 实验表明，DeepRx在单用户和多用户场景中均显著优于传统接收器。

Conclusion: DeepRx为6G系统中的DMRS传输提供了高效解决方案，通过深度学习技术提升了性能。

Abstract: Fifth-generation (5G) systems utilize orthogonal demodulation reference
signals (DMRS) to enable channel estimation at the receiver. These orthogonal
DMRS-also referred to as pilots-are effective in avoiding pilot contamination
and interference from both the user's own data and that of others. However,
this approach incurs a significant overhead, as a substantial portion of the
time-frequency resources must be reserved for pilot transmission. Moreover, the
overhead increases with the number of users and transmission layers.
  To address these limitations in the context of emerging sixth-generation (6G)
systems and to support data transmission across the entire time-frequency grid,
the superposition of data and DMRS symbols has been explored as an alternative
DMRS transmission strategy. In this study, we propose an enhanced version of
DeepRx, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based receiver, capable of
estimating the channel from received superimposed (SI) DMRS symbols and
reliably detecting the transmitted data. We also design a conventional receiver
for comparison, which estimates the channel from SI DMRS using classical signal
processing techniques. Extensive evaluations in both uplink single-user and
multi-user scenarios demonstrate that DeepRx consistently outperforms the
conventional receivers in terms of performance.

### [11] [Analog OFDM based on Real-Time Fourier Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20287)
*Xiaolu Yang,Oscar Céspedes Vicente,Christophe Caloz*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于实时傅里叶变换（RTFT）的模拟正交频分复用（OFDM）架构，利用线性啁啾相位器实现频时映射，替代传统数字FFT/IFFT，模拟系统数学等效于数字OFDM系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统数字OFDM系统中FFT/IFFT处理器的高功耗问题，探索模拟域实现高速、宽带和节能的无线通信平台。

Method: 使用具有相反群延迟色散的线性啁啾相位器实现RTFT，通过模拟频时映射生成OFDM信号，理论分析和仿真验证其等效性。

Conclusion: 为全模拟或混合模拟-数字OFDM系统奠定了基础，有望用于下一代高速、宽带和节能的无线通信平台。

Abstract: This paper proposes an analog orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) architecture based on the real-time Fourier transform (RTFT). The core
enabling component is a linear-chirp phaser with engineered group velocity
dispersion (GVD), which realizes RTFT and performs frequency-to-time mapping in
the analog domain. In this architecture, conventional digital fast Fourier
transform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) processors are replaced by two
linear-chirp phasers with opposite group delay dispersions, respectively.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under specific phaser conditions, the
OFDM signal generated by the RTFT-based analog system is mathematically
equivalent to that of a conventional digital OFDM system. This equivalence is
further supported by simulation results, which confirm accurate symbol
transmission and recovery, as well as robustness to multipath fading when a
prefix is applied. Benefiting from the use of passive microwave components, the
analog OFDM system offers ultra-fast processing with reduced power consumption.
Overall, this work establishes a foundation for fully analog or hybrid
analog-digital OFDM system, offering a promising solution for next-generation
high-speed, wideband, and energy-efficient wireless communication platforms.

### [12] [OLALa: Online Learned Adaptive Lattice Codes for Heterogeneous Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20297)
*Natalie Lang,Maya Simhi,Nir Shlezinger*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为OLALa的异构联邦学习框架，通过在线学习自适应调整量化器，优化通信效率和学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中高维模型更新的通信开销大，现有固定量化方法在异构动态环境中表现不佳。

Method: 提出OLALa框架，允许客户端通过轻量本地计算在线调整量化器，并设计在线学习算法优化量化参数。

Result: 理论分析显示自适应量化可收紧收敛边界，实验表明OLALa在多种量化率下优于传统方法。

Conclusion: OLALa通过动态调整量化器有效提升了联邦学习的性能，适用于异构环境。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across distributed
clients without sharing raw data, often at the cost of substantial
communication overhead induced by transmitting high-dimensional model updates.
This overhead can be alleviated by having the clients quantize their model
updates, with dithered lattice quantizers identified as an attractive scheme
due to its structural simplicity and convergence-preserving properties.
However, existing lattice-based FL schemes typically rely on a fixed
quantization rule, which is suboptimal in heterogeneous and dynamic
environments where the model updates distribution varies across users and
training rounds. In this work, we propose Online Learned Adaptive Lattices
(OLALa), a heterogeneous FL framework where each client can adjust its
quantizer online using lightweight local computations. We first derive
convergence guarantees for FL with non-fixed lattice quantizers and show that
proper lattice adaptation can tighten the convergence bound. Then, we design an
online learning algorithm that enables clients to tune their quantizers
throughout the FL process while exchanging only a compact set of quantization
parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that OLALa consistently improves
learning performance under various quantization rates, outperforming
conventional fixed-codebook and non-adaptive schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过无人机实现量子通信链路的设计和优化需要克服多种物理损伤，而现有方法往往忽略了窄光束条件下的准确建模。

Method: 引入基于网格的光子捕获概率近似方法，并结合物理损伤因素（如大气衰减、湍流等），推导量子密钥生成率和误码率的解析表达式。

Result: 研究表明，实现Mbps级密钥速率和低误码率（QBER <10^-3）需要光束直径小于10厘米和亚毫弧度的跟踪精度。接收器视场角的动态调节对平衡背景噪声和失准容限至关重要。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代机载量子通信系统的设计、优化和部署提供了准确且可操作的工具。

Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive analytical framework for modeling and
performance evaluation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-to-ground quantum
communication links, incorporating key physical impairments such as beam
divergence, pointing errors at both transmitter and receiver, atmospheric
attenuation, turbulence-induced fading, narrow field-of-view (FoV) filtering,
and background photon noise. To overcome the limitations of conventional
wide-beam assumptions, we introduce a grid-based approximation for photon
capture probability that remains accurate under tightly focused beams.
Analytical expressions are derived for the quantum key generation rate and
quantum bit error rate (QBER), enabling fast and reliable system-level
evaluation. Our results reveal that secure quantum key distribution (QKD) over
UAV-based free-space optical (FSO) links requires beam waists below 10 cm and
sub-milliradian tracking precision to achieve Mbps-level key rates and QBER
below $10^{-3}$. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of receiver FoV
in balancing background noise rejection and misalignment tolerance, and propose
adaptive FoV tuning strategies under varying illumination and alignment
conditions. The proposed framework provides a tractable and accurate tool for
the design, optimization, and deployment of next-generation airborne quantum
communication systems.

Abstract: In this letter, we study an active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)
assisted Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications under non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) scenarios, where the active RIS is deployed to create visual
line-of-sight links for reliable communication. To address the challenges of
high energy consumption caused by frequent beamforming updates in active RIS,
we propose a three-timescale optimization framework that jointly designs the
transmit beamforming, RIS beamforming, and RIS direction vectors based on their
characteristics. The goal is to maximize the system achievable rate while
reducing energy consumption by controlling the RIS beamforming switching
frequency. Then, a two-layer solution framework is developed, incorporating
fractional programming (FP), alternating optimization (AO), successive
approximation (SCA), and penalty-based methods, to obtain the optimized
solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can
effectively improve system performance and reduce the energy consumption of the
active RIS.

Abstract: This paper revisits the CHAMPAGNE algorithm within the Sparse Bayesian

coding. We demonstrate that the SBL objective can be reformulated as a
reweighted $\ell_{21}$-minimization problem, providing a more straightforward
interpretation of the sparsity mechanism and enabling the design of an
efficient iterative algorithm. Additionally, we analyze the behavior of this
reformulation in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, showing that it
simplifies to a weighted $\ell_{21}$-regularized least squares problem.
Numerical experiments validate the proposed approach, highlighting its improved
computational efficiency and ability to produce exact sparse solutions,
particularly in simulated MEG source localization tasks.

Abstract: Recent developments in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are laying the
groundwork for innovative applications across the healthcare sector.
Nanodevices designed to operate within the body, managed remotely via the
internet, are envisioned to promptly detect and actuate on potential diseases.
In this vision, an inherent challenge arises due to the limited capabilities of
individual nanosensors; specifically, nanosensors must communicate with one
another to collaborate as a cluster. Aiming to research the boundaries of the
clustering capabilities, this survey emphasizes data-driven communication
strategies in molecular communication (MC) channels as a means of linking
nanosensors. Relying on the flexibility and robustness of machine learning (ML)
methods to tackle the dynamic nature of MC channels, the MC research community
frequently refers to neural network (NN) architectures. This interdisciplinary
research field encompasses various aspects, including the use of NNs to
facilitate communication in MC environments, their implementation at the
nanoscale, explainable approaches for NNs, and dataset generation for training.
Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of fundamental
perspectives on recent trends in NN architectures for MC, the feasibility of
their implementation at the nanoscale, applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) techniques, and the accessibility of datasets along with
best practices for their generation. Additionally, we offer open-source code
repositories that illustrate NN-based methods to support reproducible research
for key MC scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging research challenges, such
as robust NN architectures, biologically integrated NN modules, and scalable
training strategies.

Abstract: The emergence of 6G wireless networks promises to revolutionize vehicular
communications by enabling ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-capacity data
exchange. In this context, collaborative perception techniques, where multiple
vehicles or infrastructure nodes cooperate to jointly receive and decode
transmitted signals, aim to enhance reliability and spectral efficiency for
Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) applications. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end wireless neural receiver based on a Differential Transformer
architecture, tailored for 6G V2X communication with a specific focus on
enabling collaborative perception among connected autonomous vehicles. Our
model integrates key components of the 6G physical layer, designed to boost
performance in dynamic and challenging autonomous driving environments. We
validate the proposed system across a range of scenarios, including
3GPP-defined Urban Macro (UMa) channel. To assess the model's real-world
applicability, we evaluate its robustness within a V2X framework. In a
collaborative perception scenario, our system processes heterogeneous LiDAR and
camera data from four connected vehicles in dynamic cooperative vehicular
networks. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving an average precision of 0.84, highlighting the potential of
our proposed approach to enable robust, intelligent, and adaptive wireless
cooperation for next-generation connected autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: In agriculture, molecular communication (MC) is envisioned as a framework to
address critical challenges such as smart pest control. While conventional
approaches mostly rely on synthetic plant protection products, posing high
risks for the environment, harnessing plant signaling processes can lead to
innovative approaches for nature-inspired sustainable pest control. In this
paper, we investigate an approach for sustainable pest control and reveal how
the MC paradigm can be employed for analysis and optimization. In particular,
we consider a system where herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs),
specifically methyl salicylate (MeSA), is encapsulated into microspheres
deployed on deployed on plant leaves. The controlled release of MeSA from the
microspheres, acting as transmitters (TXs), supports pest deterrence and
antagonist attraction, providing an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic plant
protection products. Based on experimental data, we investigate the MeSA
release kinetics and obtain an analytical model. To describe the propagation of
MeSA in farming environments, we employ a three dimensional (3D)
advection-diffusion model, incorporating realistic wind fields which are
predominantly affecting particle propagation, and solve it by a finite
difference method (FDM). The proposed model is used to investigate the MeSA
distribution for different TX arrangements, representing different practical
microsphere deployment strategies. Moreover, we introduce the coverage
effectiveness index (CEI) as a novel metric to quantify the environmental
coverage of MeSA. This analysis offers valuable guidance for the practical
development of microspheres and their deployment aimed at enhancing coverage
and, consequently, the attraction of antagonistic insects.

Motivation: 研究网络资源可替换性及其对系统鲁棒性的影响，尤其是在部分组件失效时如何通过多样化组件实现快速恢复。

Method: 定义了多种新的度量指标来量化资源可替换性，适用于静态、移动和动态网络。

Result: 提出的度量方法能够有效评估网络中的资源可替换性及其对系统恢复能力的影响。

Conclusion: 通过度量资源可替换性，可以增强网络在面对组件失效时的鲁棒性和恢复能力。

Abstract: Degeneracy is the ability of structurally different elements to perform the
same function or yield the same output under certain constraints. In contrast
to redundancy, which implies identical backups, degeneracy allows diverse
components to step in and perform the same or similar role. Mathematically, it
is about mapping multiple distinct elements into the same function. In a
degenerate system, failure in one part can be compensated by others not
structurally linked. System functions are distributed within the system itself
or the entire network. This renders faster and more adaptive recovery. In this
work, we define and formulate several novel metrics for resource fungibility to
address robustness in networks (static/mobile/dynamic).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联合事件相机和RGB相机的传输方案，通过消除冗余信息优化带宽利用，并实现实时去模糊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合系统中事件相机和RGB相机输出存在大量冗余信息，传输大量数据成为挑战。

Method: 采用贝叶斯建模和信息瓶颈方法，分离共享和领域特定信息，自适应分配传输带宽。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方案在重建质量和去模糊性能上优于传统系统。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效优化了带宽利用并提升了性能。

Abstract: Event cameras asynchronously capture pixel-level intensity changes with
extremely low latency. They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB
cameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major
challenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume
of triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission
scheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while
accomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and
event cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often
resulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address
this, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to
eliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our
approach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to
disentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs.
This disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness
and informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information.
Moreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene
dynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to
images for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
scheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to
conventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance.

Motivation: 旋转天线通过利用额外的空间自由度提升通信性能，但需准确的信道状态信息（CSI）以调整天线方向。

Method: 方案包含两个交替步骤：首先估计给定RA方向的CSI，然后根据估计结果调整RA方向以最大化有效信道增益。

Result: 仿真显示该方案优于其他基准方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法能显著提升RA系统的信道估计性能。

Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising antenna architecture that exploits
additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance the communication
performance. To fully obtain the performance gain provided by RAs, accurate
channel state information (CSI) is essential for adjusting the
orientation/boresight of each antenna. In this letter, we propose an efficient
channel estimation scheme for RA communication systems, where the base station
(BS) can sequentially and adaptively adjust the orientations of RAs to enrich
the environmental observations from diverse angular perspectives, thereby
enhancing the channel estimation accuracy. The proposed scheme includes two
main procedures that are conducted alternately during each channel training
period. Specifically, the first procedure is to estimate the CSI with given
RAs' orientations, involving the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) information and path
gains. Then, based on the estimated CSI, the second procedure adjusts the RAs'
orientations to maximize the effective channel gain. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation method outperforms other
benchmark schemes.

Abstract: We consider an unsourced random access (URA) system enhanced with a feedback
mechanism that serves both communication and sensing tasks. While traditional
URA systems do not incorporate feedback, we propose a novel feedback signal
design that announces the decoding status of users and simultaneously enables
target sensing. To design this dual-purpose feedback, we introduce a modified
projected gradient descent algorithm that minimizes a weighted combination of
communication and sensing errors. Simulation results show that the proposed
feedback design outperforms the state-of-the-art feedback design in the URA
literature. Furthermore, we illustrate the trade-off between communication and
sensing capabilities, offering valuable insight into balancing these two tasks.

Conclusion: VoxelOpt通过结合学习和迭代方法的优势，提供了一种高效且准确的配准解决方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image
registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and
accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges
with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform
compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While
iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are
considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,
we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines
the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better
balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement
entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each
voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it
introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy
receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level
image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential
complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive
learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature
extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to
outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching
state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision. The
source code will be available at https://github.com/tinymilky/VoxelOpt

Motivation: 解决确定性LTI系统中纯驱动变量的发现问题，特别是在带有代数关系的动态系统中。

Method: 使用DIPCA确定代数关系数和动力学关系数，通过约束矩阵的分区找到最小驱动子集。

Result: PoV方法在LTI-DAE系统中有效识别因果驱动变量。

Conclusion: PoV方法在处理带代数关系的动态系统中更具优势。

Abstract: Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is
of vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A
recent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal
discovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are
identified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical
systems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method
works efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations.
However, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are
coupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or
mixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables
(PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is
superior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as
PoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic
equations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal
subset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations
($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix.
Subsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of
the constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
