### [1] [Efficient handover based on Near-field and Far-field RIS for seamless connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22141)
*Atiquzzaman Mondal,Waheeb Tashan,Ayat Al-Olaimat,Hüseyin Arslan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于可重构智能表面（RIS）的高效切换管理方案，优化6G网络的移动性管理，减少信令开销，提升覆盖和连接性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G通信网络中，RIS技术能够智能调控电磁波以增强覆盖和连接性。本文旨在通过RIS优化切换管理，减少不必要的切换和信令负载。

Method: 分析RIS辅助网络中信号强度的变化，推导近场区域的RIS-UE距离概率密度函数，提出结合多种切换类别的智能切换算法。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法显著降低了切换率和信令负载，提升了频谱和能量效率，改善了服务质量。

Conclusion: RIS辅助的切换管理方案在6G网络中具有潜力，可实现无缝连接和优化的移动性管理。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is becoming a transformative
technology for the upcoming 6G communication networks, providing a way for
smartly maneuvering the electromagnetic waves to enhance coverage and
connectivity. This paper presents an efficient handover (HO) management scheme
leveraging RIS in the Fresnel region i.e., in both the near-field (NF) and
far-field (FF) regions to reduce signaling overhead and optimize mobility
management. For this, we analyzed the signal strength variations in the
considered RIS-aided networks, considering the radiative NF and FF regions, and
derive the probability density function (PDF) of the RIS-UE distance in the NF
region to quantify RIS reflection gains along the user equipment (UE)
trajectory. We propose a new HO algorithm incorporating several HO categories
like hard handover (HHO), soft handover (SHO), RIS-aided cell breathing
(RIS-CB), and RIS-aided ping-pong avoidance (RIS-PP) strategies. The proposed
algorithm uses bit error rate (BER) as a key parameter to predict the
minimization of unnecessary HOs by using RIS-aided pathways to retain
connectivity with the serving base station (BS), which minimizes the
requirement for frequent target BS searching and ultimately optimizes the HO.
By restricting measurement reports and HO requests, the suggested method
improves spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), especially in
crowded cellular networks. Numerical results highlight significant reductions
in HO rates and signaling load, ensuring seamless connectivity and improved
quality of service (QoS) in 6G systems.

### [2] [Deep Learning for Gradient and BCG Artifacts Removal in EEG During Simultaneous fMRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22263)
*K. A. Shahriar,E. H. Bhuiyan,Q. Luo,M. E. H. Chowdhury,X. J. Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于深度学习的去噪自编码器（DAR），用于消除同步EEG-fMRI记录中的磁共振伪影，相较于传统方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步EEG-fMRI记录因磁共振伪影（如梯度伪影和心电伪影）干扰EEG信号，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过1D卷积自编码器，DAR学习从含噪声信号到干净信号的直接映射，使用了CWL EEG-fMRI数据集中的配对数据进行训练。

Result: DAR在RMSE、SSIM和SNR等指标上显著优于传统方法（PCA、ICA等），并通过LOSO验证了模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAR是一种高效且可解释的实时EEG伪影去除方法，适用于同步EEG-fMRI应用。

Abstract: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording combines high temporal and spatial resolution
for tracking neural activity. However, its usefulness is greatly limited by
artifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and
ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To
address this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning
framework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using
paired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from
the CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a
direct mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional
artifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent
component analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet
thresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared
error (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of
0.8885 $\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB.
Statistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are
significant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO)
cross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an
average RMSE of 0.0635 $\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\pm$ 0.0880 across
unseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that
DAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to
interpret. Overall, these results position DAR as a potential and
understandable solution for real-time EEG artifact removal in simultaneous
EEG-fMRI applications.

Method: 采用变分贝叶斯算法和单环参数估计策略，优化滤波、平滑和参数估计效率。

Result: 实验表明，模型在各种噪声设置下表现鲁棒，且计算资源消耗更低。

Conclusion: 该方法在鲁棒控制和金融建模等领域具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: State-space models are pivotal for dynamic system analysis but often struggle
with outlier data that deviates from Gaussian distributions, frequently
exhibiting skewness and heavy tails. This paper introduces a robust extension
utilizing the asymmetric Laplace distribution, specifically tailored to capture
these complex characteristics. We propose an efficient variational Bayes
algorithm and a novel single-loop parameter estimation strategy, significantly
enhancing the efficiency of the filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation
processes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our methods provide
consistently robust performance across various noise settings without the need
for manual hyperparameter adjustments. In stark contrast, existing models
generally rely on specific noise conditions and necessitate extensive manual
tuning. Moreover, our approach uses far fewer computational resources, thereby
validating the model's effectiveness and underscoring its potential for
practical applications in fields such as robust control and financial modeling.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率射频链导致的功耗问题，平衡能效与性能。

Method: 动态根据符号向量结构关闭不必要天线。

Result: 仿真表明算法优于SQUID和RZF，性能更优且功耗更低。

Conclusion: 该算法在能效和性能间取得良好平衡，适合未来6G通信。

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one
of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless
communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user
equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of
antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains
associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To
address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to
balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this
work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free
massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates
unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby
enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm
outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford
splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior
performance while effectively reducing power consumption.

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) map is a promising technique for capturing the
characteristics of multipath signal propagation, offering critical support for
channel modeling, coverage analysis, and beamforming in wireless communication
networks. This paper proposes a novel RF map construction method based on a
combination of physics-informed neural network (PINN) and graph neural network
(GNN). The PINN incorporates physical constraints derived from electromagnetic
propagation laws to guide the learning process, while the GNN models spatial
correlations among receiver locations. By parameterizing multipath signals into
received power, delay, and angle of arrival (AoA), and integrating both
physical priors and spatial dependencies, the proposed method achieves accurate
prediction of multipath parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the
method enables high-precision RF map construction under sparse sampling
conditions and delivers robust performance in both indoor and complex outdoor
environments, outperforming baseline methods in terms of generalization and
accuracy.

Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague.
The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus
determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information
for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map
(DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature
augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost
but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is
explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first
generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking
model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast
Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset.

### [7] [Fundamental Limits of Rigid Body Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22573)
*Niclas Führling,Ivan Alexander Morales Sandoval,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu,Gonzalo Seco-Granados,David González G.,Osvaldo Gonsa*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的Cramér-Rao下限（CRLB）形式化方法，用于评估刚性定位（RBL）问题中平移和旋转估计的基本精度限制。通过信息中心的Fisher信息矩阵（FIM）构造，该方法能够捕捉每种测量对FIM的贡献，并推导出适用于所有刚性定位场景的通用CRLB框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FIM形式化方法仅适用于点目标，而刚性定位问题需要同时估计平移和旋转，因此需要一种更通用的CRLB框架。

Method: 采用信息中心的FIM构造方法，捕捉测量类型及其误差分布对FIM的贡献，并推导出适用于刚性定位场景的CRLB框架。

Result: 给出了所有CRLB的闭式表达式，包括包含旋转矩阵正交约束的限界。数值结果表明，该方法能正确限界现有估计算法的误差。

Conclusion: 提出了一种通用CRLB框架，适用于刚性定位问题，揭示了现有算法的精度极限并表明仍有改进空间。

Abstract: We consider a novel approach to formulate the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB)
for the rigid body localization (RBL) problem, which allows us to assess the
fundamental accuracy limits on the estimation of the translation and rotation
of a rigid body with respect to a known reference. To that end, we adopt an
information-centric construction of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which
allows to capture the contribution of each measurement towards the FIM, both in
terms of input measurement types, as well as of their error distributions.
Taking advantage of this approach, we derive a generic framework for the CRLB
formulation, which is applicable to any type of rigid body localization
scenario, extending the conventional FIM formulation suitable for point targets
to the case of a rigid body whose location include both translation vector and
the rotation matrix (or alternative the rotation angles), with respect to a
reference. Closed-form expressions for all CRLBs are given, including the bound
incorporating an orthonormality constraint onto the rotation matrix. Numerical
results illustrate that the derived expression correctly lower-bounds the
errors of estimated localization parameters obtained via various related
state-of-the-art (SotA) estimators, revealing their accuracies and suggesting
that SotA RBL algorithms can still be improved.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于空间注意力的深度学习方法（MsSAN），用于解决超大规模MIMO（XL-MIMO）近场信道估计问题，通过学习子信道相关性提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超大规模阵列（ELAA）带来更高频谱效率和空间自由度，但近场信道估计问题突出。现有方法依赖变换域稀疏性，对变换矩阵选择和停止标准敏感。深度学习在远场信道估计中的成功启发了本文的研究。

Method: 分析了近场信道的空间天线相关性，提出基于子信道交互的描述方式。设计了多尺度空间注意力网络（MsSAN），利用点积和作为空间注意力机制，学习子信道相关性。

Result: 仿真结果表明，MsSAN在近场信道重建中表现出显著的子信道相关性学习能力，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的MsSAN方法有效解决了近场信道估计问题，为超大规模MIMO系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: The deployment of extremely large-scale array (ELAA) brings higher spectral
efficiency and spatial degree of freedom, but triggers issues on near-field
channel estimation.
  Existing near-field channel estimation schemes primarily exploit sparsity in
the transform domain.
  However, these schemes are sensitive to the transform matrix selection and
the stopping criteria.
  Inspired by the success of deep learning (DL) in far-field channel
estimation, this paper proposes a novel spatial-attention-based method for
reconstructing extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) channel.
  Initially, the spatial antenna correlations of near-field channels are
analyzed as an expectation over the angle-distance space, which demonstrate
correlation range of an antenna element varies with its position.
  Due to the strong correlation between adjacent antenna elements, interactions
of inter-subchannel are applied to describe inherent correlation of near-field
channels instead of inter-element.
  Subsequently, a multi-scale spatial attention network (MsSAN) with the
inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities is proposed tailed to
near-field MIMO channel estimation.
  We employ the multi-scale architecture to refine the subchannel size in
MsSAN.
  Specially, we inventively introduce the sum of dot products as spatial
attention (SA) instead of cross-covariance to weight subchannel features at
different scales in the SA module.
  Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed MsSAN achieves
remarkable the inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities and
outperforms others in terms of near-field channel reconstruction.

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宽带太赫兹通信系统面临严重的路径衰减问题，需要大规模阵列来缓解。同时，近场球形波前和宽带波束分裂现象增加了信道建模的复杂性，需要高效的信道估计方法。

Method: 提出了一种频率无关的正交字典，扩展了标准DFT矩阵以捕获近场特性，并通过二维块稀疏结构在压缩感知框架中进行信道估计。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的二维块稀疏感知方法在近场宽带信道估计上优于传统的极域方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了宽带太赫兹通信系统的近场信道估计问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the channel acquisition problem for a wideband terahertz (THz)
communication system, where an extremely large-scale array is deployed to
mitigate severe path attenuation. In channel modeling, we account for both the
near-field spherical wavefront and the wideband beam-splitting phenomena,
resulting in a wideband near-field channel. We propose a frequency-independent
orthogonal dictionary that generalizes the standard discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) matrix by introducing an additional parameter to capture the near-field
property. This dictionary enables the wideband near-field channel to be
efficiently represented with a two-dimensional (2D) block-sparse structure.
Leveraging this specific sparse structure, the wideband near-field channel
estimation problem can be effectively addressed within a customized compressive
sensing framework. Numerical results demonstrate the significant advantages of
our proposed 2D block-sparsity-aware method over conventional
polar-domain-based approaches for near-field wideband channel estimation.

TL;DR: 研究通过EEG解码揭示了抑郁症和自杀倾向患者在情感语义处理中的神经动力学差异，提供了潜在的生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症和自杀倾向对认知和情感有深远影响，但缺乏客观的神经生理学生物标志物。

Method: 使用多变量解码分析137名参与者在完成句子评估任务时的EEG数据。

Result: 抑郁症和自杀倾向患者表现出更早、更长且更强的神经反应，以及更广泛的前中央和顶颞叶激活。

Conclusion: 研究发现临床群体对情感内容的敏感性改变，为开发EEG为基础的抑郁症和自杀倾向生物标志物提供了依据。

Abstract: Depression and suicidality profoundly impact cognition and emotion, yet
objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain elusive. We investigated the
spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in
individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and
suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data.
Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally
charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified
robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy
between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation
and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with
depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater
amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization
and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These
findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from
emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding
of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis
for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.

### [12] [Ambiguity-Aware Segmented Estimation of Mutual Coupling in Large RIS: Algorithm and Experimental Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22750)
*Philipp del Hougne*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种处理RIS元素间互耦（MC）参数的分段估计方法，解决了大规模MC矩阵估计的挑战，并通过实验验证了模型准确性和优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RIS元素间互耦（MC）参数数量随元素数平方增长带来的可扩展性问题，提高模型估计的准确性。

Method: 将完整估计问题分解为三个顺序处理的小问题集，分别估计组内MC、组间MC及组间连接，支持并行化和高效初始化。

Result: 实验验证显示该方法校准的模型准确度达40.5 dB，显著优于无MC意识的基准模型（17.0 dB和13.8 dB），RIS优化性能预测更可靠。

Conclusion: MC意识对RIS优化的实际性能提升有限，但对模型预测可靠性至关重要；分段估计方法有效解决大规模MC矩阵估计难题。

Abstract: Optimizing a real-life RIS-parametrized wireless channel with a
physics-consistent multiport-network model necessitates prior remote estimation
of the mutual coupling (MC) between RIS elements. The number of MC parameters
grows quadratically with the number of RIS elements, posing scalability
challenges. Because of inevitable ambiguities, independently estimated segments
of the MC matrix cannot be easily stitched together. Here, by carefully
handling the ambiguities, we achieve a separation of the full estimation
problem into three sequentially treated sets of smaller problems. We partition
the RIS elements into groups. First, we estimate the MC for one group as well
as the characteristics of the available loads. Second, we separately estimate
the MC for each of the remaining groups, in each case with partial overlap with
an already characterized group. Third, we separately estimate the MC between
each distinct pair of groups. Full parallelization is feasible within the
second and third sets of problems, and the third set of problems can
furthermore benefit from efficient initialization. We experimentally validate
our algorithm for a 4x4 MIMO channel parametrized by a 100-element RIS inside a
rich-scattering environment. Our experimentally calibrated 5867-parameter
multiport-network model achieves an accuracy of 40.5 dB, whereas benchmark
models with limited or no MC awareness only reach 17.0 dB and 13.8 dB,
respectively. Based on the experimentally calibrated models, we optimize the
RIS for five wireless performance indicators. Experimental measurements with
the optimized RIS configurations demonstrate only moderate benefits of MC
awareness in RIS optimization in terms of the achieved performance. However, we
observe that limited or no MC awareness markedly erodes the reliability of
model-based predictions of the expected performance.

Result: 在接收端噪声可忽略时，算法对时不变和时变信道均渐近收敛到平均值。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和模拟验证，算法在无线网络中表现良好。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the average consensus problem of multi-agent
systems over wireless networks. We propose a distributed average consensus
algorithm by invoking the concept of over-the-air aggregation, which exploits
the signal superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels. The
proposed algorithm deploys a modified version of the well-known Ratio Consensus
algorithm with an additional normalization step for compensating for the
arbitrary channel coefficients. We show that, when the noise level at the
receivers is negligible, the algorithm converges asymptotically to the average
for time-invariant and time-varying channels. Numerical simulations corroborate
the validity of our results.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Morph, a LoRa encoder-decoder co-design to enhance
communication reliability while improving its computation efficiency in
extremely-low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situations. The standard LoRa encoder
controls 6 Spreading Factors (SFs) to tradeoff SNR tolerance with data rate.
SF-12 is the maximum SF providing the lowest SNR tolerance on commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa nodes. In Morph, we develop an SF-configuration based
encoder to mimic the larger SFs beyond SF-12 while it is compatible with COTS
LoRa nodes. Specifically, we manipulate four SF configurations of a Morph
symbol to encode 2-bit data. Accordingly, we recognize the used SF
configuration of the symbol for data decoding. We leverage a Deep Neural
Network (DNN) decoder to fully capture multi-dimensional features among diverse
SF configurations to maximize the SNR gain. Moreover, we customize the input
size, neural network structure, and training method of the DNN decoder to
improve its efficiency, reliability, and generalizability. We implement Morph
with COTS LoRa nodes and a USRP N210, then evaluate its performance on indoor
and campus-scale testbeds. Results show that we can reliably decode data at
-28.8~dB SNR, which is 6.4~dB lower than the standard LoRa with SF-12 chirps.
In addition, the computation efficiency of our DNN decoder is about 3x higher
than state-of-the-art.
