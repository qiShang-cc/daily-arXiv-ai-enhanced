### [1] [Binary Hypothesis Testing-Based Low-Complexity Beamspace Channel Estimation for mmWave Massive MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01007)
*Hanyoung Park,Ji-Woong Choi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于贝叶斯二进制假设检验和波束空间稀疏性的低复杂度信道去噪方法，适用于毫米波系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波通信面临信号路径损耗大、散射差等问题，需要高精度的信道估计，但传统方法计算复杂度高。

Method: 使用伯努利-复高斯先验，通过似然比检验检测信号相关元素，并用硬阈值规则抑制噪声主导成分。

Result: 方法计算复杂度极低，但信道估计精度接近复杂迭代或基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于资源受限的毫米波系统。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications have gained attention as a key
technology for high-capacity wireless systems, owing to the wide available
bandwidth. However, mmWave signals suffer from their inherent characteristics
such as severe path loss, poor scattering, and limited diffraction, which
necessitate the use of large antenna arrays and directional beamforming,
typically implemented through massive MIMO architectures. Accurate channel
estimation is critical in such systems, but its computational complexity
increases proportionally with the number of antennas. This may become a
significant burden in mmWave systems where channels exhibit rapid fluctuations
and require frequent updates. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity
channel denoiser based on Bayesian binary hypothesis testing and beamspace
sparsity. By modeling each sparse beamspace component as a mixture of signal
and noise under a Bernoulli-complex Gaussian prior, we formulate a likelihood
ratio test to detect signal-relevant elements. Then, a hard-thresholding rule
is applied to suppress noise-dominant components in the noisy channel vector.
Despite its extremely low computational complexity, the proposed method
achieves channel estimation accuracy that is comparable to that of complex
iterative or learning-based approaches. This effectiveness is supported by both
theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, suggesting that the method can
be a viable option for mmWave systems with strict resource constraints.

### [2] [Coordinated Decentralized Resource Optimization for Cell-Free ISAC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01044)
*Mehdi Zafari,Rang Liu,A. Lee Swindlehurst*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种用于无小区ISAC网络的协调分散优化算法，分别针对波束成形和功率分配，并通过仿真验证了其可行性与可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ISAC解决方案多为集中式架构，难以适应分布式系统的可扩展性需求，因此需要开发分散优化方法。

Method: 提出了两种算法：第一种结合本地波束成形与集中式功率分配；第二种通过分散共识ADMM框架联合优化波束成形与功率控制。

Result: 仿真验证了两种算法在减少前传开销和提升系统性能方面的实用性。

Conclusion: 两种分散优化算法适用于无小区ISAC网络，为分布式系统的可扩展部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for
6G wireless networks, allowing the joint use of spectrum and infrastructure for
both communication and sensing. While prior ISAC solutions have addressed
resource optimization, including power allocation, beamforming, and waveform
design, they often rely on centralized architectures with full network
knowledge, limiting their scalability in distributed systems. In this paper, we
propose two coordinated decentralized optimization algorithms for beamforming
and power allocation tailored to cell-free ISAC networks. The first algorithm
employs locally designed fixed beamformers at access points (APs), combined
with a centralized power allocation scheme computed at a central server (CS).
The second algorithm jointly optimizes beamforming and power control through a
fully decentralized consensus ADMM framework. Both approaches rely on local
information at APs and limited coordination with the CS. Simulation results
obtained using our proposed Python-based simulation framework evaluate their
fronthaul overhead and system-level performance, demonstrating their
practicality for scalable ISAC deployment in decentralized, cell-free
architectures.

### [4] [On the Characterization and Evaluation of Doppler Squint in Wideband ODDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01283)
*Xuehan Wang,Jinhong Yuan,Jintao Wang,Zhi Sun*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了正交时延-多普勒分割复用（ODDM）调制中宽带效应（称为多普勒斜视效应，DSE）对系统性能的影响，并提出了应对方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究忽视了ODDM信号的宽带特性导致的交互色散，这可能导致性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析多径信道的时变频率响应，明确解释了DSE引起的额外时延-多普勒（DD）色散，并推导了基于RCP和ZP的宽带ODDM系统的特性。

Result: 数值结果证实了DSE的重要性，并展示了额外的DD扩展和更复杂的峰值区域外功率泄漏。

Conclusion: 本文的推导有助于开发精确的信号处理技术，适用于基于ODDM的集成感知与通信系统。

Abstract: The recently proposed orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM)
modulation has been demonstrated to enjoy excellent reliability over
doubly-dispersive channels. However, most of the prior analysis tends to ignore
the interactive dispersion caused by the wideband property of ODDM signal,
which possibly leads to performance degradation. To solve this problem, we
investigate the input-output relation of ODDM systems considering the wideband
effect, which is also known as the Doppler squint effect (DSE) in the
literature. The extra delay-Doppler (DD) dispersion caused by the DSE is first
explicitly explained by employing the time-variant frequency response of
multipath channels. Its characterization is then derived for both reduced
cyclic prefix (RCP) and zero padded (ZP)-based wideband ODDM systems, where the
extra DD spread and more complicated power leakage outside the peak region are
presented theoretically. Numerical results are finally provided to confirm the
significance of DSE. The derivations in this paper are beneficial for
developing accurate signal processing techniques in ODDM-based integrated
sensing and communication systems.

Abstract: A fully customisable chip-on board (COB) LED design to evoke two brain
responses simultaneously (steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and
transient evoked potential, P300) is discussed in this paper. Considering
different possible modalities in braincomputer interfacing (BCI), SSVEP is
widely accepted as it requires a lesser number of electroencephalogram (EEG)
electrodes and minimal training time. The aim of this work was to produce a
hybrid BCI hardware platform to evoke SSVEP and P300 precisely with reduced
fatigue and improved classification performance. The system comprises of four
independent radial green visual stimuli controlled individually by a 32-bit
microcontroller platform to evoke SSVEP and four red LEDs flashing at random
intervals to generate P300 events. The system can also record the P300 event
timestamps that can be used in classification, to improve the accuracy and
reliability. The hybrid stimulus was tested for realtime classification
accuracy by controlling a LEGO robot to move in four directions.

### [6] [Balancing Latency and Model Accuracy for Fluid Antenna-Assisted LM-Embedded MIMO Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01689)
*Yichen Jin,Zongze Li,Zeyi Ren,Qingfeng Lin,Yik-Chung Wu*

Method: 采用LM量化降低延迟，并利用FA技术提升传输能力；提出了一种基于块坐标下降框架的高效优化算法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，提出的FA辅助LM嵌入网络在延迟和PSNR方面优于其他基准网络。

Conclusion: FA技术显著降低了网络延迟并保持了模型精度，为LM嵌入网络提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of large model (LM)-embedded wireless
network for handling the trade-off problem of model accuracy and network
latency. To guarantee a high-quality of users' service, the network latency
should be minimized while maintaining an acceptable inference accuracy. To meet
this requirement, LM quantization is proposed to reduce the latency. However,
the excessive quantization may destroy the accuracy of LM inference. To this
end, a promising fluid antenna (FA) technology is investigated for enhancing
the transmission capacity, leading to a lower network latency in the
LM-embedded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network. To design the
FA-assisted LM-embedded network with the lower latency and higher accuracy
requirements, the latency and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) are considered
in the objective function. Then, an efficient optimization algorithm is
proposed under the block coordinate descent framework. Simulation results are
provided to show the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm, and the
performance gains from the proposed FA-assisted LMembedded network over the
other benchmark networks in terms of network latency and PSNR.

### [7] [Spectrum Sensing with Deep Clustering: Label-Free Radio Access Technology Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01709)
*Ljupcho Milosheski,Mihael Mohorčič,Carolina Fortuna*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型无线频谱感知工作流，无需标签数据即可训练模型，并通过自监督学习实现高效分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着连接设备增加和网络密集化，对无线频谱资源需求上升，但现有监督学习方法依赖大量标签数据，泛化能力存疑。

Method: 采用自监督深度学习架构，从原始FFT数据中自主提取频谱特征，无需预知RAT标签。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上表现优异，性能提升35个百分点，参数量和计算量分别减少22%和50%。

Conclusion: 该工作流为6G频谱感知提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The growth of the number of connected devices and network densification is
driving an increasing demand for radio network resources, particularly Radio
Frequency (RF) spectrum. Given the dynamic and complex nature of contemporary
wireless environments, characterized by a wide variety of devices and multiple
RATs, spectrum sensing is envisioned to become a building component of future
6G, including as a component within O-RAN or digital twins. However, the
current SotA research for RAT classification predominantly revolves around
supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach that require
extensive labeled dataset. Due to this, it is unclear how existing models
behave in environments for which training data is unavailable thus leaving open
questions regarding their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we
propose a new spectrum sensing workflow in which the model training does not
require any prior knowledge of the RATs transmitting in that area (i.e. no
labelled data) and the class assignment can be easily done through manual
mapping. Furthermore, we adapt a SSL deep clustering architecture capable of
autonomously extracting spectrum features from raw 1D Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) data. We evaluate the proposed architecture on three real-world datasets
from three European cities, in the 868 MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5.9 GHz bands
containing over 10 RATs and show that the developed model achieves superior
performance by up to 35 percentage points with 22% fewer trainable parameters
and 50% less floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) compared to an SotA
AE-based reference architecture.

### [8] [ModFus-DM: Explore the Representation in Modulated Signal Diffusion Generated Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01719)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督的自动调制分类框架ModFus-DM，利用扩散模型的生成能力解决标签少和信号长度不固定等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法需要大量标记信号且难以应对非固定信号长度、分布偏移和标签不足的挑战。

Method: 设计了调制信号扩散生成模型（MSDGM）和扩散感知特征融合（DAFFus）模块，通过渐进去噪和多尺度特征融合增强表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其是在标签有限的场景下，SNR≥12dB时准确率超过88.27%。

Conclusion: ModFus-DM为自动调制分类提供了一种有效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于多种复杂场景。

Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is essential for wireless
communication systems in both military and civilian applications. However,
existing deep learning-based AMC methods often require large labeled signals
and struggle with non-fixed signal lengths, distribution shifts, and limited
labeled signals. To address these challenges, we propose a modulation-driven
feature fusion via diffusion model (ModFus-DM), a novel unsupervised AMC
framework that leverages the generative capacity of diffusion models for robust
modulation representation learning. We design a modulated signal diffusion
generation model (MSDGM) to implicitly capture structural and semantic
information through a progressive denoising process. Additionally, we propose
the diffusion-aware feature fusion (DAFFus) module, which adaptively aggregates
multi-scale diffusion features to enhance discriminative representation.
Extensive experiments on RML2016.10A, RML2016.10B, RML2018.01A and RML2022
datasets demonstrate that ModFus-DM significantly outperforms existing methods
in various challenging scenarios, such as limited-label settings, distribution
shifts, variable-length signal recognition and channel fading scenarios.
Notably, ModFus-DM achieves over 88.27% accuracy in 24-type recognition tasks
at SNR $\geq $ 12dB with only 10 labeled signals per type.

Abstract: This letter presents an innovative scheme to enhance the communication rate
and energy efficiency (EE) of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in wireless powered
communication networks (WPCNs) by deploying the emerging fluid antenna system
(FAS) technology onto the UAV. Our proposed approach leverages the dynamic port
switching capability of FAS, enabling the UAV to adaptively select the optimal
antenna location that maximizes channel gain for both downlink wireless power
transfer (WPT) and uplink wireless data transfer (WDT). We derive both exact
analytical expression of the ergodic spectral rate, and asymptotic expression
at high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime under Nakagami-m correlated fading
channels. The Mont-Carlo simulation results confirms the accuracy of the
analytical expressions and demonstrate the substantial increase in energy
efficiency of UAV with FAS compared to fixed antenna systems.

Conclusion: 研究发现对超对角RIS、堆叠智能超表面等有延伸应用价值。

Abstract: This Letter fills the research gap on physics-consistent optimization for
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with mutual coupling (MC) and
1-bit-tunable elements, a common hardware constraint in existing RIS
prototypes. We compare a model-based method (temperature-annealed
back-propagation) and model-agnostic methods (coordinate descent, genetic
algorithm), and evaluate potential benefits of intelligently initializing these
methods. To facilitate our evaluation, we introduce a technique for generating
statistical ensembles of multiport-network model parameters, wherein a single
hyper-parameter adjusts the MC strength. The technique is a generalization of
Rayleigh fading to radio environments with deterministic programmability, and
it accounts for passivity constraints as well as the coherent-backscattering
effect. We find that, except when MC is negligible, coordinate descent with
random initialization yields the most favorable trade-off in terms of
performance, execution time and memory usage. We expect our findings to extend
to beyond-diagonal RIS, stacked intelligent metasurfaces, dynamic metasurface
antennas, and wave-domain physical neural networks.

Result: 分析表明，考虑互耦效应时，性能在5 dB SNR下提升了约5 dB。

Conclusion: 该研究为RIS辅助MIMO系统的高效信道估计提供了有效方法，尤其是在复杂实际环境中。

Abstract: The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with extremely
large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays at the base station has
emerged as a key enabler for enhancing wireless network performance. However,
this setup introduces high-dimensional channel matrices, leading to increased
computational complexity and pilot overhead in channel estimation. Mutual
coupling (MC) effects among densely packed unit cells, spatial correlation, and
near-field propagation conditions further complicate the estimation process.
Conventional estimators, such as linear minimum mean square error (MMSE),
require channel statistics that are challenging to acquire for high-dimensional
arrays, while least squares (LS) estimators suffer from performance
limitations. To address these challenges, the reduced-subspace least squares
(RS-LS) estimator leverages array geometry to enhance estimation accuracy. This
work advances the promising RS-LS estimation algorithm by explicitly
incorporating MC effects into the more realistic and challenging near-field
propagation environment within the increasingly relevant generalized RIS-aided
MIMO framework. Additionally, we investigate the impact of MC on the spatial
degrees of freedom (DoF). Our analysis reveals that accounting for MC effects
provides a significant performance gain of approximately 5 dB at an SNR of 5
dB, compared to conventional methods that ignore MC.

Result: 实验结果表明，该算法显著提升了联邦学习的稳定性和图像传输质量，并推导了数学收敛率。

Conclusion: FedSFR是一种高效的解决方案，解决了现有方法的不足，提升了图像传输系统的性能。

Abstract: Research in semantic communication has garnered considerable attention,
particularly in the area of image transmission, where joint source-channel
coding (JSCC)-based neural network (NN) modules are frequently employed.
However, these systems often experience performance degradation over time due
to an outdated knowledge base, highlighting the need for periodic updates. To
address this challenge in the context of training JSCC modules for image
transmission, we propose a federated learning (FL) algorithm with semantic
feature reconstruction (FR), named FedSFR. This algorithm more efficiently
utilizes the available communication capacity by allowing some of the selected
FL participants to transmit smaller feature vectors instead of local update
information. Unlike conventional FL methods, our approach integrates FR at the
parameter server (PS), stabilizing training and enhancing image transmission
quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
significantly enhances both the stability and effectiveness of the FL process
compared to other algorithms. Furthermore, we mathematically derive the
convergence rate to validate the improved performance.

Conclusion: 基于分数的生成模型在ISAC性能分析、算法设计和系统优化中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a key enabler for
next-generation wireless systems, aiming to support both high-throughput
communication and high-accuracy environmental sensing using shared spectrum and
hardware. Theoretical performance metrics, such as mutual information (MI),
minimum mean squared error (MMSE), and Bayesian Cram\'{e}r--Rao bound (BCRB),
play a key role in evaluating ISAC system performance limits. However, in
practice, hardware impairments, multipath propagation, interference, and scene
constraints often result in nonlinear, multimodal, and non-Gaussian
distributions, making it challenging to derive these metrics analytically.
Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying score-based generative
models to characterize these metrics from data, although not discussed for
ISAC. This paper provides a tutorial-style summary of recent advances in
score-based performance evaluation, with a focus on ISAC systems. We refer to
the summarized framework as scoring ISAC, which not only reflects the core
methodology based on score functions but also emphasizes the goal of scoring
(i.e., evaluating) ISAC systems under realistic conditions. We present the
connections between classical performance metrics and the score functions and
provide the practical training techniques for learning score functions to
estimate performance metrics. Proof-of-concept experiments on target detection
and localization validate the accuracy of score-based performance estimators
against ground-truth analytical expressions, illustrating their ability to
replicate and extend traditional analyses in more complex, realistic settings.
This framework demonstrates the great potential of score-based generative
models in ISAC performance analysis, algorithm design, and system optimization.

Abstract: Contactless cardiac monitoring has vast potential to replace contact-based
monitoring in various future scenarios such as smart home and in-cabin
monitoring. Various contactless sensors can be potentially implemented for
cardiac monitoring, such as cameras, acoustic sensors, Wi-Fi routers and
radars. Among all these sensors, radar could achieve unobtrusive monitoring
with high accuracy and robustness at the same time. The research about
radar-based cardiac monitoring can be generally divided into the radar
architecture design and signal-processing parts, where the former has been
thoroughly reviewed in the literature but not the latter. To the best of the
author knowledge, this is the first review paper that focuses on elaborating
the algorithms for extracting cardiac features from the received radar signal.
In addition, a new taxonomy is proposed to reveal the core feature of each
algorithm, with the pros and cons evaluated in detail. Furthermore, the public
datasets containing the received radar signal and ground-truth cardiac feature
signal are listed with detailed configurations, and the corresponding
evaluations may help the researchers select the suitable dataset. At last,
several unsolved challenges and future directions are suggested and discussed
in detail to encourage future research on solving the main obstacles in this
field. In summary, this review can be served as a guide for researchers and
practitioners to quickly understand the research trend and recent development
of the cardiac feature extraction algorithms, and it is worth further
investigating the relative area based on the proposed challenges and future
directions.

in cellular networks by avoiding overheads of sweeping methods while making
efficient use of resources. Phase-only BF is key for maximizing power
efficiency across antennas. A successful method to produce broad beams is the
phase-only dual-polarization BF (DPBF). However, its efficiency has not been
proved in non-line-of-sight (NLoS). Therefore, this paper contributes by
evaluating DPBF in collocated and distributed MIMO configurations under both
line-of-sight (LoS) and NLoS channel conditions. We model the reflection
coefficients for different materials in NLoS conditions and propose the use of
orthogonal space-time block code to improve the coverage compared to the DPBF
in collocated MIMO (C-MIMO). We further propose a DPBF method for distributed
MIMO and show that it achieves better coverage than C-MIMO with DPBF.

Abstract: Maximum likelihood factor analysis has been used for direction of arrival
estimation in unknown nonuniform noise and some iterative approaches have been
developed. In particular, the Factor Analysis for Anisotropic Noise (FAAN)
method proposed by Stoica and Babu has excellent convergence properties. In
this letter, the Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm,
an extension of the expectation-maximization algorithm, is designed, which has
almost the same computational complexity at each iteration as the FAAN method.
However, numerical results show that the ECME algorithm yields faster stable
convergence and is computationally more efficient.

TL;DR: 提出自适应相位偏移ISAC（APS-ISAC）方案，通过重叠块导频和用户特定相位偏移，显著提升频谱效率和感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的导频分配方案在频谱效率和感知性能之间存在矛盾，需要一种新的方案来优化两者的权衡。

Method: 采用重叠块导频结构，结合用户最大额外延迟确定的相位偏移，实现用户资源共享并保持可分离的信道响应。

Result: APS-ISAC显著优于传统方法，频谱效率翻倍，复杂度降低，同时实现高分辨率和无模糊感知。

Conclusion: APS-ISAC为未来上行ISAC系统提供了一种高效、低复杂度的导频设计范例。

Abstract: In uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, pilot signal
design is crucial for enabling accurate channel estimation and reliable radar
sensing. In orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based
frameworks, conventional pilot allocation schemes face a trade-off between
spectral efficiency (SE) and sensing performance. Interleaved pilots improve
user equipment (UE) multiplexing through sparse allocation but reduce the
maximum unambiguous range. Conversely, orthogonal block-based pilots reduce
range ambiguity but degrade sensing resolution due to limited delay
granularity. To address this trade-off, the phase-shifted ISAC (PS-ISAC) scheme
was recently proposed for uplink multiple access in ISAC systems. However,
PS-ISAC suffers from spectral inefficiency due to the fixed cyclic prefix (CP)
constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose adaptive
phase-shifted-ISAC (APS-ISAC), an enhanced pilot scheme that employs an
overlapped block-pilot structure with UE-specific phase shifts determined by
maximum excess delay of each UE. This design enables UEs to share the same
time-frequency resources while preserving separable and contiguous channel
impulse responses (CIRs) at the base station (BS). Simulation results show that
APS-ISAC significantly outperforms conventional pilot allocation methods in
terms of SE, approximately doubling the number of multiplexed UEs. It also
achieves lower mean square error (MSE) under power constraints with reduced
complexity. Furthermore, it yields maximum range resolution and unambiguous
sensing performance. These results establish APS-ISAC as a scalable, spectrally
efficient, ambiguity-resilient, and low-complexity pilot design paradigm for
future uplink ISAC systems.

Motivation: 监测呼吸参数（如呼吸率）有助于了解训练对马匹健康的影响，并提升其福利。

Method: 使用深度学习和信号处理方法，从麦克风录音中自动检测呼吸事件并提取动态呼吸率。

Result: 时间卷积网络在检测呼吸事件和估计动态呼吸率方面表现最优（F1分数0.94，MAE 1.44±1.04 bpm）。

Conclusion: 该研究首次实现了马匹运动中呼吸声音的自动检测和动态呼吸率的计算，未来将进一步优化模型和麦克风布设。

Abstract: Monitoring respiration parameters such as respiratory rate could be
beneficial to understand the impact of training on equine health and
performance and ultimately improve equine welfare. In this work, we compare
deep learning-based methods to an adapted signal processing method to
automatically detect cyclic respiratory events and extract the dynamic
respiratory rate from microphone recordings during high intensity exercise in
Standardbred trotters. Our deep learning models are able to detect exhalation
sounds (median F1 score of 0.94) in noisy microphone signals and show promising
results on unlabelled signals at lower exercising intensity, where the
exhalation sounds are less recognisable. Temporal convolutional networks were
better at detecting exhalation events and estimating dynamic respiratory rates
(median F1: 0.94, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) $\pm$ Confidence Intervals (CI):
1.44$\pm$1.04 bpm, Limits Of Agreements (LOA): 0.63$\pm$7.06 bpm) than long
short-term memory networks (median F1: 0.90, MAE$\pm$CI: 3.11$\pm$1.58 bpm) and
signal processing methods (MAE$\pm$CI: 2.36$\pm$1.11 bpm). This work is the
first to automatically detect equine respiratory sounds and automatically
compute dynamic respiratory rates in exercising horses. In the future, our
models will be validated on lower exercising intensity sounds and different
microphone placements will be evaluated in order to find the best combination
for regular monitoring.

TL;DR: 研究通过调整PWM占空比解决SSVEP中的视觉疲劳问题，发现85%占空比效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SSVEP因闪光刺激引起的视觉疲劳和PWM精度问题，以促进其实际应用。

Method: 使用定制LED硬件生成50%至95%的PWM占空比，记录EEG数据并测试十名受试者的视觉疲劳和SSVEP响应。

Result: 高占空比减少视觉疲劳，85%占空比在所有频率下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 85%占空比可能是SSVEP实际应用中解决视觉疲劳和性能问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based
diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high
information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through
simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual
stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use
preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in
establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer
accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these
issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual
stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor
response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high
duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints.
Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95%
generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten
subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all
the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak
response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of
SSVEP for practical applications.

Abstract: The reliability of affective state estimation using EEG data is in question,
given the variability in reported performance and the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols. To investigate this, we reviewed 101 studies, focusing on
the widely used DEAP dataset for emotion recognition. Our analysis revealed
widespread methodological issues that include data leakage from improper
segmentation, biased feature selection, flawed hyperparameter optimization,
neglect of class imbalance, and insufficient methodological reporting. Notably,
we found that nearly 87% of the reviewed papers contained one or more of these
errors. Moreover, through experimental analysis, we observed that such
methodological flaws can inflate the classification accuracy by up to 46%.
These findings reveal fundamental gaps in standardized evaluation practices and
highlight critical deficiencies in the peer review process for machine learning
applications in neuroscience, emphasizing the urgent need for stricter
methodological standards and evaluation protocols.

Motivation: 在有限时间内通过联合优化功率分配提高无线网络的保密能量效率，同时利用全双工技术和能量收集能力增强安全性。

Method: 将问题建模为有限时域强化学习问题，提出FHJPA算法，并与贪婪算法（GA）和无限时域算法（IHJPA）进行对比。

Result: FHJPA算法在SEE和计算时间上表现最优，GA在电池能量充足时接近FHJPA性能，IHJPA在时间延长时性能提升。

Conclusion: FHJPA算法是有限时域传输中的最佳选择，GA适用于低复杂度场景，IHJPA在长时域中表现更优。

Abstract: In this paper, a joint optimal allocation of transmit power at the source and
jamming power at the destination is proposed to maximize the average secrecy
energy efficiency (SEE) of a wireless network within a finite time duration.
The destination transmits the jamming signal to improve secrecy by utilizing
full-duplex capability. The source and destination both have energy harvesting
(EH) capability with limited battery capacity. Due to the Markov nature of the
system, the problem is formulated as a finite-horizon reinforcement learning
(RL) problem. We propose the finite-horizon joint power allocation (FHJPA)
algorithm for the finite-horizon RL problem and compare it with a
low-complexity greedy algorithm (GA). An infinite-horizon joint power
allocation (IHJPA) algorithm is also proposed for the corresponding
infinite-horizon problem. A comparative analysis of these algorithms is carried
out in terms of SEE, expected total transmitted secure bits, and computational
complexity. The results show that the FHJPA algorithm outperforms the GA and
IHJPA algorithms due to its appropriate modelling in finite horizon
transmission. When the source node battery has sufficient energy, the GA can
yield performance close to the FHJPA algorithm despite its low-complexity. When
the transmission time horizon increases, the accuracy of the infinite-horizon
model improves, resulting in a reduced performance gap between FHJPA and IHJPA
algorithms. The computational time comparison shows that the FHJPA algorithm
takes $16.6$ percent less time than the IHJPA algorithm.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于最优传输理论的多音高估计方法，通过正则化技术分离谱信号内容和字典设计，提升了估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多音高估计问题中，现有压缩感知方法存在相干性问题和谐波失谐现象的不鲁棒性，需要一种新的框架来改进。

Method: 使用最优传输理论的正则化技术，将信号谱内容推断并分配到少量谐波系列中，提出两种估计方法和高效算法。

Result: 数值实验显示，该方法在合成和真实数据上的估计性能优于传统统计信号处理方法，与网络方法表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过解耦正则化和字典设计，提升了多音高估计的鲁棒性和准确性，尤其在不依赖大量数据的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of multi-pitch estimation, i.e.,
identifying super-imposed truncated harmonic series from noisy measurements. We
phrase this as recovering a harmonically-structured measure on the unit circle,
where the structure is enforced using regularizers based on optimal transport
theory. In the resulting framework, a signal's spectral content is
simultaneously inferred and assigned, or transported, to a small set of
harmonic series defined by their corresponding fundamental frequencies. In
contrast to existing methods from the compressed sensing paradigm, the proposed
framework decouples regularization and dictionary design and mitigates
coherency problems. As a direct consequence, this also introduces robustness to
the phenomenon of inharmonicity. From this framework, we derive two estimation
methods, one for stochastic and one for deterministic signals, and propose
efficient numerical algorithms implementing them. In numerical studies on both
synthetic and real data, the proposed methods are shown to achieve better
estimation performance as compared to other methods from statistical signal
processing literature. Furthermore, they perform comparably or better than
network-based methods, except when the latter are specially trained on the
data-type considered and are given access to considerably more data during
inference.

Motivation: 探索基于OFDM的DPE方法的理论性能极限，尤其是其在NLOS多路径环境中的表现，以填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 推导了基于OFDM信号的DPE的CRB，并与传统两步定位法进行了性能对比，通过数值实验验证了不同条件下的定位效果。

Result: 1）DPE在所有条件下均优于两步法；2）大带宽和高子载波间距能显著提升性能；3）多OFDM符号使用可提高精度，但边际收益递减。

Conclusion: DPE在OFDM系统中表现出更强的鲁棒性和精度，但需权衡符号数量与计算复杂度。

Abstract: Although direct position estimation (DPE) has been demonstrated to offer
enhanced robustness in GNSS receivers, its theoretical limits and performance
in OFDM based positioning systems remain largely unexplored. In this paper, the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for DPE using OFDM based cellular signals is derived
and benchmarked against the conventional two-step positioning method to assess
their relative performance in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) dominated multipath
environments. Numerical results reveal that 1) the DPE method consistently
outperforms the two-step approach in OFDM systems under all evaluated
conditions; 2) a large bandwidth is crucial in both methods, and increasing
subcarrier spacing is more beneficial for a fixed bandwidth; 3) utilizing
multiple OFDM symbols for positioning leads to substantial improvements in
localization accuracy compared to relying on a single symbol. However, further
increasing the number of symbols yields marginal improvements while
significantly increasing computational complexity.

Conclusion: ToMA阵列在提升通信安全性和性能方面优于传统FPA阵列，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel towed movable antenna (ToMA) array architecture
to enhance the physical layer security of airborne communication systems.
Unlike conventional onboard arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the
ToMA array employs multiple subarrays mounted on flexible cables and towed by
distributed drones, enabling agile deployment in three-dimensional (3D) space
surrounding the central aircraft. This design significantly enlarges the
effective array aperture and allows dynamic geometry reconfiguration, offering
superior spatial resolution and beamforming flexibility. We consider a secure
transmission scenario where an airborne transmitter communicates with multiple
legitimate users in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. To ensure
security, zero-forcing beamforming is employed to nullify signal leakage toward
eavesdroppers. Based on the statistical distributions of locations of users and
eavesdroppers, the antenna position vector (APV) of the ToMA array is optimized
to maximize the users' ergodic achievable rate. Analytical results for the case
of a single user and a single eavesdropper reveal the optimal APV structure
that minimizes their channel correlation. For the general multiuser scenario,
we develop a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm by leveraging
Riemannian manifold optimization. Simulation results confirm that the proposed
ToMA array achieves significant performance gains over conventional onboard FPA
arrays, especially in scenarios where eavesdroppers are closely located to
users under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant channels.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) OAC systems designed to emulate the
fully-connected (FC) layer of a neural network (NN) via analog OAC, where the
RIS and the transceivers are jointly adjusted to engineer the ambient wireless
propagation environment to emulate the weights of the target FC layer. We refer
to this novel computational paradigm as AirFC. We first study the case in which
the precoder, combiner, and RIS phase shift matrices are jointly optimized to
minimize the mismatch between the OAC system and the target FC layer. To solve
this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity alternating
optimization algorithm, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all
optimization variables are derived. Next, we consider training of the system
parameters using two distinct learning strategies, namely centralized training
and distributed training. In the centralized training approach, training is
performed at either the transmitter or the receiver, whichever possesses the
channel state information (CSI), and the trained parameters are provided to the
other terminal. In the distributed training approach, the transmitter and
receiver iteratively update their parameters through back and forth
transmissions by leveraging channel reciprocity, thereby avoiding CSI
acquisition and significantly reducing computational complexity. Subsequently,
we extend our analysis to a multi-RIS scenario by exploiting its spatial
diversity gain to enhance the system performance. Simulation results show that
the AirFC system realized by the RIS-aided MIMO configuration achieves
satisfactory classification accuracy.

Result: 通过真实世界信道测量，评估了信号混淆和CSI恢复方法对CSI指纹、信道图绘制和三角定位等定位技术的影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，需要进一步努力保护用户隐私，防止敌对无线电定位系统的侵害。

Abstract: The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects
in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent
unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal
by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters
the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this
strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying
single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel
identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna
receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization
regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of
signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization
performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical
triangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to
demonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy
of users from adversarial radio-based localization systems.

Motivation: 集群化 Gossip 网络中，节点需要保持与源节点信息同步。传统方法在信息新鲜度方面存在不足，因此引入 RC-Gossip 机制，以更高效地提升信息传播效果。

Method: 提出 RC-Gossip 机制，动态调整信息传播速率，优先向最需要信息的节点传播。使用基于 renewal-reward 的分析方法，替代传统的 SHS 方法，评估信息新鲜度。

Result: RC-Gossip 在多种集群网络中显著提升了节点的信息新鲜度，且在不同集群规模下均表现最优。

Conclusion: RC-Gossip 机制通过动态调整传播速率，有效提升了集群化 Gossip 网络的信息新鲜度，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: A clustered gossip network is considered in which a source updates its
information over time, and end-nodes, organized in clusters through
clusterheads, are keeping track of it. The goal for the nodes is to remain as
fresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we
assess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart
mechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip
(RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that
need it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number
of fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System
(SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we
present an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based
approach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness
of nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared
to traditional gossiping techniques.

Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，不仅需要点估计，还需评估估计的不确定性；CRLB是评估无偏估计方差的重要工具，但其存在依赖参数独立支持的条件，限制了应用。

Method: 通过利用广义Leibniz积分规则，将CRLB推广到参数依赖支持的情况，提出CRLLB，并在多维参数框架下统一现有结果。

Result: CRLLB为参数依赖支持的似然函数提供了有效的协方差下界，并通过示例验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: CRLLB扩展了CRLB的适用范围，为参数估计中的不确定性评估提供了更通用的工具。

Abstract: Parameter estimation is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. In
many safety-critical applications, one is not only interested in a {\it point}
estimator, but also the uncertainty bound that can self-assess the accuracy of
the estimator. In this regard, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is of
great importance, as it provides a lower bound on the variance of {\it any}
unbiased estimator. In many cases, it is the only way of evaluating, without
recourse to simulations, the expected accuracy of numerically obtainable
estimates. For the existence of the CRLB, there have been widely accepted
regularity conditions, one of which is that the support of the likelihood
function (LF) -- the pdf of the observations conditioned on the parameter of
interest -- should be independent of the parameter to be estimated. This paper
starts from reviewing the derivations of the classical CRLB under the condition
that the LF has parameter-independent support. To cope with the case of
parameter-dependent support, we generalize the CRLB to the {\it
Cram\'{e}r-Rao-Leibniz lower bound (CRLLB)}, by leveraging the general Leibniz
integral rule. Notably, the existing results on CRLLB and CRLB are unified
under the framework of CRLLB with multidimensional parameters. Then, we survey
existing examples of LFs to illustrate the usefulness of the CRLLB in providing
valid covariance bounds.

Motivation: 大规模模型（LSM）在语义通信系统中有潜力，但实际部署面临计算复杂性和资源需求高的挑战。

Method: 通过知识蒸馏和轻量级架构搜索（KDL-DARTS）设计高效语义编码器，并开发两阶段鲁棒知识蒸馏（RKD）和通道感知变换器（CAT）模块增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，RKD-SC显著减少模型参数，同时保留教师模型的性能，并表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RKD-SC框架为资源受限环境下的高效语义通信提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

Conclusion: Pigeon-SL为未来智能无线网络提供了一种高效、鲁棒且隐私保护的分布式学习方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising
framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning
at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to
even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

### [32] [Perception of dynamic multi-speaker auditory scenes under different modes of attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02620)

TL;DR: 研究表明听觉注意力有多种模式，其中对象注意力比特征或全局注意力更有效，且不同注意力模式具有独特的神经机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索听觉领域中不同注意力模式（自下而上和自上而下）的相互作用及其神经基础。

Method: 采用'鸡尾酒会'范式，被试在相同刺激下分别关注空间位置、说话者或整个场景，同时检测声音偏差。

Result: 对象注意力更有效，不同模式神经机制不同，且自下而上显著性在注意力分配后作用减弱。

Conclusion: 听觉感知受任务驱动，由自上而下和自下而上过程的共同作用。

Abstract: Attention is not monolithic; rather, it operates in multiple forms to
facilitate efficient cognitive processing. In the auditory domain, attention
enables the prioritization of relevant sounds in an auditory scene and can be
either attracted by elements in the scene in a bottom-up fashion or directed
towards features, objects, or the entire scene in a top-down fashion. How these
modes of attention interact and whether their neural underpinnings are distinct
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the perceptual and neural
correlates of different attentional modes in a controlled "cocktail party"
paradigm, where listeners listen to the same stimuli and attend to either a
spatial location (feature-based), a speaker (object-based), or the entire scene
(global or free-listening) while detecting deviations in pitch of a voice in
the scene. Our findings indicate that object-based attention is more
perceptually effective than feature-based or global attention. Furthermore,
object-based and spatial-based attention engage distinct neural mechanisms and
are differentially modulated by bottom-up salience. Notably, while bottom-up
salience aids in the initial segregation of auditory objects, it plays a
reduced role in object tracking once attention has been voluntarily allocated.
In addition, decoding the stimulus envelope from the EEG data revealed a
source-sampling scheme in the global attention mode that is not present in the
object or spatial modes. Overall, the study shows that the perception of the
same acoustic scene differs according to the listening task, guided by an
interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于雷达的非接触式睡眠监测系统RestAware，解决了传统方法的舒适性和隐私问题，达到高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统睡眠监测方法（如可穿戴设备或摄像头）存在舒适性、遮挡和隐私问题。

Method: 采用24GHz FMCW雷达和KNN分类器，结合LLM生成个性化睡眠报告。

Result: 在25名参与者中实现92%的分类准确率和0.91的F1分数。

Conclusion: RestAware是一种低成本、保护隐私的实时睡眠监测方案。

Abstract: Monitoring sleep posture and behavior is critical for diagnosing sleep
disorders and improving overall sleep quality. However, traditional approaches,
such as wearable devices, cameras, and pressure sensors, often compromise user
comfort, fail under obstructions like blankets, and raise privacy concerns. To
overcome these limitations, we present RestAware, a non-invasive, contactless
sleep monitoring system based on a 24GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave
(FMCW) radar. Our system is evaluated on 25 participants across eight common
sleep postures, achieving 92% classification accuracy and an F1-score of 0.91
using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. In addition, we integrate
instruction-tuned large language models (Mistral, Llama, and Falcon) to
generate personalized, human-readable sleep summaries from radar-derived
posture data. This low-cost ($ 35), privacy-preserving solution offers a
practical alternative for real-time deployment in smart homes and clinical
environments.
