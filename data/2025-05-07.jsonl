This paper investigates a practical pinching-antennas system in\nmulti-waveguide scenarios, where pinching antennas are installed at\npre-configured discrete positions to serve downlink users with non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA). To improve system throughput, a sophisticated\noptimization problem is formulated by jointly considering waveguide assignment,\nantenna activation, successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order\ndesign, and power allocation. By treating waveguide assignment and antenna\nactivation as two coalition-formation games, a novel game-theoretic algorithm\nis developed, in which the optimal decoding order is derived and incorporated.\nFor power allocation, monotonic optimization and successive convex\napproximation (SCA) are employed to construct global optimal and low-complexity\nsolutions, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the NOMA-based\npinching-antenna system exhibits superior performance compared to the\nconsidered benchmark systems, and the proposed solutions provide significant\nimprovement in terms of sum rate and outage probability."}

With the\nadvent of digital acquisition, SpecEst algorithms have been widely applied to\ntasks like frequency super-resolution. However, conventional digital\nacquisition imposes a trade-off: for a fixed bit budget, one can optimize\neither signal dynamic range or digital resolution (noise floor), but not both\nsimultaneously. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) overcomes this limitation\nusing modulo non-linearity in analog hardware, enabling a novel approach to\nSpecEst (USF-SpecEst). However, USF-SpecEst requires new theoretical and\nalgorithmic developments to handle folded samples effectively. In this paper,\nwe derive the Cram\\'er-Rao Bounds (CRBs) for SpecEst with noisy modulo-folded\nsamples and reveal a surprising result: the CRBs for USF-SpecEst are scaled\nversions of the Gaussian CRBs for conventional samples. Numerical experiments\nvalidate these bounds, providing a benchmark for USF-SpecEst and facilitating\nits practical deployment."}

In a distributed setting, where a server\norchestrates training using data available at a set of remote users, unlearning\nis essential to cope with late-detected malicious or corrupted users. Existing\ndistributed unlearning algorithms require the server to store all model updates\nobserved in training, leading to immense storage overhead for preserving the\nability to unlearn. In this work we study lossy compression schemes for\nfacilitating distributed server-side unlearning with limited memory footprint.\nWe propose memory-efficient distributed unlearning (MEDU), a hierarchical lossy\ncompression scheme tailored for server-side unlearning, that integrates user\nsparsification, differential thresholding, and random lattice coding, to\nsubstantially reduce memory footprint. We rigorously analyze MEDU, deriving an\nupper bound on the difference between the desired model that is trained from\nscratch and the model unlearned from lossy compressed stored updates. Our bound\noutperforms the state-of-the-art known bounds for non-compressed decentralized\nserver-side unlearning, even when lossy compression is incorporated. We further\nprovide a numerical study, which shows that suited lossy compression can enable\ndistributed unlearning with notably reduced memory footprint at the server\nwhile preserving the utility of the unlearned model."}

One of the\nkey challenges in AOI is optimising inspection tolerances. Traditionally, this\nprocess relies heavily on the expertise and intuition of engineers, making it\nsubjective and prone to inconsistency. To address this, we are developing an\nintelligent, data-driven approach to optimise inspection tolerances in a more\nobjective and consistent manner. Most existing research in this area focuses\nprimarily on minimising false calls, often at the risk of allowing actual\ndefects to go undetected. This oversight can compromise product quality,\nespecially in critical sectors such as medical, defence, and automotive\nindustries. Our approach introduces the use of percentile rank, amongst other\nlogical strategies, to ensure that genuine defects are not overlooked. With\ncontinued refinement, our method aims to reach a point where every flagged item\nis a true defect, thereby eliminating the need for manual inspection. Our proof\nof concept achieved an 18% reduction in false calls at the 80th percentile\nrank, while maintaining a 100% recall rate.
