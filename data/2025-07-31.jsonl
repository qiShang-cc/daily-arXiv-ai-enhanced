This paper presents an efficient handover (HO) management scheme\nleveraging RIS in the Fresnel region i.e., in both the near-field (NF) and\nfar-field (FF) regions to reduce signaling overhead and optimize mobility\nmanagement. For this, we analyzed the signal strength variations in the\nconsidered RIS-aided networks, considering the radiative NF and FF regions, and\nderive the probability density function (PDF) of the RIS-UE distance in the NF\nregion to quantify RIS reflection gains along the user equipment (UE)\ntrajectory. We propose a new HO algorithm incorporating several HO categories\nlike hard handover (HHO), soft handover (SHO), RIS-aided cell breathing\n(RIS-CB), and RIS-aided ping-pong avoidance (RIS-PP) strategies. The proposed\nalgorithm uses bit error rate (BER) as a key parameter to predict the\nminimization of unnecessary HOs by using RIS-aided pathways to retain\nconnectivity with the serving base station (BS), which minimizes the\nrequirement for frequent target BS searching and ultimately optimizes the HO.\nBy restricting measurement reports and HO requests, the suggested method\nimproves spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), especially in\ncrowded cellular networks.

However, its usefulness is greatly limited by\nartifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and\nballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To\naddress this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning\nframework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using\npaired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from\nthe CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a\ndirect mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional\nartifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent\ncomponent analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet\nthresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared\nerror (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of\n0.8885 $\\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB.\nStatistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are\nsignificant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO)\ncross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an\naverage RMSE of 0.0635 $\\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\\pm$ 0.0880 across\nunseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that\nDAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to\ninterpret.
