<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧式眼动追踪系统在XR应用中无法满足高精度、低延迟和低功耗的需求，事件相机提供了潜在的解决方案。

Method: 提出轻量级神经网络架构ConvJANET层，简化ConvLSTM，采用线性激活函数近似和定点量化优化硬件设计。

Result: 在3ET+数据集上实现了2.45像素误差的高精度，达到1250 Hz事件帧率和0.5 ms端到端延迟，功耗为18.9 μJ/帧。

Conclusion: JaneEye为下一代XR可穿戴设备提供了高性能、低功耗的眼动追踪解决方案。

Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in
Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems
often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency,
and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering
ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we
present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware
accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse,
high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural
network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the
traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving
computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our
proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+
dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To
further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of
activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization.
Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at
400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames
Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a
new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable
for integration into next-generation XR wearables.

### [2] [Satellite Assignment Policy Learning for Coexistence in LEO Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01408)
*Jeong Min Kong,Ian P. Roberts*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图结构学习的算法，用于推断低地球轨道卫星系统中的主要卫星分配策略，以提高预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于主要系统未公开其卫星分配策略，次级系统需要开发方法来推断这些策略以实现频谱共享。

Method: 提出一种端到端的图结构学习算法，利用有限的历史数据学习最高仰角的主要卫星分配策略。

Result: 模拟结果显示，该方法优于最佳基线，预测准确性提高了约15%。

Conclusion: 该算法为次级系统提供了一种有效推断主要卫星分配策略的方法，有助于频谱共享的实现。

Abstract: Unlike in terrestrial cellular networks, certain frequency bands for
low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems have thus far been allocated on a
non-exclusive basis. In this context, systems that launch their satellites
earlier (referred to as primary systems) are given spectrum access priority
over those that launch later, known as secondary systems. For a secondary
system to function, it is expected to either coordinate with primary systems or
ensure that it does not cause excessive interference to primary ground users.
Reliably meeting this interference constraint requires real-time knowledge of
the receive beams of primary users, which in turn depends on the primary
satellite-to-primary user associations. However, in practice, primary systems
have thus far not publicly disclosed their satellite assignment policies;
therefore, it becomes essential for secondary systems to develop methods to
infer such policies. Assuming there is limited historical data indicating which
primary satellites have served which primary users, we propose an end-to-end
graph structure learning-based algorithm for learning highest elevation primary
satellite assignment policies, that, upon deployment, can directly map the
primary satellite coordinates into assignment decisions for the primary users.
Simulation results show that our method can outperform the best baseline,
achieving approximately a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文介绍了延迟增强的堆叠智能表面（DA-SIS），展示了其在信号时域处理和模拟均衡器中的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索堆叠智能表面（SIS）在空间波域信号处理之外的功能，通过引入时延增强进一步扩展其应用场景。

Method: 提出延迟增强的SIS（DA-SIS），研究其可行性，并通过模拟均衡器消除多径引起的符号间干扰（ISI）。

Result: DA-SIS在均衡过程中展示了元素数量对误码率（BER）的影响，并显示其与数字均衡器相比的潜力。

Conclusion: DA-SIS为未来研究提供了方向，展示了其在信号处理领域的广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS)s have been proposed recently as an
enabling technology for Holographic Multiple Input Multiple Output (HMIMO) and
Ultra-massive MIMO (umMIMO) technologies. Their utility can extend beyond
spatial wave-domain processing of signals if they are enhanced with
strategically-tuned symbol-duration level delays to enable temporal processing
as well. In this work, we introduce the idea of a delay-augmented SIS (DA-SIS).
We shed light on the feasibility of realizing delay units in an SIS. Then, we
discuss the relevance of the proposed DA-SIS and present a use case that
illustrates its potential, wherein the DA-SIS serves as an analog equalizer
that aids in eliminating multi-path-induced inter-symbol-interference (ISI). We
show how the number of elements affect the equalization process using the bit
error rate (BER) as a metric, and demonstrate the potential of the DA-SIS in
equalization via comparing with digital equalizers as a benchmark. Finally, we
present opportunities and future research directions that can be undertaken to
bring this idea to fruition.

### [4] [A Drone-mounted Magnetometer System for Automatic Interference Removal and Landmine Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01417)
*Alex Paul Hoffmann,Matthew G. Finley,Eftyhia Zesta,Mark B. Moldwin,Lauro V. Ojeda*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 无人机搭载双磁力计，通过两步自动化干扰去除和地雷检测方法，实现低成本高效的地雷探测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地雷在冲突地区长期威胁平民安全，无人机磁力探测常受电子设备干扰，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 提出WAIC-UP方法去除干扰，再用RUDE算法检测地雷，结合双磁力计提升探测精度。

Result: 蒙特卡洛模拟验证了方法在随机地雷分布和无人机干扰下的高效性，且算法在不同高度表现稳定。

Conclusion: 两步WAIC-UP/RUDE方法能以低成本实现高保真地雷探测，简化磁性探测载荷设计。

Abstract: Landmines have been extensively used in conflict zones as an indiscriminate
weapon to control military movements, often remaining active long after
hostilities have ended. Their presence poses a persistent danger to civilians,
hindering post-war recovery efforts, causing injuries or death, and restricting
access to essential land for agriculture and infrastructure. Unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAV) equipped with magnetometers are commonly used to detect remnant
hidden landmines but come with significant technical challenges due to magnetic
field interference from UAV electronics such as motors. We propose the use of a
frame-mounted UAV-borne two-magnetometer payload to perform a two-step
automated interference removal and landmine detection analysis. The first step
removes interference via the Wavelet-Adaptive Interference Cancellation for
Underdetermined Platform (WAIC-UP) method designed for spaceflight
magnetometers. The second method uses the Rapid Unsupervised Detection of
Events (RUDE) algorithm to detect landmine signatures. This two-step
WAIC-UP/RUDE approach with multiple magnetometers achieves high-fidelity
ordinance detection at a low computational cost and simplifies the design of
magnetic survey payloads. We validate the method through a Monte Carlo
simulation of randomized landmine placements in a 10 x 10 m square grid and
drone motor interference. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of the algorithm
by varying the drone's altitude, examining its performance at different heights
above the ground.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了全双工基站（FD BS）配备可移动天线（MAs）的场景，同时为上下行用户提供通信服务并支持感知功能，优化目标是最大化捕获回波的SINR，并通过元学习方法解决非凸问题，取得接近最优的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索全双工基站与可移动天线结合的ISAC技术，以同时满足通信和感知需求，提升系统性能。

Method: 采用梯度元学习（GML）方法，联合优化发射和接收波束赋形向量、用户发射功率及天线位置，解决高耦合非凸问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方法达到最优解的99%，且优于多个基准方案。

Conclusion: 可移动天线结合元学习的方案在ISAC应用中具有显著优势，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates a full-duplex (FD) scenario where a base station (BS)
equipped with movable antennas (MAs) simultaneously provides communication
services to a set of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users while also enabling
sensing functionalities for target detection, thereby supporting integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) technology. Additionally, a receiving BS, also
equipped with MAs (denoted as BS R), is responsible for capturing the reflected
echo. To optimize this setup, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at
maximizing the signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) of the captured
echo. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors
at the FD BS, the receiving beamforming vectors at both the FD BS and BS R, the
UL users' transmit power, and the MAs' positions at both BSs, all while
satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for both sensing and
communication. Given the non-convex nature of the problem and the high coupling
between the variables, we employ a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach
tailored for large-scale optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning approach, achieving results within
99% of the optimal solution. Furthermore, the MA-based scheme outperforms
several benchmark approaches, highlighting its advantages in practical ISAC
applications.

### [6] [The Analysis and Performance of LODC-OFDM Signal in Nonlinear Rydberg Atomic Sensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01605)
*Hao Wu,Xinyuan Yao,Rui Ni,Chen Gong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于里德堡原子的传感器在射频测量中的非线性特性，提出了一种新型的局部振荡直流偏置OFDM（LODC-OFDM）方案，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 里德堡原子传感器在射频测量中表现出高灵敏度，但其光接口的单极性特性限制了传统OFDM信号的接收。

Method: 通过建立AM-AM特性的经验近似函数，并在直流偏置光学正交频分复用（DCO-OFDM）框架基础上提出LODC-OFDM方案，利用Bussgang定理分析非线性失真。

Result: 实验结果表明理论分析与实验结果吻合良好。

Conclusion: LODC-OFDM方案有效解决了里德堡原子传感器在宽带OFDM接收中的挑战。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors have been seen as novel radio frequency (RF)
measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it
attractive for communications reception. However, the signal sensing process in
Rydberg system involves sequential transduction from electromagnetic waves to
optical signals and finally to electrical signals. The unipolar characteristic
of the optical interface inherently restricts conventional OFDM reception.
Therefore, adopting unipolar OFDM schemes, inspired by optical communication
systems, becomes essential for compatible signal transmission. In this work, we
investigate the amplitude modulation-to-amplitude modulation (AM-AM)
characteristics of Rydberg atomic sensors, establishing an empirical
approximation function. Building on the direct current-biased optical
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) framework, we propose a
novel local oscillator direct current-biased OFDM (LODC-OFDM) scheme
specifically optimized for Rydberg-based sensing, effectively addressing the
broadband OFDM reception challenge. Then, we adopt Bussgang theorem to analyze
the nonlinear distortion of LODC-OFDM signals and the results in closed-form
solutions are derived for AM/AM curves approximated by Taylor series expansion
and for the ideal pre-distortion case. In real experiments, the experimental
and theoretical results fit well.

Motivation: 为了弥补此前研究中对选择合并（SC）系统的多样性增益部分描述的不足，本文旨在为1位量化的SIMO系统提供更全面的性能分析。

Method: 采用新颖的分析方法，在发射端使用QPSK调制，接收端采用最大比合并（MRC）的1位量化SIMO系统中，推导出精确的SEP表达式。

Result: 确定了SIMO-MRC系统的多样性和编码增益，并量化了任意接收天线数量下的SIMO-SC系统的多样性和编码增益。

Conclusion: 本文扩展并完善了先前的研究结果，为1位量化SIMO系统的性能分析提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: The average symbol error probability (SEP) of a 1-bit quantized single-input
multiple-output (SIMO) system is analyzed under Rayleigh fading channels and
quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Previous studies have
partially characterized the diversity gain for selection combining (SC). In
this paper, leveraging a novel analytical method, an exact analytical SEP
expression is derived for a 1-bit quantized SIMO system employing QPSK
modulation at the transmitter and maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the
receiver. The corresponding diversity and coding gains of a SIMO-MRC system are
also determined. Furthermore, the diversity and coding gains of a 1-bit
quantized SIMO-SC system are quantified for an arbitrary number of receive
antennas, thereby extending and complementing prior results.

### [8] [3D 8-Ary Noise Modulation Using Bayesian- and Kurtosis-based Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01748)
*Hadi Zayyani,Felipe A. P. de Figueiredo,Mohammad Salman,Rausley A. A. de Souza*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的三维8进制噪声调制方案，引入了混合高斯分布的新维度——混合概率，通过均值、方差和概率三个子通道传输信息，并使用多种检测器进行解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有噪声调制方案主要限于二维（均值和方差），限制了传输效率和灵活性，因此作者提出引入第三维度（混合概率）以提高数据速率和性能。

Method: 通过混合高斯分布的均值、方差和概率三个维度调制信息，针对每个子通道采用不同的检测器（阈值检测、最大似然检测、峰度检测、Jarque-Bera测试和贝叶斯假设检测）。

Result: 仿真结果显示，第三子通道的比特错误概率较低，数据速率比现有二维方案提高了1.5到3倍，峰度检测器复杂度低且性能可接受（BEP约为0.06）。

Conclusion: 提出的三维噪声调制方案显著提升了数据速率和传输效率，同时展示了多种检测器的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel three-dimensional (3D) 8-ary noise modulation
scheme that introduces a new dimension: the mixture probability of a Mixture of
Gaussian (MoG) distribution. This proposed approach utilizes the dimensions of
mean and variance, in addition to the new probability dimension. Within this
framework, each transmitted symbol carries three bits, each corresponding to a
distinct sub-channel. For detection, a combination of specialized detectors is
employed: a simple threshold based detector for the first sub-channel bit
(modulated by the mean), a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector for the second
sub-channel bit (modulated by the variance), a Kurtosis-based, Jarque-Bera (JB)
test, and Bayesian Hypothesis (BHT)-based detectors for the third bit
(modulated by the MoG probability). The Kurtosis- and JB-based detectors
specifically distinguish between Gaussian (or near-Gaussian) and non-Gaussian
MoG distributions by leveraging higher-order statistical measures. The Bit
Error Probabilities (BEPs) are derived for the threshold-, Kurtosis-, and
BHT-based detectors. The optimum threshold for the Kurtosis-based detector is
also derived in a tractable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that a
comparably low BEP is achieved for the third sub-channel bit relative to
existing two-dimensional (2D) schemes. Simultaneously, the proposed scheme
increases the data rate by a factor of 1.5 and 3 compared to the Generalized
Quadratic noise modulator and the classical binary KLJN noise modulator,
respectively. Furthermore, the Kurtosis-based detector offers a low-complexity
solution, achieving an acceptable BEP of approximately 0.06.

### [9] [Exactly or Approximately Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Estimation According to Wasserstein Radii Being Small or Large](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01763)
*Xiao Ding,Enbin Song,Dunbiao Niu,Zhujun Cao,Qingjiang Shi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了Wasserstein距离约束下线性测量模型的鲁棒估计问题，证明了无限维非凸极小极大问题与有限维问题的等价性，并提出可验证条件以判断鞍点存在性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在噪声分布和参数分布的Wasserstein距离约束下，解决线性测量模型中的鲁棒估计问题是一个具有挑战性的非凸极小极大问题，需探索鞍点存在性及其条件。

Method: 转化为有限维极小极大问题，提出基于凸问题及其对偶的可验证必要条件；在线性估计器限制下求解非凸极小极大问题。

Result: 证明了鞍点存在性与有限维问题的等价性，并通过数值实验验证了理论结果的有效性。

Conclusion: 当Wasserstein半径足够小时，鞍点总是存在；否则，线性估计器提供了一个有效的鲁棒估计上界。

Abstract: This paper primarily considers the robust estimation problem under
Wasserstein distance constraints on the parameter and noise distributions in
the linear measurement model with additive noise, which can be formulated as an
infinite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem. We prove that the existence of
a saddle point for this problem is equivalent to that for a finite-dimensional
minimax problem, and give a counterexample demonstrating that the saddle point
may not exist. Motivated by this observation, we present a verifiable necessary
and sufficient condition whose parameters can be derived from a convex problem
and its dual. Additionally, we also introduce a simplified sufficient
condition, which intuitively indicates that when the Wasserstein radii are
small enough, the saddle point always exists. In the absence of the saddle
point, we solve an finite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem, obtained by
restricting the estimator to be linear. Its optimal value establishes an upper
bound on the robust estimation problem, while its optimal solution yields a
robust linear estimator. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate
our theoretical results.

### [10] [Composite Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulation via Signal Addition: Towards Higher Dimensional Noise Modulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01776)
*Hadi Zayyani,Mohammad Salman,Felipe A. P. de Figueiredo,Rausley A. A. de Souza*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 通过叠加两个广义二次噪声调制器（GQNM）的输出，提出了一种16元噪声调制器，模拟了经典通信中的QAM调制器，并在理论上验证了其优于KLJN和GQNM调制器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过叠加GQNM调制器的输出，设计一种新型噪声调制器，以实现更高的调制阶数和更低的误码率。

Method: 通过简单地叠加两个GQNM调制器的输出，创建16元噪声调制器，并调节参数以满足理论可区分性条件。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在误码率方面优于KLJN和GQNM调制器，但增加了调制器、发射器和接收器检测器的复杂性。

Conclusion: 提出的16元噪声调制器在性能上优于现有调制器，未来可扩展至更高阶调制。

Abstract: This letter proposes superposing two Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulators
(GQNM) by simply adding their outputs. It creates a 16-ary noise modulator that
resembles QAM modulators in classical communication. It modulates the
information bits on four different means and four different variances. It could
also be applied to reach higher-order modulations than 16-ary schemes by adding
the outputs of more than two modulators, which is not discussed in detail in
this letter and left for future work. By selecting the parameters necessary for
satisfying the theoretical distinguishability conditions provided in the paper,
we can reach better performances in comparison to the Kirchhoff-Law Johnson
Noise (KLJN) modulator and the GQNM modulator, which is verified by the
simulations. The better result in terms of smaller Bit Error Probability (BEP)
is achieved by increasing the complexity in the modulator, the transmitter, and
the detectors in the receiver.

Method: 将ToA测量引入最小二乘（LS）多普勒成本函数，得到二次凸函数；利用线性约束问题求得闭式解，并提供无人机轨迹设计的闭式解。

Result: 仿真实验表明，所提算法在定位精度和计算效率上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该算法通过结合多普勒和ToA测量提高了定位性能，且计算效率高。

Abstract: In this paper, a single Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle (UAV)-aided localization
algorithm which uses both Doppler and Time of Arrival (ToA) measurements is
presented. In contrast to Doppler-based localization algorithms which are based
on non-convex functions, exploiting ToA measurements in a Least-Square (LS)
Doppler-based cost function, leads to a quadratic convex function whose
minimizer lies on a line. Utilizing the ToA measurements in addition to the
linear equation of minimizer, a closed form solution is obtained for the
emitter location using a constrained LS optimization. In addition, a trajectory
design of the UAV is provided which has also closed-form solution. Simulation
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in
comparison to some others in the literature.

Result: 仿真结果显示，所提算法优于固定位置天线，窄带优化接近最优性能。

Conclusion: MA位置优化能显著提升系统性能，尤其在低信噪比下简化算法有效。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology offers a flexible approach to enhancing
wireless channel conditions by adjusting antenna positions within a designated
region. While most existing works focus on narrowband MA systems, this paper
investigates MA position optimization for an MA-enhanced multiple-input
single-output (MISO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system.
This problem appears to be particularly challenging due to the frequency-flat
nature of MA positioning, which should accommodate the channel conditions
across different subcarriers. To overcome this challenge, we discretize the
movement region into a multitude of sampling points, thereby converting the
continuous position optimization problem into a discrete point selection
problem. Although this problem is combinatorial, we develop an efficient
partial enumeration algorithm to find the optimal solution using a
branch-and-bound framework, where a graph-theoretic method is incorporated to
effectively prune suboptimal solutions. In the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
regime, a simplified graph-based algorithm is also proposed to obtain the
optimal MA positions without the need for enumeration. Simulation results
reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed-position
antennas (FPAs), while narrowband-based antenna position optimization can
achieve near-optimal performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学模型仅能捕获部分噪声特性，无法全面统计非周期性异步脉冲噪声，需要一种更全面的方法来增强NB-PLC收发器的噪声处理能力。

Conclusion: NGGAN能够更准确地模拟实际NB-PLC系统中的噪声特性，为数据增强和噪声处理提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive
noise is a critical issue in enhancing impulse noise processing for narrowband
powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. However, existing mathematical
noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive
noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the
noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of
practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the
statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise
via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC
modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches
based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the
length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate
cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss
function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training
dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various
applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based
models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform
quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a
piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a
frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC
systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NGGAN trained using
waveform characteristics is closer to the practically measured dataset in terms
of the quality of the generated noise.

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition based on biosignals has shown strong potential for
developing intuitive human-machine interaction strategies that closely mimic
natural human behavior. In particular, sensor fusion approaches have gained
attention for combining complementary information and overcoming the
limitations of individual sensing modalities, thereby enabling more robust and
reliable systems. Among them, the fusion of surface electromyography (EMG) and
A-mode ultrasound (US) is very promising. However, prior solutions rely on
power-hungry platforms unsuitable for multi-day use and are limited to discrete
gesture classification. In this work, we present an ultra-low-power (sub-50 mW)
system for concurrent acquisition of 8-channel EMG and 4-channel A-mode US
signals, integrating two state-of-the-art platforms into fully wearable,
dry-contact armbands. We propose a framework for continuous tracking of 23
degrees of freedom (DoFs), 20 for the hand and 3 for the wrist, using a
kinematic glove for ground-truth labeling. Our method employs lightweight
encoder-decoder architectures with multi-task learning to simultaneously
estimate hand and wrist joint angles. Experimental results under realistic
sensor repositioning conditions demonstrate that EMG-US fusion achieves a root
mean squared error of $10.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$, compared to
$12.0^\circ\pm1^\circ$ for EMG and $13.1^\circ\pm2.6^\circ$ for US, and a R$^2$
score of $0.61\pm0.1$, with $0.54\pm0.03$ for EMG and $0.38\pm0.20$ for US.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于脏纸编码（DPC）的新型通信与计算集成（ICC）方案“Computing on Dirty Paper”，实现了在共享多接入信道中同时传输离散数据符号和计算nomographic函数的功能，并通过DPC原则预取消计算干扰以达到渐进无干扰的效果。

Motivation: 受到Costa脏纸编码（DPC）的启发，旨在解决通信与计算的集成问题，使两者能够在同一信道中高效共存。

Method: 提出了基于DPC的ICC方案，通过在发射端（TXs）预取消计算干扰，实现渐进无干扰的通信与计算集成。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方案在单输入多输出（SIMO）场景下显著优于现有ICC方案，降低了比特错误率（BER）和均方误差（MSE）。

Abstract: Inspired by Costa's pioneering work on dirty paper coding (DPC), this paper
proposes a novel scheme for integrated communication and computing (ICC), named
Computing on Dirty Paper, whereby the transmission of discrete data symbols for
communication, and over-the-air computation (AirComp) of nomographic functions
can be achieved simultaneously over common multiple-access channels. In
particular, the proposed scheme allows for the integration of communication and
computation in a manner that is asymptotically interference-free, by
precanceling the computing symbols at the transmitters (TXs) using DPC
principles. A simulation-based assessment of the proposed ICC scheme under a
single-input multiple-output (SIMO) setup is also offered, including the
evaluation of performance for data detection, and of mean-squared-error (MSE)
performance for function computation, over a block of symbols. The results
validate the proposed method and demonstrate its ability to significantly
outperform state-of-the-art (SotA) ICC schemes in terms of both bit error rate
(BER) and MSE.

TL;DR: 提出了Joint jammer Mitigation and Detection (JMD)新方法，联合估计干扰子空间与检测合法数据，无需专用训练阶段，适用于智能动态干扰机。


<details>

Motivation: 现有干扰抑制方法依赖训练阶段估计干扰空间，降低了通信速率且无法应对智能动态干扰机。

Result: 仿真表明JMD有效抑制了干扰机。

Conclusion: JMD无需专用训练阶段，能应对动态干扰机，提供了复杂度与性能的不同权衡方案。

Abstract: Multi-antenna (or MIMO) processing is a promising solution to the problem of
jammer mitigation. Existing methods mitigate the jammer based on an estimate of
its spatial signature that is acquired through a dedicated training phase. This
strategy has two main drawbacks: (i) it reduces the communication rate since no
data can be transmitted during the training phase and (ii) it can be evaded by
smart or multi-antenna jammers that do not transmit during the training phase
or that dynamically change their subspace through time-varying beamforming. To
address these drawbacks, we propose Joint jammer Mitigation and data Detection
(JMD), a novel paradigm for MIMO jammer mitigation. The core idea of JMD is to
estimate and remove the jammer interference subspace jointly with detecting the
legitimate transmit data over multiple time slots. Doing so removes the need
for a dedicated and rate-reducing training period while being able to mitigate
smart and dynamic multi-antenna jammers. We provide two JMD-type algorithms,
SANDMAN and MAED, that differ in the way they estimate the channels of the
legitimate transmitters and achieve different complexity-performance tradeoffs.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of JMD for jammer mitigation.

Conclusion: SE-AFDM系统在高移动性场景中具有显著的安全优势，同步框架的提出为解决快速时变信道中的同步问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has garnered significant
attention due to its superior performance in high-mobility scenarios, coupled
with multiple waveform parameters that provide greater degrees of freedom for
system design. This paper introduces a novel secure affine frequency division
multiplexing (SE-AFDM) system, which advances prior designs by dynamically
varying an AFDM pre-chirp parameter to enhance physical-layer security. In the
SE-AFDM system, the pre-chirp parameter is dynamically generated from a
codebook controlled by a long-period pseudo-noise (LPPN) sequence. Instead of
applying spreading in the data domain, our parameter-domain spreading approach
provides additional security while maintaining reliability and high spectrum
efficiency. We also propose a synchronization framework to solve the problem of
reliably and rapidly synchronizing the time-varying parameter in fast
time-varying channels. The theoretical derivations prove that unsynchronized
eavesdroppers cannot eliminate the nonlinear impact of the time-varying
parameter and further provide useful guidance for codebook design. Simulation
results demonstrate the security advantages of the proposed SE-AFDM system in
high-mobility scenarios, while our hardware prototype validates the
effectiveness of the proposed synchronization framework.

Result: 数值结果证明了所提框架的可行性和优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著提升DOA估计性能，并根据目标快照的先验知识实现部分或全面的姿态估计。

Abstract: This paper investigates joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) and attitude sensing
using tri-polarized continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs). By employing
electromagnetic (EM) information theory, the spatially continuous received
signals in tri-polarized CAPA are modeled, thereby enabling accurate DOA and
attitude estimation. To facilitate subspace decomposition for continuous
operators, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation technique is
developed. Moreover, both self- and cross-covariances of tri-polarized signals
are exploited to construct a tri-polarized spectrum, significantly enhancing
DOA estimation performance. Theoretical analyses reveal that the
identifiability of attitude information fundamentally depends on the
availability of prior target snapshots. Accordingly, two attitude estimation
algorithms are proposed: one capable of estimating partial attitude information
without prior knowledge, and the other achieving full attitude estimation when
such knowledge is available. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and
superiority of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 集成感知与通信（ISAC）的部署带来了前所未有的感知安全漏洞，需要开发解决方案以防止未经授权的被动雷达感知窃听者（Eve）提取信息。

Method: 提出了一种通过在ISAC信号的模糊函数中引入人工缺陷的方法，利用结构化子载波功率分配方案设计安全的自相关函数，并通过凸优化问题最大化ISAC性能。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的方法能够有效降低Eve的感知性能，同时保持合法系统的性能。

Conclusion: 论文成功实现了感知安全的ISAC信号设计，解决了未经授权感知的问题，为ISAC系统的安全部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: The deployment of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) brings along
unprecedented vulnerabilities to authorized sensing, necessitating the
development of secure solutions. Sensing parameters are embedded within the
target-reflected signal leaked to unauthorized passive radar sensing
eavesdroppers (Eve), implying that they can silently extract sensory
information without prior knowledge of the information data. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a sensing-secure ISAC framework that ensures secure
target detection and estimation for the legitimate system, while obfuscating
unauthorized sensing without requiring any prior knowledge of Eve. By
introducing artificial imperfections into the ambiguity function (AF) of ISAC
signals, we introduce artificial targets into Eve's range profile which
increase its range estimation ambiguity. In contrast, the legitimate sensing
receiver (Alice) can suppress these AF artifacts using mismatched filtering,
albeit at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. Employing an OFDM
signal, a structured subcarrier power allocation scheme is designed to shape
the secure autocorrelation function (ACF), inserting periodic peaks to mislead
Eve's range estimation and degrade target detection performance. To quantify
the sensing security, we introduce peak sidelobe level (PSL) and integrated
sidelobe level (ISL) as key performance metrics. Then, we analyze the three-way
trade-offs between communication, legitimate sensing, and sensing security,
highlighting the impact of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling on system
performance. We formulate a convex optimization problem to maximize ISAC
performance while guaranteeing a certain sensing security level. Numerical
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC
signaling, demonstrating its ability to degrade Eve's target estimation while
preserving Alice's performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于深度学习的低复杂度符号级预编码（SLP）框架，解决了传统SLP高复杂度的问题，并在不完美信道状态下保持优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLP方法虽然性能优越，但其高复杂度限制了实际应用。论文旨在通过深度学习框架降低复杂度，同时保持SLP的性能优势。

Method: 基于最优SLP闭式解的张量等变性（TE）设计端到端深度学习框架，引入参数共享模式和注意力模块，实现线性计算复杂度。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该框架在保持SLP性能的同时，实现了80倍的速度提升，并能泛化到不同用户数和符号块长度。

Conclusion: 论文提出的深度学习框架成功降低了SLP的复杂度，同时在不完美信道状态下表现优异，为SLP的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Although symbol-level precoding (SLP) based on constructive interference (CI)
exploitation offers performance gains, its high complexity remains a
bottleneck. This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the
structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent
tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input
induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the
computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known
closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP)
and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a
mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on
which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that
delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging
these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE
module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we
design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary
variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures
substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately
80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong
generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.

Motivation: 在GNSS缺失环境中，无人机的长距离飞行面临挑战，如测距漂移、无法在未知区域进行闭环以及计算资源受限。本文旨在解决这些问题，以实现可靠的自主飞行。

Conclusion: 文章总结了系统架构和定位流程，并提供了实际部署中的经验教训，为GNSS缺失环境下的无人机自主设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Reliable long-range flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-denied
environments is challenging: integrating odometry leads to drift, loop closures
are unavailable in previously unseen areas and embedded platforms provide
limited computational power. We present a fully onboard UAV system developed
for the SPRIN-D Funke Fully Autonomous Flight Challenge, which required 9 km
long-range waypoint navigation below 25 m AGL (Above Ground Level) without GNSS
or prior dense mapping. The system integrates perception, mapping, planning,
and control with a lightweight drift-correction method that matches
LiDAR-derived local heightmaps to a prior geo-data heightmap via
gradient-template matching and fuses the evidence with odometry in a clustered
particle filter. Deployed during the competition, the system executed
kilometer-scale flights across urban, forest, and open-field terrain and
reduced drift substantially relative to raw odometry, while running in real
time on CPU-only hardware. We describe the system architecture, the
localization pipeline, and the competition evaluation, and we report practical
insights from field deployment that inform the design of GNSS-denied UAV
autonomy.

Conclusion: 自适应膨胀策略降低了保守性，有效提升了船舶在狭窄空间中的导航能力。

Abstract: Safe motion planning is essential for autonomous vessel operations,
especially in challenging spaces such as narrow inland waterways. However,
conventional motion planning approaches are often computationally intensive or
overly conservative. This paper proposes a safe motion planning strategy
combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).
We introduce a time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation, where the
inflation radius is adjusted depending on the relative position and attitude
between the vessel and the obstacle. The proposed adaptive inflation reduces
the conservativeness of the controller compared to traditional fixed-ellipsoid
obstacle formulations. The MPC solution provides an approximate motion plan,
and high-order CBFs ensure the vessel's safety using the varying inflation
radius. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed
strategy enables the fully-actuated autonomous robot vessel to navigate through
narrow spaces in real time and resolve potential deadlocks, all while ensuring
safety.

Conclusion: 该方法计算复杂度低，适用于实时系统，且在实际应用中展现了良好性能。

Abstract: State estimation techniques for continuum robots (CRs) typically involve
using computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations,
or are limited to quasi-static methods. These limitations can be sensitive to
unmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph
optimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state
estimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on
continuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process
(GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show
adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result
contains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity,
and strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space.
This same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for
inclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated. Our
method's inherent sparsity leads to a linear solve complexity with respect to
time and interpolation queries in constant time. We demonstrate our method on a
CR with gyroscope and pose sensors, highlighting its versatility in real-world
systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需要在开放世界中适应多样化的人类指令并安全运行，但现有视觉语言模型难以直接用于导航任务。

Method: VENTURA通过微调预训练的图像扩散模型生成视觉路径掩码，并使用行为克隆策略将其转化为可执行轨迹。

Result: 在真实世界评估中，VENTURA在多个任务上的成功率提升33%，碰撞率降低54%，并能泛化到未见过的任务组合。

Conclusion: VENTURA展现了高效的导航能力和对新任务组合的适应性，为开放世界机器人导航提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in
unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)
offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult
to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining
objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing
this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes
internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of
directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a
visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware
navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these
visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows
natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale
training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking
models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level
annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world
evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on
object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving
success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen
scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of
distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities. Videos, code,

Motivation: 现有VLA模型缺乏预测失败和主动求助的内省机制，INSIGHT旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于π0-FAST模型提取令牌级不确定性信号，并训练紧凑的Transformer分类器进行求助触发预测。

Result: 强监督能捕捉精细不确定性动态，弱监督在训练与评估一致时也有竞争力。

Conclusion: 不确定性动态建模为VLA提供了预测能力，为主动学习和选择性干预开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalization
capabilities, yet they lack introspective mechanisms for anticipating failures
and requesting help from a human supervisor. We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a
learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict
when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we
extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based
estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact
transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore
supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare
them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a
trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty
dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still
support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned,
offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we
find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals
with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static
sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of
uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active
learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human
intervention.

Motivation: 现有方法在密集动态环境中过于保守且易导致优化不可行，亟需一种更灵活的安全约束方法。

Method: 设计了动态抛物线控制屏障函数（DPCBF），根据障碍物距离和相对速度动态调整安全边界。

Result: 仿真验证表明，DPCBF在密集环境中（高达100个动态障碍物）显著提高了导航成功率和优化可行性。

Conclusion: DPCBF为复杂环境中的机器人安全控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for ensuring the safety
of autonomous systems, yet applying them to nonholonomic robots in cluttered,
dynamic environments remains an open challenge. State-of-the-art methods often
rely on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints which, by only
considering the angle of the relative velocity, are inherently conservative and
can render the CBF-based quadratic program infeasible, particularly in dense
scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control
Barrier Function (DPCBF) that defines the safe set using a parabolic boundary.
The parabola's vertex and curvature dynamically adapt based on both the
distance to an obstacle and the magnitude of the relative velocity, creating a
less restrictive safety constraint. We prove that the proposed DPCBF is valid
for a kinematic bicycle model subject to input constraints. Extensive
comparative simulations demonstrate that our DPCBF-based controller
significantly enhances navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to
baseline methods. Our approach successfully navigates through dense
environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles, scenarios where collision
cone-based methods fail due to infeasibility.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have shown impressive results in robot imitation learning,
even for tasks that require satisfaction of kinematic equality constraints.
However, task performance alone is not a reliable indicator of the policy's
ability to precisely learn constraints in the training data. To investigate, we
analyze how well diffusion policies discover these manifolds with a case study
on a bimanual pick-and-place task that encourages fulfillment of a kinematic
constraint for success. We study how three factors affect trained policies:
dataset size, dataset quality, and manifold curvature. Our experiments show
diffusion policies learn a coarse approximation of the constraint manifold with
learning affected negatively by decreases in both dataset size and quality. On
the other hand, the curvature of the constraint manifold showed inconclusive
correlations with both constraint satisfaction and task success. A hardware
evaluation verifies the applicability of our results in the real world. Project

Motivation: 解决现有视觉学习方法计算量大、背景干扰多的问题，同时克服关键点方法依赖手动启发式或任务耦合的局限性。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1）可用性过滤；2）类别级关键点构建；3）基于transformer的策略学习，并嵌入门控机制筛选相关关键点。

Conclusion: AFFORD2ACT在无需密集表示的情况下表现出色，适用于广泛的操作任务，具有高可扩展性和语义理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-based robot learning often relies on dense image or point-cloud
inputs, which are computationally heavy and entangle irrelevant background
features. Existing keypoint-based approaches can focus on manipulation-centric
features and be lightweight, but either depend on manual heuristics or
task-coupled selection, limiting scalability and semantic understanding. To
address this, we propose AFFORD2ACT, an affordance-guided framework that
distills a minimal set of semantic 2D keypoints from a text prompt and a single
image. AFFORD2ACT follows a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering,
category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning
with embedded gating to reason about the most relevant keypoints, yielding a
compact 38-dimensional state policy that can be trained in 15 minutes, which
performs well in real-time without proprioception or dense representations.
Across diverse real-world manipulation tasks, AFFORD2ACT consistently improves
data efficiency, achieving an 82% success rate on unseen objects, novel
categories, backgrounds, and distractors.

Abstract: Robotic automation is accelerating scientific discovery by reducing manual
effort in laboratory workflows. However, precise manipulation of powders
remains challenging, particularly in tasks such as transport that demand
accuracy and stability. We propose a trajectory optimisation framework for
powder transport in laboratory settings, which integrates differentiable
physics simulation for accurate modelling of granular dynamics, low-dimensional
skill-space parameterisation to reduce optimisation complexity, and a
curriculum-based strategy that progressively refines task competence over long
horizons. This formulation enables end-to-end optimisation of contact-rich
robot trajectories while maintaining stability and convergence efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
task success rates and stability compared to the reinforcement learning
baseline.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种用于乳腺癌手术中肿瘤边界定位的协作机器人引导系统，并通过模拟实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌手术中，肿瘤边界难以精确划定，现有方法存在挑战。

Method: 改造小型触觉机器人，结合超声波和电磁导航，设置虚拟禁入区域辅助手术。

Result: 触觉反馈改善了切除边缘，减轻了医生的心理负担和工作强度。

Conclusion: 虚拟禁入区域在模拟手术中有效，未来将进行更广泛的用户研究。

Abstract: Purpose: Delineating tumor boundaries during breast-conserving surgery is
challenging as tumors are often highly mobile, non-palpable, and have
irregularly shaped borders. To address these challenges, we introduce a
cooperative robotic guidance system that applies haptic feedback for tumor
localization. In this pilot study, we aim to assess if and how this system can
be successfully integrated into breast cancer care.
  Methods: A small haptic robot is retrofitted with an electrocautery blade to
operate as a cooperatively controlled surgical tool. Ultrasound and
electromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and
position. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool
collides with the tumor boundary. We conducted a study where users were asked
to resect tumors from breast simulants both with and without the haptic
guidance. We then assess the results of these simulated resections both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
  Results: Virtual fixture guidance is shown to improve resection margins. On
average, users find the task to be less mentally demanding, frustrating, and
effort intensive when haptic feedback is available. We also discovered some
unanticipated impacts on surgical workflow that will guide design adjustments
and training protocol moving forward.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that virtual fixtures can help localize tumor
boundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery. Future work will include an
extensive user study to further validate these results and fine-tune our
guidance system.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for robot navigation but
encounter fundamental limitations: they lack persistent scene memory, offer
limited spatial reasoning, and do not scale effectively with video duration for
real-time application. We present VL-KnG, a Visual Scene Understanding system
that tackles these challenges using spatiotemporal knowledge graph construction
and computationally efficient query processing for navigation goal

modern VLMs, creates persistent knowledge graphs that maintain object identity
over time, and enables explainable spatial reasoning through queryable graph
structures. We also introduce WalkieKnowledge, a new benchmark with about 200
manually annotated questions across 8 diverse trajectories spanning
approximately 100 minutes of video data, enabling fair comparison between
structured approaches and general-purpose VLMs. Real-world deployment on a
differential drive robot demonstrates practical applicability, with our method
achieving 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy, matching Gemini 2.5
Pro performance while providing explainable reasoning supported by the
knowledge graph, computational efficiency for real-time deployment across
different tasks, such as localization, navigation and planning. Code and

Conclusion: 该方法可以利用步态输入空间的重叠性，减少训练数据需求并提升滤波器在多步态环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work demonstrates pose (position and shape) estimation for a
free-floating, bioinspired multi-link robot with unactuated joints,
link-mounted thrusters for control, and a single gyroscope per link, resulting
in an underactuated, minimally sensed platform. Through a proof-of-concept
hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the
robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an
unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to
compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter
trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning)
performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when
both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results
reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce
training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across
multiple gaits.

Motivation: 现有机器人导航方法在复杂环境中存在分辨率控制、可扩展性差或需大量演示数据的问题，ANTFields虽具潜力但仍面临谱偏差和灾难性遗忘等挑战。

Result: 在大型环境中验证了框架的适应性和精确性，优于现有方法，适用于在线探索与实时导航。

Conclusion: 分层物理信息策略有效克服谱偏差等问题，提升了复杂环境中的导航性能。

Abstract: Robot navigation in large, complex, and unknown indoor environments is a
challenging problem. The existing approaches, such as traditional
sampling-based methods, struggle with resolution control and scalability, while
imitation learning-based methods require a large amount of demonstration data.
Active Neural Time Fields (ANTFields) have recently emerged as a promising
solution by using local observations to learn cost-to-go functions without
relying on demonstrations. Despite their potential, these methods are hampered
by challenges such as spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting, which diminish
their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these issues, our approach
decomposes the planning problem into a hierarchical structure. At the high
level, a sparse graph captures the environment's global connectivity, while at
the low level, a planner based on neural fields navigates local obstacles by
solving the Eikonal PDE. This physics-informed strategy overcomes common
pitfalls like spectral bias and neural field fitting difficulties, resulting in
a smooth and precise representation of the cost landscape. We validate our
framework in large-scale environments, demonstrating its enhanced adaptability
and precision compared to previous methods, and highlighting its potential for
online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time multi-plane segmentation method based on
GPU-accelerated high-resolution 3D voxel mapping for legged robot locomotion.
Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and
computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors
suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot
represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane
segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these
limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based
connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection
and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar
regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and
accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a
resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time
for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged
robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D
planar structures.

Result: 系统支持穿戴式数据收集和标准机械臂部署，实现了高效的双手机器操作。

Conclusion: MiniBEE系统在提升灵活性和便携性的同时，为模仿学习策略提供了有效的数据收集工具。

Abstract: Bimanual robot manipulators can achieve impressive dexterity, but typically
rely on two full six- or seven- degree-of-freedom arms so that paired grippers
can coordinate effectively. This traditional framework increases system
complexity while only exploiting a fraction of the overall workspace for
dexterous interaction. We introduce the MiniBEE (Miniature Bimanual
End-effector), a compact system in which two reduced-mobility arms (3+ DOF
each) are coupled into a kinematic chain that preserves full relative
positioning between grippers. To guide our design, we formulate a kinematic
dexterity metric that enlarges the dexterous workspace while keeping the
mechanism lightweight and wearable. The resulting system supports two
complementary modes: (i) wearable kinesthetic data collection with self-tracked
gripper poses, and (ii) deployment on a standard robot arm, extending dexterity
across its entire workspace. We present kinematic analysis and design
optimization methods for maximizing dexterous range, and demonstrate an
end-to-end pipeline in which wearable demonstrations train imitation learning
policies that perform robust, real-world bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: We present ActiveUMI, a framework for a data collection system that transfers
in-the-wild human demonstrations to robots capable of complex bimanual
manipulation. ActiveUMI couples a portable VR teleoperation kit with sensorized
controllers that mirror the robot's end-effectors, bridging human-robot
kinematics via precise pose alignment. To ensure mobility and data quality, we
introduce several key techniques, including immersive 3D model rendering, a
self-contained wearable computer, and efficient calibration methods.
ActiveUMI's defining feature is its capture of active, egocentric perception.
By recording an operator's deliberate head movements via a head-mounted
display, our system learns the crucial link between visual attention and
manipulation. We evaluate ActiveUMI on six challenging bimanual tasks. Policies
trained exclusively on ActiveUMI data achieve an average success rate of 70\%
on in-distribution tasks and demonstrate strong generalization, retaining a
56\% success rate when tested on novel objects and in new environments. Our
results demonstrate that portable data collection systems, when coupled with
learned active perception, provide an effective and scalable pathway toward
creating generalizable and highly capable real-world robot policies.

Conclusion: FailSafe填补了故障恢复数据的空白，为机器人操作的鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic
control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve
strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale
crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures
during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from
unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing
robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real
world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable
to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure
detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to
utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a
novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces
diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be
seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable
creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune
LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results
show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from
potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA
models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several
tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different
spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to
release the FailSafe code to the community.

Result: 在EuRoC数据集上测试，平均平移误差减少24%，旋转误差减少42%。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时运行中提高了精度和鲁棒性，源代码将公开以促进研究。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robust visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is to
dynamically assess the reliability of sensor measurements. This assessment is
crucial for properly weighting the contribution of each measurement to the
state estimate. Conventional methods often simplify this by assuming a static,
uniform uncertainty for all measurements. This heuristic, however, may be
limited in its ability to capture the dynamic error characteristics inherent in
real-world data. To improve this limitation, we present a statistical framework
that learns measurement reliability assessment online, directly from sensor
data and optimization results. Our approach leverages multi-view geometric
consistency as a form of self-supervision. This enables the system to infer
landmark uncertainty and adaptively weight visual measurements during
optimization. We evaluated our method on the public EuRoC dataset,
demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy with average reductions of
approximately 24\% in translation error and 42\% in rotation error compared to
baseline methods with fixed uncertainty parameters. The resulting framework
operates in real time while showing enhanced accuracy and robustness. To
facilitate reproducibility and encourage further research, the source code will
be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决多步骤动态环境操纵中IL缺乏组合泛化和TAMP规划延迟高的问题。

Method: 离线学习谓词、操作符和技能，在线通过符号规划器组合技能并实时恢复。

Result: 在仿真中实现了12项单步任务85%成功率和多步任务稳健恢复，在真实机器人上成功演示了多任务执行。

Conclusion: SymSkill实现了组合性、实时性和安全性，适用于动态环境的实时操纵任务。

Abstract: Multi-step manipulation in dynamic environments remains challenging. Two
major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is
reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not
decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion
planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency,
preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified
learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing
compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline,
SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from
unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a
conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner
to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while
performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time.
Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted
execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation,
SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without
additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to
6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real
Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented
and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal
specifications. The source code and additional analysis can be found on

Conclusion: 所提控制器显著提升了性能和稳定性，尤其在极端飞行任务中表现突出。

Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt
omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor
dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and
reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery
from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware
control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on
linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture
the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit
the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its
nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and
establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal
parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we
demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such
uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not
account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast
translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden
disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking
performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the
fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the
proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks,
thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: PolySim有效缩小了仿真与现实间的差距，展示了跨平台训练的潜力。

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body control (WBC) policies trained in simulation often suffer
from the sim-to-real gap, which fundamentally arises from simulator inductive
bias, the inherent assumptions and limitations of any single simulator. These
biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between
simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive
bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,
encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond
any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training
platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch
parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single
training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization.
Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator
inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim
substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for
example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim
baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1
without additional fine-tuning, showing effective transfer from simulation to
the real world. We will release the PolySim code upon acceptance of this work.

Motivation: 现有的VLA模型虽然能够利用预训练的VLMs进行机器人操控，但其表示对机器人信号（如控制动作和本体感受状态）的敏感性不足，导致性能受限。

Method: 引入RS-CL，通过使用机器人状态间的相对距离作为软监督，补充原有的动作预测目标，从而优化VLA模型的表示学习。

Result: 实验表明，RS-CL显著提升了VLA模型的操控性能，如在RoboCasa-Kitchen中的拾取任务中成功率从30.8%提升至41.5%，在实际机器人任务中成功率从45.0%提升至58.3%。

Conclusion: RS-CL是一种轻量级且兼容现有VLA训练流程的方法，能够有效提升机器人操控任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot
manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain
suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and
proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware
Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization
for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and
robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely
with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the
states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction
objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning,
while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training
pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves
the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the
prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen,
through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts
success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: 新型MCR设计结合了多功能变形和精确载荷投递能力，为下一代精准治疗提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs) enable minimally invasive navigation through
tortuous anatomical channels, yet axially magnetized designs have largely been
limited to bending-only motion. To expand deformation capabilities, this paper
presents a simple assembly that embeds permanent magnets radially within the
catheter wall, allowing a single externally steered permanent magnet to
independently induce either bending or torsion. A physics-based formulation
together with finite-element analysis establishes the actuation principles, and
benchtop experiments validate decoupled mode control under practical fields.
Building on this, a dual-layer blockage mechanism consisting of outer grooves
and inner plates leverages torsional shear to achieve on-demand drug release.
Finally, an in-phantom intervention experiment demonstrates end-to-end
operation: lumen following by bending for target approach, followed by

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFE求解器仅适用于少量机器的工厂，无法满足现代包含数百台机器的智能工厂需求。

Method: 提出TS-ACES（基于交通系统的任意时间循环嵌入求解器），通过优化机器分配和运输路径来解决SFE问题。

Result: TS-ACES在大规模工业场景中表现优异，可扩展到超过100台机器的工厂。

Conclusion: TS-ACES填补了智能工厂大规模嵌入问题的空白，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modern automated factories increasingly run manufacturing procedures using a
matrix of programmable machines, such as 3D printers, interconnected by a
programmable transport system, such as a fleet of tabletop robots. To embed a
manufacturing procedure into a smart factory, an operator must: (a) assign each
of its processes to a machine and (b) specify how agents should transport parts
between machines. The problem of embedding a manufacturing process into a smart
factory is termed the Smart Factory Embedding (SFE) problem. State-of-the-art
SFE solvers can only scale to factories containing a couple dozen machines.
Modern smart factories, however, may contain hundreds of machines. We fill this
hole by introducing the first highly scalable solution to the SFE, TS-ACES, the
Traffic System based Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver. We show that TS-ACES is
complete and can scale to SFE instances based on real industrial scenarios with
more than a hundred machines.

TL;DR: Nav-EE框架通过导航先验动态选择退出层，显著降低推理延迟同时保持精度，适用于自动驾驶中的实时决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Early-exit方法因任务依赖性难以泛化，而自动驾驶可以通过导航系统预测场景需求，从而优化任务选择。

Method: 提出Nav-EE框架，离线预计算任务特定退出层，在线根据导航先验动态应用，结合CODA、Waymo等数据集验证。

Result: Nav-EE在保持精度前提下减少推理延迟高达63.9%，实车测试中延迟从600ms降至300ms。

Conclusion: 导航预见性与Early-exit结合为大型模型在自动驾驶中的高效部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving
for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders
real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at
intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across
diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous
driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g.,
intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We
propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes
task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on
navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE
achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to
63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates
reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making
in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight
with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large
models in autonomous systems. Code and data are available at our anonymous
repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Nav-EE-BBC4

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究物体导航（ObjectNav）的关键挑战，探索强化学习中哪些组件真正影响性能，为未来的研究提供指导。

Method: 将模块化强化学习系统分解为感知、策略和测试时增强三个组件，通过对比实验分析它们的贡献。

Result: 感知质量和测试时策略是性能的关键驱动因素，新系统在SPL和成功率上分别提升了6.6%和2.7%，但仍远低于人类表现（98%成功率）。

Conclusion: 研究为未来物体导航系统的设计和评估提供了实用指南，并展示了当前强化学习代理与人类水平的差距。

Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) is a critical component toward deploying
mobile robots in everyday, uncontrolled environments such as homes, schools,
and workplaces. In this context, a robot must locate target objects in
previously unseen environments using only its onboard perception. Success
requires the integration of semantic understanding, spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon planning, which is a combination that remains extremely
challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant
paradigm, progress has spanned a wide range of design choices, yet the field
still lacks a unifying analysis to determine which components truly drive
performance. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of modular
RL-based ObjectNav systems, decomposing them into three key components:
perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. Through extensive controlled
experiments, we isolate the contribution of each and uncover clear trends:
perception quality and test-time strategies are decisive drivers of
performance, whereas policy improvements with current methods yield only
marginal gains. Building on these insights, we propose practical design
guidelines and demonstrate an enhanced modular system that surpasses
State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods by 6.6% on SPL and by a 2.7% success rate. We
also introduce a human baseline under identical conditions, where experts
achieve an average 98% success, underscoring the gap between RL agents and
human-level navigation. Our study not only sets the SotA performance but also
provides principled guidance for future ObjectNav development and evaluation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种创新的时空轨迹规划方法，用于人形机器人的足球踢球动作，解决了传统方法在腿摆动过程中的简化问题，显著提升了踢球任务的完成精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人在执行足球踢球动作时，传统的位置控制方法和强化学习方法存在局限性，尤其是腿摆动过程的简化严重影响了脚的交互能力。为此，研究希望优化这一过程。

Method: 论文创新性地将无人机中成功的时空轨迹规划方法应用于双足机器人系统，自动生成满足踢球位置、速度和加速度约束的脚部轨迹，并优化摆动阶段时长。

Result: 优化的轨迹能够模仿人类的踢球行为（如回摆动作），轨迹规划时间小于1毫秒，在足球门范围为-90°至90°时，任务完成准确率接近100%。

Conclusion: 该方法在人形机器人踢球任务中表现出高效性和可靠性，为解决腿摆动简化问题提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in
maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving
precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional
position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches,
exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent
approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated
advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing
progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This
severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering
tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal
trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to
bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot
trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and
acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental
results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking
behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments
confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms,
and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the
soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.

Conclusion: GreenhouseSplat是首个面向温室规模的辐射场仿真框架，为农业机器人研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Simulating greenhouse environments is critical for developing and evaluating
robotic systems for agriculture, yet existing approaches rely on simplistic or
synthetic assets that limit simulation-to-real transfer. Recent advances in
radiance field methods, such as Gaussian splatting, enable photorealistic
reconstruction but have so far been restricted to individual plants or
controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we introduce GreenhouseSplat, a
framework and dataset for generating photorealistic greenhouse assets directly
from inexpensive RGB images. The resulting assets are integrated into a
ROS-based simulation with support for camera and LiDAR rendering, enabling
tasks such as localization with fiducial markers. We provide a dataset of 82
cucumber plants across multiple row configurations and demonstrate its utility
for robotics evaluation. GreenhouseSplat represents the first step toward
greenhouse-scale radiance-field simulation and offers a foundation for future
research in agricultural robotics.

TL;DR: TACOS是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的统一框架，支持通过自然语言控制多无人机系统，减少飞行员工作负荷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单飞行员管理多无人机系统时，任务需求从直接控制到自主群体行为，需灵活的共享自治模式。

Result: TACOS在真实多无人机系统中验证，并通过消融研究评估各模块贡献。

Conclusion: TACOS通过LLM实现语义推理与实时多机器人协调的桥接，展示了高效的自然语言控制能力。

Abstract: When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the
task demands varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual
UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for
accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a
framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models
continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural
foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level
task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we
present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified
framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems
through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities
into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for
intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user
intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans
interacting with the real-world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library
of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot
coordination. We demonstrate the system in real-world multi-drone system and
conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.

Motivation: 研究四足机器人脊柱的柔性和可控性，提供便携式平台以系统性研究脊柱在腿部运动中的作用。

Method: 采用RNEA计算加速度控制器和Stribeck摩擦补偿，实现无需惯性整形的弹簧-阻尼行为控制。

Result: 实验显示线性力-位移特性和质量-弹簧-阻尼响应，刚度范围300-700 N/m，误差≤1.5%。

Conclusion: SPARC为研究脊柱柔性和腿部运动提供了高效平台，并将公开硬件和固件资源。

Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module
that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable
task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three
torque-controlled actuators, a custom 1 kHz control board, and a protected
power unit in a 1.26 kg package, enabling closed-loop stiffness and damping
shaping along x, z, and theta. We develop an RNEA-based computed-acceleration
controller with smooth Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper
behavior without explicit inertia shaping. Bench experiments validate the
approach. Quasi-static push-pull tests show linear force-displacement
characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300-700 N/m and <=
1.5% relative error (R^2 >= 0.992, narrow 95% CIs). Dynamic
displace-and-release trials confirm mass-spring-damper responses over multiple
damping settings, with small, interpretable phase deviations due to
configuration-dependent inertia and low-speed friction effects. A task-space PD
controller produces roughly linear stiffness but with greater variability and
coupling sensitivity. SPARC provides a portable platform for systematic studies
of spine compliance in legged locomotion and will be released with complete
hardware and firmware resources.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模型预测控制(MPC)的运动提示算法，通过减少主观垂直冲突(SVC)模型预测的晕动症，同时优化模拟器的保真度和舒适度。实验表明，该算法显著降低了晕动症，且不影响保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶模拟器在研究和开发中广泛应用，但由于运动缩放和视觉不匹配，常导致晕动症。本文旨在通过优化运动提示算法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于MPC的运动提示算法，通过在成本函数中惩罚感官冲突和特定力误差，联合优化保真度和舒适度。

Result: 实验显示，该算法将晕动症平均降低了50%（MISC水平从3降至1.5），且保真度未显著下降。

Conclusion: 该算法综合考虑模拟器动力学和晕动症时间演变，为驾驶模拟器中的晕动症控制和特定力重现提供了显著改进。

Abstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development.
However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and
unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is
proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical
conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory
conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing
the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.
  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion
settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure
specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and
motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no
motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator
with participants exposed to passive driving.
  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model
predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the
lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The
compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5)
compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force
tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.
  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the
simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant
advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific
force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.

Motivation: 解决传统单目密集SLAM的高延迟、高内存消耗和依赖相机校准的问题。

Method: 耦合跟踪模块（稀疏特征点地图）和前馈3D重建模型（同时估计相机内参），并整合局部和全局闭环以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在多基准测试中表现优异，比现有方法更快、更省内存，适用于笔记本电脑等资源受限平台。

Conclusion: EC3R-SLAM在真实机器人应用中具有潜力，兼具高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The application of monocular dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) is often hindered by high latency, large GPU memory consumption, and
reliance on camera calibration. To relax this constraint, we propose EC3R-SLAM,
a novel calibration-free monocular dense SLAM framework that jointly achieves
high localization and mapping accuracy, low latency, and low GPU memory
consumption. This enables the framework to achieve efficiency through the
coupling of a tracking module, which maintains a sparse map of feature points,
and a mapping module based on a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that
simultaneously estimates camera intrinsics. In addition, both local and global
loop closures are incorporated to ensure mid-term and long-term data
association, enforcing multi-view consistency and thereby enhancing the overall
accuracy and robustness of the system. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that EC3R-SLAM achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, while being faster and more memory-efficient.
Moreover, it runs effectively even on resource-constrained platforms such as
laptops and Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its potential for real-world robotics
applications.

Result: LangGrasp能准确解析模糊指令，动态选择最佳抓取姿态，提高任务执行效率。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了机器人在非结构化环境中的适应性和操作效率。

Abstract: The existing language-driven grasping methods struggle to fully handle
ambiguous instructions containing implicit intents. To tackle this challenge,
we propose LangGrasp, a novel language-interactive robotic grasping framework.
The framework integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to leverage
their robust commonsense understanding and environmental perception
capabilities, thereby deducing implicit intents from linguistic instructions
and clarifying task requirements along with target manipulation objects.
Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part
segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby
extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained
part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework
accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying
critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for
task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by
integrating environmental information. This enables high-precision grasping
from object-level to part-level manipulation, significantly enhancing the
adaptability and task execution efficiency of robots in unstructured
environments. More information and code are available here:

Abstract: Stand-up motions are an indispensable part of humanoid robot soccer. A robot
incapable of standing up by itself is removed from the game for some time. In
this paper, we present our stand-up motions for the NAO robot. Our approach
dates back to 2019 and has been evaluated and slightly expanded over the past
six years. We claim that the main reason for failed stand-up attempts are large
errors in the executed joint positions. By addressing such problems by either
executing special motions to free up stuck limbs such as the arms, or by
compensating large errors with other joints, we significantly increased the
overall success rate of our stand-up routine. The motions presented in this
paper are also used by several other teams in the Standard Platform League,
which thereby achieve similar success rates, as shown in an analysis of videos
from multiple tournaments.

Abstract: We introduce the soft curvature and spectroscopy (SCANS) system: a versatile,

the spectral properties of objects either in hand or through pre-touch caging.
This platform offers a wider spectral sensing capability than previous soft
robotic counterparts. We perform a material analysis to explore optimal soft
substrates for spectral sensing, and evaluate both pre-touch and in-hand
performance. Experiments demonstrate explainable, statistical separation across
diverse object classes and sizes (metal, wood, plastic, organic, paper, foam),
with large spectral angle differences between items. Through linear
discriminant analysis, we show that sensitivity in the near-infrared
wavelengths is critical to distinguishing visually similar objects. These

Result: 通过电动车辆电池拆解案例验证，Bi-PAN能灵活高效地解决不同类型电池的拆解挑战。

Conclusion: 数字孪生技术和Bi-PAN范式为循环经济中的可持续性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In the context of the circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase
should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are
crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However,
manufacturers often do not support these processes enough by not sharing
relevant data. This paper proposes use of a digital twin technology, which is
capable to help optimizing the disassembly processes to reduce ecological
impact and enhance sustainability. The proposed approach is demonstrated
through a disassembly use-case of the product digital twin of an electric
vehicle battery. By utilizing product digital twins, challenges associated with
the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries can be solved flexibly and
efficiently for various battery types. As a backbone for the product digital
twin representation, the paper uses the paradigm of product-process-resource
asset networks (PAN). Such networks enable to model relevant relationships
across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific
production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a
product. This paper introduces a Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network
(Bi-PAN) representation, which extends the PAN paradigm to cover not only the
manufacturing, but also the remanufacturing/recycling phase.

Abstract: 3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments.
Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While
recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they
often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We
develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates
physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic
Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the
Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a
grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework
intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement
rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment.
Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating

Conclusion: FalconGym 2.0和PGR算法有效提升视觉策略的适应性，适用于无人机导航。

Abstract: Visual policy design is crucial for aerial navigation. However,
state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their
performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a
photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with
an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks
in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a
Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual
policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its
performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with
distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100%
success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under
gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a
quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30

Motivation: 人类和人形机器人之间的体现差距导致运动跟踪策略面临挑战，现有重定向方法引入的伪影影响了策略性能。

Method: 系统地评估重定向质量对策略性能的影响，并提出新的GMR方法，对比实验中使用BeyondMimic训练策略。

Conclusion: GMR是一种有效的运动重定向方法，能显著提升策略的鲁棒性和保真度。

Abstract: Humanoid motion tracking policies are central to building teleoperation
pipelines and hierarchical controllers, yet they face a fundamental challenge:
the embodiment gap between humans and humanoid robots. Current approaches
address this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and
then training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference
trajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot
sliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in
the reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has
demonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward
engineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when
excessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with
existing retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General
Motion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source
retargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source
dataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate
retargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset
of the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts
in retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for
dynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently outperforms existing open-source
methods in both tracking performance and faithfulness to the source motion,
achieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the
closed-source baseline. Website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过显式地将策略与相机外参关联来实现视角不变的模仿学习，发现外参条件化能显著提升行为克隆策略的跨视角泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视角不变模仿学习的重要性，并提出一种通过相机外参条件化来提高策略泛化能力的方法。

Method: 使用Plucker嵌入的像素射线，并评估了多种行为克隆策略（如ACT、Diffusion Policy和SmolVLA）。引入六个任务对策略在视角变化下的鲁棒性进行测试。

Result: 结果表明，未关联相机外参的策略依赖静态背景的视觉线索推断视角，而外参条件化能恢复性能并提供仅RGB输入的鲁棒控制。

Conclusion: 显式关联相机外参是一种有效提升视角不变性的方法，并为RGB-only控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning
policies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we
show that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization
across viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT,
Diffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic
viewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and
ManiSkill that pair "fixed" and "randomized" scene variants, decoupling
background cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without
extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in
fixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera
placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields
robust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,
and code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .

TL;DR: ARMADA是一个结合多机器人部署和人类共享控制的系统，通过FLOAT方法减少人工干预需求，显著提高任务成功率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模仿学习需要大量域内数据和人工监督，效率低且成本高。ARMADA旨在通过自主故障检测减少人工依赖，提升数据获取效率和适应性。

Method: 采用FLOAT方法进行自主在线故障检测，仅在必要时请求人工干预，实现并行策略部署和多轮后训练。

Result: FLOAT故障检测准确率达95%，远超现有方法20%；ARMADA任务成功率提升4倍，人工干预率降低一半。

Conclusion: ARMADA通过减少人工监督需求，显著提高了多机器人系统的部署效率和适应性。

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown promise in learning from large-scale real-world
datasets. However, pretrained policies usually perform poorly without
sufficient in-domain data. Besides, human-collected demonstrations entail
substantial labour and tend to encompass mixed-quality data and redundant
information. As a workaround, human-in-the-loop systems gather domain-specific
data for policy post-training, and exploit closed-loop policy feedback to offer
informative guidance, but usually require full-time human surveillance during
policy rollout. In this work, we devise ARMADA, a multi-robot deployment and
adaptation system with human-in-the-loop shared control, featuring an
autonomous online failure detection method named FLOAT. Thanks to FLOAT, ARMADA
enables paralleled policy rollout and requests human intervention only when
necessary, significantly reducing reliance on human supervision. Hence, ARMADA
enables efficient acquisition of in-domain data, and leads to more scalable
deployment and faster adaptation to new scenarios. We evaluate the performance
of ARMADA on four real-world tasks. FLOAT achieves nearly 95% accuracy on
average, surpassing prior state-of-the-art failure detection approaches by over
20%. Besides, ARMADA manifests more than 4$\times$ increase in success rate and
greater than 2$\times$ reduction in human intervention rate over multiple
rounds of policy rollout and post-training, compared to previous
human-in-the-loop learning methods.

*Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdrón-Hurtado,Leon Suarez,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NPN通过神经网络的零空间低维投影提升成像逆问题的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法忽视零空间的特定结构，NPN旨在设计可解释且灵活的零空间先验。

Method: 提出非线性零空间投影(NPN)，利用神经网络约束零空间的低维投影。

Result: NPN显著提升压缩感知、去模糊、超分辨等多种成像问题的重建精度。

Conclusion: NPN是一种可解释、灵活且兼容多种重建框架的新型正则化方法。

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Motivation: 传统工业组件的缺陷检测耗时耗力，给质检人员带来负担且难以管理产品质量。

Method: 使用数字相机光学和深度学习模型检测DIP的表面和引脚缺陷，并通过ConSinGAN生成数据集。研究了四种YOLO模型（v3、v4、v7、v9）及其与ConSinGAN的结合。

Result: YOLOv7与ConSinGAN结合的表现最佳，准确率达95.50%，检测时间为285毫秒，远超基于阈值的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自动化缺陷检测系统可轻松应用于多种缺陷或数据不足的情况，并结合了SCADA系统和传感器架构。

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

Result: VLA-R1在多个领域和平台上表现出卓越的泛化能力和实际应用性能。

Conclusion: VLA-R1通过系统性优化推理和执行，显著提升了VLA模型的性能，未来计划公开模型、代码和数据集。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver processing is a key
technology for current and next-generation wireless communications. However, it
faces significant challenges related to complexity and scalability as the
number of antennas increases. Artificial intelligence (AI), a cornerstone of
next-generation wireless networks, offers considerable potential for addressing
these challenges. This paper proposes an AI-driven, universal MIMO receiver
architecture based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Unlike
existing AI-based methods that treat receiver processing as a black box, our
MCMC-based approach functions as a generic Bayesian computing engine applicable
to various processing tasks, including channel estimation, symbol detection,
and channel decoding. This method enhances the interpretability, scalability,
and flexibility of receivers in diverse scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed
approach integrates these tasks into a unified probabilistic framework, thereby
enabling overall performance optimization. This unified framework can also be
seamlessly combined with data-driven learning methods to facilitate the
development of fully intelligent communication receivers.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of extracting common randomness (CR) or secret
keys from correlated random sources observed by two legitimate parties, Alice
and Bob, through public discussion in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. We
propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the
variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice
and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their
observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high
agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is
realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial
training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction
reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is
guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study
physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely
on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus
suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility
scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps
measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified
through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR)
measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's
position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of
both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation
method.

Conclusion: 联合语义相关性和信道状态的协作方法能显著提升无线环境下边缘推理的性能。

Abstract: We focus on collaborative edge inference over wireless, which enables
multiple devices to cooperate to improve inference performance in the presence
of corrupted data. Exploiting a key-query mechanism for selective information
exchange (or, group formation for collaboration), we recall the effect of
wireless channel impairments in feature communication. We argue and show that a
disjoint approach, which only considers either the semantic relevance or
channel state between devices, performs poorly, especially in harsh propagation
conditions. Based on these findings, we propose a joint approach that takes
into account semantic information relevance and channel states when grouping
devices for collaboration, by making the general attention weights dependent of
the channel information. Numerical simulations show the superiority of the
joint approach against local inference on corrupted data, as well as compared
to collaborative inference with disjoint decisions that either consider
application or physical layer parameters when forming groups.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the framework of collaborative inference, or edge
ensembles. This framework enables multiple edge devices to improve
classification accuracy by exchanging intermediate features rather than raw
observations. However, efficient communication strategies are essential to
balance accuracy and bandwidth limitations. Building upon a key-query mechanism
for selective information exchange, this work extends collaborative inference
by studying the impact of channel noise in feature communication, the choice of
intermediate collaboration points, and the communication-accuracy trade-off
across tasks. By analyzing how different collaboration points affect
performance and exploring communication pruning, we show that it is possible to
optimize accuracy while minimizing resource usage. We show that the
intermediate collaboration approach is robust to channel errors and that the
query transmission needs a higher degree of reliability than the data
transmission itself.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over

Conclusion: PPL通过合理选择偏好视界L，平衡风险状态覆盖与标签准确性，提高算法最优性。

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划代理在处理不完全观测环境时，往往忽视内部动态与实际环境的差异，导致决策不准确。

Method: 提出InfoSeeker框架，通过主动规划信息寻求行为（如验证理解或检测环境变化）来更新内部动态，优化决策。

Result: 实验表明，InfoSeeker在不牺牲样本效率的情况下，性能提升了74%，且在不同LLM和任务中表现稳定。

Conclusion: 研究表明，紧密结合规划和信息寻求对提升部分可观测环境中的稳健行为至关重要。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms

### [74] [Better Than "Better Than Nothing": Design Strategies for Enculturated Empathetic AI Robot Companions for Older Adults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01192)
*Isabel Pedersen,Andrea Slane*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出在老年人与机器人互动中模拟共情是关键，当前设计缺乏共情路径，应基于文化价值观整合情感AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善老年人与机器人互动的社交质量，填补共情设计在机器人护理中的空白。

Method: 运用修辞理论定义共情的社会文化期望，分析公共研究资料中机器人设计的共情缺失。

Result: 发现当前机器人设计忽视共情，提出以共情词汇为设计基础，强调情感AI需符合文化价值观。

Conclusion: 共情设计是提升老年人社交机器人互动效果的关键，需基于真实的共情文化价值观。

Abstract: The paper asserts that emulating empathy in human-robot interaction is a key
component to achieve satisfying social, trustworthy, and ethical robot
interaction with older people. Following comments from older adult study
participants, the paper identifies a gap. Despite the acceptance of robot care
scenarios, participants expressed the poor quality of the social aspect.
Current human-robot designs, to a certain extent, neglect to include empathy as
a theorized design pathway. Using rhetorical theory, this paper defines the
socio-cultural expectations for convincing empathetic relationships. It
analyzes and then summarizes how society understands, values, and negotiates
empathic interaction between human companions in discursive exchanges, wherein
empathy acts as a societal value system. Using two public research collections
on robots, with one geared specifically to gerontechnology for older people, it
substantiates the lack of attention to empathy in public materials produced by
robot companies. This paper contends that using an empathetic care vocabulary
as a design pathway is a productive underlying foundation for designing
humanoid social robots that aim to support older people's goals of
aging-in-place. It argues that the integration of affective AI into the
sociotechnical assemblages of human-socially assistive robot interaction ought
to be scrutinized to ensure it is based on genuine cultural values involving
empathetic qualities.

### [75] [A Control Theory inspired Exploration Method for a Linear Bandit driven by a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01364)
*Jonathan Gornet,Yilin Mo,Bruno Sinopoli*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文介绍了两种基于线性高斯动态系统的算法（Kalman-UCB和IDEA），用于解决探索与开发的权衡问题，并通过环境属性指标预测算法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维动作空间中探索与开发之间的平衡问题，尤其是机器学习中超参数优化等应用场景。

Method: 提出了Kalman-UCB和IDEA两种算法，前者基于乐观不确定性准则，后者结合奖励预测和状态预测误差最小化。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了基于LGDS属性的指标能有效预测算法性能。

Conclusion: IDEA在高维动作空间中表现更优，适用于实际应用中的探索与开发问题。

Abstract: The paper introduces a linear bandit environment where the reward is the
output of a known Linear Gaussian Dynamical System (LGDS). In this environment,
we address the fundamental challenge of balancing exploration -- gathering
information about the environment -- and exploitation -- selecting to the
action with the highest predicted reward. We propose two algorithms, Kalman
filter Upper Confidence Bound (Kalman-UCB) and Information filter Directed
Exploration Action-selection (IDEA). Kalman-UCB uses the principle of optimism
in the face of uncertainty. IDEA selects actions that maximize the combination
of the predicted reward and a term that quantifies how much an action minimizes
the error of the Kalman filter state prediction, which depends on the LGDS
property called observability. IDEA is motivated by applications such as
hyperparameter optimization in machine learning. A major problem encountered in
hyperparameter optimization is the large action spaces, which hinder the
performance of methods inspired by principle of optimism in the face of
uncertainty as they need to explore each action to lower reward prediction
uncertainty. To predict if either Kalman-UCB or IDEA will perform better, a
metric based on the LGDS properties is provided. This metric is validated with
numerical results across a variety of randomly generated environments.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对三无人机吊挂载荷系统的鲁棒神经控制设计，以在外界扰动下跟踪参考路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一种能够在外部扰动下稳定跟踪路径的控制系统，适用于无人机吊挂载荷运输。

Method: 结合了控制收缩度量（CCM）和扰动估计器（UDE），生成基线控制器并动态补偿扰动。

Result: 仿真表明，该控制系统能够在复杂轨迹和外部扰动下实现零跟踪误差。

Conclusion: 提出的框架展示了鲁棒性和模块化设计，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: This paper presents a robust neural control design for a three-drone slung
payload transportation system to track a reference path under external
disturbances. The control contraction metric (CCM) is used to generate a neural
exponentially converging baseline controller while complying with control input
saturation constraints. We also incorporate the uncertainty and disturbance
estimator (UDE) technique to dynamically compensate for persistent
disturbances. The proposed framework yields a modularized design, allowing the
controller and estimator to perform their individual tasks and achieve a zero
trajectory tracking error if the disturbances meet certain assumptions. The
stability and robustness of the complete system, incorporating both the CCM
controller and the UDE compensator, are presented. Simulations are conducted to
demonstrate the capability of the proposed control design to follow complicated
trajectories under external disturbances.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于时间约束的协同制导框架，确保在动态不确定环境下成功拦截敌对无人机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决空战中多无人机协同防御的复杂性和不确定性，保证高价值无人机的安全。

Result: 模拟验证表明该方法能在固定时间内驱动关键误差为零，成功完成任务。

Conclusion: 该方法在对抗性环境中具有实时自主防御的实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical aerial defense challenge in contested
airspace, involving three autonomous aerial vehicles -- a hostile drone (the
pursuer), a high-value drone (the evader), and a protective drone (the
defender). We present a cooperative guidance framework for the evader-defender
team that guarantees interception of the pursuer before it can capture the
evader, even under highly dynamic and uncertain engagement conditions. Unlike
traditional heuristic, optimal control, or differential game-based methods, we
approach the problem within a time-constrained guidance framework, leveraging
true proportional navigation based approach that ensures robust and guaranteed
solutions to the aerial defense problem. The proposed strategy is
computationally lightweight, scalable to a large number of agent
configurations, and does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy or
control laws. From arbitrary initial geometries, our method guarantees that key
engagement errors are driven to zero within a fixed time, leading to a
successful mission. Extensive simulations across diverse and adversarial
scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its relevance
for real-time autonomous defense in contested airspace environments.

*Zhengyang Shen,Xuehao Zhai,Hua Tu,Mayue Shi*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: CardioRAG是一种结合大型语言模型和可解释心电图特征的检索增强生成框架，用于提高Chagas心肌病的诊断准确性和临床适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chagas心肌病是一种严重并发症，现有AI诊断方法存在准确性低、依赖大数据集及与临床指标结合不足的问题。

Method: 提出CardioRAG框架，结合变分自编码器和临床心电图特征（如右束支传导阻滞），通过病例检索增强诊断。

Result: 召回率达89.80%，F1分数0.68，有效识别需优先血清检测的阳性病例。

Conclusion: CardioRAG为资源有限地区提供了一种可解释、基于临床证据的诊断方法，推动了可信医疗AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Chagas disease affects nearly 6 million people worldwide, with Chagas
cardiomyopathy representing its most severe complication. In regions where
serological testing capacity is limited, AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG)
screening provides a critical diagnostic alternative. However, existing machine
learning approaches face challenges such as limited accuracy, reliance on large
labeled datasets, and more importantly, weak integration with evidence-based
clinical diagnostic indicators. We propose a retrieval-augmented generation
framework, CardioRAG, integrating large language models with interpretable
ECG-based clinical features, including right bundle branch block, left anterior
fascicular block, and heart rate variability metrics. The framework uses
variational autoencoder-learned representations for semantic case retrieval,
providing contextual cases to guide clinical reasoning. Evaluation demonstrated
high recall performance of 89.80%, with a maximum F1 score of 0.68 for
effective identification of positive cases requiring prioritized serological
testing. CardioRAG provides an interpretable, clinical evidence-based approach
particularly valuable for resource-limited settings, demonstrating a pathway
for embedding clinical indicators into trustworthy medical AI systems.

### [79] [Authentication Security of PRF GNSS Ranging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02196)
*Jason Anderson*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文分析了基于伪随机函数（PRF）的GNSS测距在多种欺骗模型下的认证安全性，尤其是针对安全码估计与重放（SCER）欺骗模型。通过秘密密钥生成的测距码使欺骗者无法预测广播前的码序列，从而建立对GNSS伪距和PNT解的信任。研究应用于伽利略的信号认证服务（SAS），计算表明在非SCER模型中仅需400毫秒E6-C信号数据即可实现128位认证安全性；同时预测了SCER攻击者所需的无线电设备成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS系统中的测距码安全性至关重要，尤其是在面对多种欺骗攻击（如SCER）时，现有方法可能无法提供足够的认证安全性。研究旨在通过伪随机函数（PRF）改进GNSS测距的认证安全性，为设计更高安全性的协议提供支持。

Method: 通过分析PRF生成的GNSS测距码在秘密密钥保护下的不可预测性，推导其在多种欺骗模型（包括SCER）下的安全性。理论模型应用于伽利略的E6-C信号认证服务，计算所需数据量和攻击者成本。

Result: 研究表明，在非SCER模型中，仅需400毫秒伽利略E6-C信号即可实现128位认证安全性；对于SCER攻击者，预测了其破解认证所需的无线电设备成本。

Conclusion: PRF生成的GNSS测距码能够有效抵御多种欺骗攻击，显著提升GNSS系统的认证安全性。研究结果为设计满足特定安全需求的PRF测距协议提供了理论依据。

Abstract: This work derives the authentication security of pseudorandom function (PRF)
GNSS ranging under multiple GNSS spoofing models, including the Security Code
Estimation and Replay (SCER) spoofer. When GNSS ranging codes derive from a PRF
utilizing a secret known only to the broadcaster, the spoofer cannot predict
the ranging code before broadcast. Therefore, PRF ranging can be used to
establish trust in the GNSS pseudoranges and the resulting receiver position,
navigation, and timing (PNT) solution. I apply the methods herein to Galileo's
Signal Authentication Service (SAS) utilizing the encrypted Galileo E6-C signal
to compute that, at most, 400 ms of Galileo E6-C data to assert 128-bit
authentication security under non-SCER models. For the SCER adversary, I
predict the adversary's needed receiving radio equipment to break
authentication security. One can use this work to design a PRF GNSS ranging
protocol to meet useful authentication security requirements by computing the
probability of missed detection.
