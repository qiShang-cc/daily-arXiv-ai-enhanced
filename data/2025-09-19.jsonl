Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly\nfrom visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more\napplicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on\nrearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose\na method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining\nstructural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach\nleverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems,\nintegrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified\nframework.

Recently, the Model Predictive Path\nIntegral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the\nfirst two challenges.

This\napproach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.\nIn this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our\nframework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a\nmulti-turn dialogue.

Classical terrain-aware planners\nemphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods\ntypically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting\nenergy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning\nframework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,\nrotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid\nRTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and\ninstantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory\noptimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,\ndynamically feasible, and power-compliant.

To address these challenges, we propose a\nmethod, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque\nfeatures from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect\nanomalies.

Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are\ncomputationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time\nmethods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of\nfreedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this\nproblem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface\ndetection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is\nfirst employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat\nclusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be\neasily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.\nSurfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary\ndescription method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public\ndatasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the\nstate-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.\nMeanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian\nmixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer."}

As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and\na long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with\ndiverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large\nviewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and\nreference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely\non 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification\nframework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D\nreasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the\nfirst stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for\ngenerating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then\nestimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,\npreventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When\ninvoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a\n3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a\nkeypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences\nbetween query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity\nscoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior\nstate of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,\navoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs.

To overcome the resulting heterogeneity in target\nobservability, a fixed-time distributed observer is employed, enabling\nseeker-less interceptors to estimate the target state using information from\nseeker-equipped agents and local neighbors over a directed communication\ntopology. Departing from conventional strategies that approximate time-to-go\nvia linearization or small-angle assumptions, the proposed approach leverages\ndeviated pursuit guidance where the time-to-go expression is exact for such a\ntarget.

Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning\nstage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage\npost-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral\ncloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage,\nSelf-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a\nwell-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of\nrobots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human\nsupervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot\nembodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on\nEmbodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT\nand Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling\nimitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to\npolicies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight\nthat the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key\nto this sample-efficiency.
