At high speeds and in cluttered environments, Doppler shifts and rapid multipath changes can dramatically raise packet error rates. This paper investigates these phenomena in the context of ExpressLRS (ELRS) long-range FPV control links and demonstrates a novel solution: real-time geometry tuning of a circularly polarized helical antenna array. This study integrates Maxwell-equation-based full-wave simulations (via Ansys HFSS) with controlled, blind field trials to validate performance. A new analysis framework incorporates Doppler-induced frequency offset into the antenna's radiation pattern and the system's error model. Compared to a conventional fixed antenna, the adaptive helical array shows a 20-30% PER reduction when drones exceed 150 mph. The adaptive system automatically adjusts coil pitch and diameter to retune the antenna as flight parameters (velocity, attitude) change. Measured VSWR stays near unity, preventing transmitter reflection spikes. RSSI variation is reduced by half, indicating stronger link stability in urban multi-path. A regression analysis confirms that the reduction in PER due to tuning is highly statistically significant. Calibration data and error analyses are provided to validate our methodology. These findings advance the understanding of high-mobility UAV communication channels and demonstrate that reconfigurable hardware-here, mechanically tunable helices-can effectively counter Doppler and multi-path impairments. The findings inform new design principles for UAV antenna arrays and suggest a path toward AI-integrated adaptive RF systems for drone swarms and racing platforms."}

Given that acoustic waves represent an effective medium for long-distance transmission in aquatic environments, underwater acoustic target tracking has become a prominent research area of underwater communications and networking. Existing literature reviews often offer a narrow perspective or inadequately address the paradigm shifts driven by emerging technologies like deep learning and reinforcement learning. To address these gaps, this work presents a systematic survey of this field and introduces an innovative multidimensional taxonomy framework based on target scale, sensor perception modes, and sensor collaboration patterns. Within this framework, we comprehensively survey the literature (more than 180 publications) over the period 2016-2025, spanning from the theoretical foundations to diverse algorithmic approaches in underwater acoustic target tracking. Particularly, we emphasize the transformative potential and recent advancements of machine learning techniques, including deep learning and reinforcement learning, in enhancing the performance and adaptability of underwater tracking systems. Finally, this survey concludes by identifying key challenges in the field and proposing future avenues based on emerging technologies such as federated learning, blockchain, embodied intelligence, and large models."}

However, in practice, as the number of antennas at the access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this challenge, this paper considers a hybrid near-far field activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO, and establishes a covariance-based formulation, which facilitates the development of a distributed algorithm to alleviate the computational burden at the central processing unit (CPU). Specifically, each AP performs local activity detection for the devices and then transmits the detection result to the CPU for further processing. In particular, a novel coordinate descent algorithm based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury update with Taylor expansion is proposed to handle the local detection problem at each AP. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how the hybrid near-far field channels affect the detection performance. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing approaches."}

However, the dynamic nature of satellite channels and their inherent impairments present significant challenges. In this paper, a novel post-compensation scheme that combines the complex-valued extreme learning machine with augmented hidden layer (CELMAH) architecture and widely linear processing (WLP) is developed to address these issues by exploiting signal impropriety in satellite communications. Although CELMAH shares structural similarities with WLP, it employs a different core algorithm and does not fully exploit the signal impropriety. By incorporating WLP principles, we derive a tailored formulation suited to the network structure and propose the CELM augmented by widely linear least squares (CELM-WLLS) for post-distortion. The proposed approach offers enhanced communication robustness and is highly effective for satellite communication scenarios characterized by dynamic channel conditions and non-linear impairments. CELM-WLLS is designed to improve signal recovery performance and outperform traditional methods such as least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). Compared to CELMAH, CELM-WLLS demonstrates approximately 0.8 dB gain in BER performance, and also achieves a two-thirds reduction in computational complexity, making it a more efficient solution."}

In this paper, we discuss a special case of phase distortion known as phase-intercept distortion, which is created by a frequency-independent phase shift. We hypothesize that, though this form of distortion changes a signal's waveform significantly, the distortion is imperceptible. Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the imperceptibility of phase-intercept distortion can be useful for machine learning, specifically for data augmentation. We conducted multiple experiments using phase-intercept distortion as a novel approach to data augmentation, and obtained improved results for audio machine learning tasks."}

Yet, the stepwise impact ionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major source of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We further derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these expressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for cascade networks."}

This evolution is built upon a deepening understanding of the fundamental principles governing these ultra-low-power links. Modern backscatter systems are no longer simple reflectors of continuous waves but are increasingly designed to interact with complex, data-carrying ambient signals from ubiquitous sources like WiFi, ZigBee, and cellular networks. This review systematically charts the journey of ambient backscatter, particularly focusing on its interaction with ZigBee and other commodity wireless protocols over the last decade. We analyze the progression from foundational proof-of-concept systems that established productive backscatter to modern high-throughput, concurrent, and cross-technology communication architectures. Key advancements in fine-grained modulation, robust synchronization, cross-technology physical layer emulation, and multi-tag coordination are detailed. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art systems highlights the core trade-offs between performance metrics like data rate and range, power consumption, and compatibility with commodity hardware. Finally, we synthesize the primary challenges, including networking scalability, security vulnerabilities, the near-far problem, and practical deployment hurdles, and outline future research directions, such as integration with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and 6G networks, that promise to further expand the capabilities of this transformative technology."}

The proposed approach addresses the limitations of traditional radar-based ego-motion estimation techniques by employing a neural network to process complex-valued raw radar data and estimate instantaneous linear ego-velocity along with its associated uncertainty. This uncertainty-aware velocity estimate is then integrated with inertial measurement unit data using an Extended Kalman Filter. The filter leverages the network-predicted uncertainty to refine the inertial sensor's noise and bias parameters, improving the overall robustness and accuracy of the ego-motion estimation.

We comprehensively analyze the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the system wherein the users use the minimum mean-squared errorbased successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) scheme to detect the desired signals. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the user association and power control for maximizing the sum SE. The formulated problem is under per-AP transmit power and fronthaul constraints, and is based on only long-term channel state information (CSI). The challenging formulated problem is transformed into tractable form and a novel algorithm is proposed to solve it using minorization maximization (MM) technique. We analyze the trade-offs provided by the CF-mMIMO system with different number of CB clusters, hence highlighting the importance of the appropriate choice of CB design for different system setups.

When such errors are significant, considerable performance losses can be observed if the wireless transceiver is not adapted. Instead of refining the estimate by increasing the pilot sequence length or improving the estimation algorithm, we propose two new approaches based on Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) decoders. The first method involves testing multiple candidates for the channel estimate located in the complex neighborhood around the original pilot-based estimate. All these candidates are employed in parallel to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLR). These LLRs are used as soft input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). Posterior likelihood formulas associated with ORBGRAND are then computed to determine which channel candidate leads to the most probable codeword. The second method is a refined version of the first approach accounting for the presence of residual CEE in the LLR computation. The performance of these two techniques is evaluated for [128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar and CRC codes. For the considered settings, block error rate (BLER) gains of several dBs are observed compared to cases where CEE is ignored."}
