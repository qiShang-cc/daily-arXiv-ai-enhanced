In recent\nyears, learning models such as autoencoders (AE) have been studied for CSI\ncompression, aiming to eliminate model assumptions and reduce compression loss.\nHowever, current learning methods are often designed and trained mainly for\nindividual channel scenarios, with limited generalizability across different\nscenarios, of which the channel characteristics are prominently discrepant.\nMotivated by this, we propose a novel AE-based learning method named\nattention-infused autoencoder network (AiANet), which can parallelly and\nadaptively extract channel-wise and spatial features of CSI with an attention\nfusion mechanism. In addition, a locally-aware self-attention mechanism is\ndeveloped to extract both global and local spatial patterns, to better capture\nthe unique CSI features of different scenarios. Moreover, a mixed-training\nscheme is introduced to enable the proposed AiANet to gain generalizability\nacross indoor and outdoor scenarios. Results show that when trained and tested\nin the same scenario, AiANet can substantially outperform the existing AE-based\nmethods such as ACRNet, with an improvement of up to 3.42 dB in terms of\nnormalized mean squared error (NMSE). With the mixed-training scheme, AiANet\nexhibits superior cross-scenario generalizability compared to the benchmark\nmethods which are trained in one scenario and misused in another."}

This study addresses these gaps by\nendogenously incorporating local economic metrics into a power system planning\nmodel to evaluate how economic impacts influence solar siting, accounting for\nthe cost of lost agricultural output. We analyze all counties within the Great\nLakes region, constructing localized supply and marginal benefit curves that\nare embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at\nminimizing system costs and maximizing community economic benefits. Our\nfindings show that counties with larger economies and lower farmland\nproductivity deliver the highest local economic benefit per megawatt (MW) of\ninstalled solar capacity. In Ohio, for example, large counties generate up to\n$34,500 per MW, driven in part by high property tax revenues, while smaller\ncounties yield 31% less. Accounting for the opportunity cost of displaced\nagricultural output reduces local benefits by up to 16%, depending on farmland\nquality. A scenario prioritizing solar investment in counties with higher\neconomic returns increases total economic benefits by $1 billion (or 11%) by\n2040, with solar investment shifting away from Michigan and Wisconsin (down by\n39%) toward Ohio and Indiana (up by 75%), with only a marginal increase of 0.5%\nin system-wide costs.
