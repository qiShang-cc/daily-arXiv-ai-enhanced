While advanced energy-saving\nsystems exist, they often fall short without user engagement. Providing\nfeedback on energy consumption behavior is key to promoting sustainable\npractices. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a promising solution by\ndisaggregating total household energy usage, recorded by a central smart meter,\ninto appliance-level data. This empowers users to optimize consumption.\nAdvances in AI, IoT, and smart meter adoption have further enhanced NILM's\npotential.\n  Despite this promise, real-world NILM deployment faces major challenges.\nFirst, existing datasets mainly represent regions like the USA and UK, leaving\nplaces like the Mediterranean underrepresented. This limits understanding of\nregional consumption patterns, such as heavy use of air conditioners and\nelectric water heaters. Second, deep learning models used in NILM require high\ncomputational power, often relying on cloud services. This increases costs,\nraises privacy concerns, and limits scalability, especially for households with\npoor connectivity. This thesis tackles these issues with key contributions. It\npresents an interoperable data collection framework and introduces the Plegma\nDataset, focused on underrepresented Mediterranean energy patterns. It also\nexplores advanced deep neural networks and model compression techniques for\nefficient edge deployment. By bridging theoretical advances with practical\nneeds, this work aims to make NILM scalable, efficient, and adaptable for\nglobal energy sustainability."}

This work proposes an identity-independent\naudio deepfake detection framework that mitigates identity leakage by\nencouraging the model to focus on forgery-specific artifacts instead of\noverfitting to speaker traits. Our approach leverages Artifact Detection\nModules (ADMs) to isolate synthetic artifacts in both time and frequency\ndomains, enhancing cross-dataset generalization.
