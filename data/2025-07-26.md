### [1] [Time and Frequency Synchronization for Multiuser OTFS in Uplink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17966)
*Mohsen Bayat,Sanoopkumar P. S.,Arman Farhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于高移动场景下多用户OTFS系统的时间和频率同步技术，重点解决了定时偏移(TO)和载波频率偏移(CFO)的估计与校正问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高移动环境中，准确估计和校正TO和CFO对于多用户OTFS系统的性能至关重要，特别是在定位用户导频和提升信道估计精度方面。

Method: 提出了两种TO估计技术：一种基于单用户启发的PCP导频结构，另一种利用共享导频区域的MU-PCP模式。随后，通过Chebyshev多项式一维搜索方法解决多用户CFO估计问题。

Result: 所提技术能够有效估计和校正TO与CFO，提高了多用户OTFS系统在高移动场景下的同步精度。

Conclusion: 论文提出的同步技术显著提升了多用户OTFS系统在高移动环境中的性能，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose time and frequency synchronization techniques for
uplink multiuser OTFS (MU-OTFS) systems in high-mobility scenarios. This work
focuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and
carrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for
locating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances
channel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an
existing multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot
(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix
(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs
different Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via
correlation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a
correlation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot
structure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is
proposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the
delay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO
estimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'
signals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical
threshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major
peak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest
peak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the
proposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique
reduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into
multiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the
Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to
effectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO
estimates for all the users.

### [2] [Metasurface-based Fluid Antennas: from Electromagnetics to Communications Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17982)
*Pablo Ramírez-Espinosa,Cleofás Segura-Gómez,Ángel Palomares-Caballero,F. Javier López-Martínez,David Morales-Jiménez*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于动态超表面天线（DMA）的流体天线系统（FAS）的完整解析模型，解决了电子可重构天线在分析建模上的挑战，并通过全波仿真验证了模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子可重构天线虽然在实现FAS方面具有潜力，但其分析建模复杂，通常依赖全波仿真或测量，限制了理论指导和系统设计的可能性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 作者利用电路理论重新构建了FAS的信号模型，通过导纳矩阵考虑了超表面的电磁效应，并基于动态超表面天线（DMA）实现了FAS。

Conclusion: 本文提出的解析模型为FAS的设计和性能分析提供了理论支持，证明了DMA作为FAS实现的可行性及其接近理想化性能的能力。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) have become a popular topic in the wireless
community as an effective yet simple means of exploiting spatial diversity. Due
to the limitations of physically moving radiating elements, electronically
reconfigurable antennas are emerging as practical implementations of FASs,
since changing the radiation pattern is functionally equivalent to physically
moving the device. However, electronically reconfigurable antennas pose a
challenge in terms of analytical modeling, often requiring full-wave
simulations or measurements for their characterization; this severely limits
the extraction of theoretical insights useful for system design. Motivated by
these difficulties and the growing interest in FASs, we propose in this paper a
complete analytical model for metasurface-based embodiments of FASs.
Specifically, we advocate for the implementation of the FAS concept through
dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), hitherto proposed as array replacements in
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We leverage circuit theory to
rewrite the conventional signal model of FASs in terms of admittance matrices
accounting for the electromagnetic effects inherent to metasurfaces. The model
is validated with full-wave simulations, showing good agreement. We further
illustrate how to apply the model for standard performance analysis, and
provide closed-form expressions for key metrics, including the resulting signal
covariance matrix. Results confirm that practical DMA-based FASs can achieve
similar performance to that of idealized implementations of position-flexible
antennas.

### [3] [Multiple Active STAR-RIS-Assisted Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication via Cooperative Beamforming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18035)
*Hyeonho Noh,Hyeonsu Lyu,Hyun Jong Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了由多个主动同时传输和反射的可重构智能表面（STAR-RIS）支持的集成感知与通信（ISAC）网络，通过联合优化基站发射波束和STAR-RIS系数，在满足感知、安全和功率约束下最大化通信总和速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索主动STAR-RIS在ISAC网络中的应用，解决传统被动RIS和单一STAR-RIS的性能限制，同时满足高要求的多目标优化问题。

Method: 采用交替优化（AO）框架，将非凸优化问题分解为子问题，通过KKT条件和连续凸逼近（SCA）分别优化基站波束和STAR-RIS系数。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提算法显著提升了总和速率，同时严格满足感知和保密性约束，优于被动RIS和单一STAR-RIS基准。

Conclusion: 主动STAR-RIS和AO框架的有效结合为ISAC网络提供了高性能的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network
empowered by multiple active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). A base station (BS) furnishes
downlink communication to multiple users while concurrently interrogating a
sensing target. We jointly optimize the BS transmit beamformer and the
reflection/transmission coefficients of every active STAR-RIS in order to
maximize the aggregate communication sum-rate, subject to (i) a stringent
sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement, (ii) an
upper bound on the leakage of confidential information, and (iii) individual
hardware and total power constraints at both the BS and the STAR-RISs. The
resulting highly non-convex program is tackled with an efficient alternating
optimization (AO) framework. First, the original formulation is reformulated
into an equivalent yet more tractable representation and partitioned into
subproblems. The BS beamformer is updated in closed form via the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, whereas the STAR-RIS reflection and
transmission vectors are refined through successive convex approximation (SCA),
yielding a semidefinite program that is then solved via semidefinite
relaxation. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
delivers substantial sum-rate gains over passive-RIS and single STAR-RIS
baselines, all the while rigorously meeting the prescribed sensing and security
constraints.

### [4] [Geometrical portrait of Multipath error propagation in GNSS Direct Position Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18096)
*Jihong Huang,Rong Yang,Wei Gao,Xingqun Zhan,Zheng Yao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了卫星圆形多径偏差（SCMB）模型，用于量化多径误差对GNSS信号CAF和PVT解的影响，并通过蒙特卡洛模拟和城市峡谷测试验证了其正确性。研究发现PVT偏差随卫星仰角增加而增加，强调了选择高、低仰角卫星组合的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补直接位置估计（DPE）理论中多径误差的理论空白，特别是在城市环境中增强GNSS接收器的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过几何分析扩展DPE噪声方差的理论框架，引入SCMB模型量化多径误差，并结合蒙特卡洛模拟和实际测试验证模型。

Result: PVT最大偏差取决于各卫星通道中的最大多径误差，且偏差随卫星仰角增加而增加。这为从几何角度选择DPE卫星提供了依据。

Conclusion: 研究为优化GNSS接收器在多径环境中的性能提供了理论支持，强调了卫星几何配置对减少PVT偏差的重要性。

Abstract: Direct Position Estimation (DPE) is a method that directly estimate position,
velocity, and time (PVT) information from cross ambiguity function (CAF) of the
GNSS signals, significantly enhancing receiver robustness in urban
environments. However, there is still a lack of theoretical characterization on
multipath errors in the context of DPE theory. Geometric observations highlight
the unique characteristics of DPE errors stemming from multipath and thermal
noise as estimation bias and variance respectively. Expanding upon the
theoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this
paper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying
the deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative
to the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)
model is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite
channels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established
through discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness
of the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo
simulations and urban canyon tests. The findings indicate that the maximum PVT
bias depends on the largest multipath errors observed across various satellite
channels. Additionally, the PVT bias increases with satellite elevation angles,
influenced by the CAF multipath bias projection. This serves as a reference for
selecting DPE satellites from a geometric standpoint, underscoring the
importance of choosing a balanced combination of high and low elevation angles
to achieve an optimal satellite geometry configuration.

### [5] [Envelope Control Enabled Probabilistic Shaping for Peak Power Constrained IM DD Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18149)
*Dongdong Zou,Wei Wang,Jiawen Yao,Zhongxing Tian,Zeyu Feng,Huan Huang,Fan Li,Gordon Ning Liu,Gangxiang Shen,Yi Cai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对峰值功率受限IM-DD系统的间接概率成形方案，通过动态选择性映射和改良的M-BCJR算法，显著提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对IM-DD系统中概率成形技术的应用受限问题，尤其在存在记忆效应时，研究如何优化信号控制以减少负面影响。

Method: 提出动态选择性映射(DSLM)机制和改良的M-BCJR算法，实现信号和比特的联合优化处理。

Result: 在56GBaud PAM8系统中，实现了1dB的接收灵敏度提升，并与典型概率振幅成形架构兼容。

Conclusion: 为峰值功率受限IM-DD系统中概率成形技术的应用提供了新思路和解决方案。

Abstract: Probabilistic shaping (PS) has attracted significant attention in
intensity-modulation and direct-detection (IM-DD) systems. However, due to the
unique system model and inherent constraints, the effective application of the
PS technique is still an open question in IM-DD systems, particularly in
systems with memory effects. In this paper, a novel indirect PS scheme tailored
for peak power constrained (PPC) IM-DD systems is proposed. The key idea lies
in strategically controlling the signal envelope to mitigate memory-induced
impairments, such as nonlinearity, overshoot, peak-to-average power ratio
enhancement, etc. The proposed scheme incorporates a dynamic selective mapping
(DSLM) mechanism at the transmitter, enabling an untypical bit-to-symbol
mapping in which the current symbol is not only determined by the current bits
pattern but also by previously generated symbols within a specified memory
length. At the receiver side, a turbo equalizer with a modified M-BCJR
algorithm is proposed to achieve the recovery of ambiguous bits induced by
DSLM. Experimental verification in a 56GBaud PAM8 system demonstrates that the
proposed scheme exhibits 1dB receiver sensitivity improvement over 2km
single-mode fiber transmission. In addition, the proposed scheme has also been
demonstrated to be compatible with the typical probabilistic amplitude shaping
architecture, enabling a simple and fine-granularity rate adaptation
capability. To the best of our knowledge, this work opens a new sight for the
application of the PS technique in PPC IM-DD systems with memory effects.

### [6] [GNSS Jammer and Spoofer Mitigation via Multi-Antenna Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18166)
*Jonas Elmiger,Gian Marti,Christoph Studer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SCHIEBER 是一种多天线 GNSS 接收器方法，无需先验知识即可有效抑制干扰和欺骗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS 信号易受干扰和欺骗攻击，影响定位可靠性。

Method: 使用自适应空间滤波抑制干扰，通过一致性测试（DoA 和伪距）识别欺骗信号。

Result: 仿真验证了其在 GPS L1 C/A 系统下对抗干扰和欺骗的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为 GNSS 安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern positioning relies on radio signals from global navigation satellite
systems (GNSS). Their low receive power renders these radio signals susceptible
to jamming attacks, in which malicious transmitters emit strong interference to
disrupt signal acquisition. Moreover, GNSS are vulnerable to spoofing attacks,
in which malicious transmitters mimic legitimate satellites by transmitting
spurious GNSS signals. We propose SCHIEBER, a novel method for multi-antenna
GNSS receivers that mitigates jammers as well as spoofers without requiring any
prior knowledge of the receiver position or attack type: Jammers are mitigated
during signal acquisition using a recently developed adaptive spatial filtering
technique. Spoofers are identified and rejected after signal acquisition using
a novel approach that tests the consistency of acquired signals by comparing
their respective direction of arrival (DoA) and pseudorange estimates in a test
that is invariant with respect to the unknown receiver position. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our method using extensive simulations of a GPS L1 C/A system
under spoofing and jamming attacks.

### [7] [ICWLM: A Multi-Task Wireless Large Model via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18167)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的无线原生基础模型ICWLM，通过上下文学习解决多任务学习问题，显著提升了泛化能力和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信技术快速发展带来了网络复杂性和计算需求，深度学习虽被广泛研究，但仍面临任务特定性和数据稀缺问题。

Method: ICWLM直接在大规模混合无线数据集上训练，联合解决多用户预编码和信道预测等物理层问题，采用DWA算法动态平衡多任务损失。

Result: 仿真结果表明，ICWLM在性能上与任务特定方法相当，且对未见过系统配置展现出显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: ICWLM为未来无线网络提供了一种统一且自适应的AI模型范式，有望降低部署复杂性和提升资源管理智能。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies, particularly
massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave),
introduces significant network complexity and computational demands.
Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer
performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are
usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model
(ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous
multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that
adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is
trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It
jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user
precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A
key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL),
enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel
conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive
retraining. Furthermore, we employ the Dynamic Weight Averaging (DWA) algorithm
to dynamically balance the individual task losses during multi-task training,
ensuring efficient and stable learning across diverse objectives. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance
compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization
capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising
paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless
networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent
resource management.

### [8] [Quantized Signal Recovery with Interference via Parametrized Look-Up Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18370)
*Morriel Kasher,Michael Tinston,Predrag Spasojevic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出通过参数化查找表（LUT）优化低分辨率模数转换器的数字后校正，评估了三种分析估计器，并提出了针对相位调制信号和线性调频干扰信号的近似方法，仿真验证了高精度实时信号恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低分辨率、非线性或宽带量化器的性能优化需求，尤其是在高功率带外干扰下恢复瞬时信号的挑战。

Method: 使用参数化LUT结合三种分析估计器，提出针对相位调制和线性调频干扰的近似方法。

Result: 仿真表明方法能高精度实时恢复信号，显著优于传统线性滤波技术，对3位量化音调输入，MSE改善>10 dB，SFDR改善>20 dBc。

Conclusion: 参数化LUT加优化估计器能有效提升低分辨率ADC性能，适应非线性和时变干扰。

Abstract: Efficient all-digital post-correction of low-resolution analog-to-digital
converters can be achieved by using Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The performance of a
LUT can be optimized by incorporating a parametric model for the expected input
signal, noise level, and interference signals. We evaluate three analytical
estimators for integration with parametrized LUTs, especially with applications
to low-resolution, non-linear, or wideband quantizers. We also propose several
approximations to improve tractability of the estimation problem for
Phase-Shift Keyed input signals and Linear Frequency Modulated interference
signals. Simulated results validate the ability of our estimator to recover the
instantaneous value of the desired input signal in real-time with a high degree
of accuracy. This includes cancellation of harmonic distortion that aliases
into the desired signal bandwidth from front-end saturation due to high-power
out-of-band interference. Our estimators are shown to achieve a significant
gain over conventional linear-filtering techniques while also being robust to
changes in input parameters, non-linear quantizers, and time-variant
interference sources. For a tone input quantized to 3 bits and estimated with a
fixed 12-tap model order we achieve $>$10 dB improvement in Mean Square Error
and $>$20 dBc improvement in Spurious-Free Dynamic Range.

### [9] [A Foundation Model for Massive MIMO Precoding with an Adaptive per-User Rate-Power Tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18587)
*Jérôme Emery,Ali Hasanzadeh Karkan,Jean-François Frigon,François Leduc-Primeau*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的基础模型用于mMIMO预编码，减少能量消耗并动态适应用户速率需求，数据稀缺时通过数据增强方法提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决mMIMO系统中深度学习模型因数据稀缺和训练复杂度高而难以实际部署的问题。

Method: 使用Transformer基础模型进行预编码，引入数据增强方法通过余弦相似度找到与目标分布相似的训练样本。

Result: 零样本部署时，模型在相同能量消耗下显著优于零强制方法，接近WMMSE性能且复杂度低8倍。

Conclusion: 该工作通过解决数据可用性和训练复杂度的挑战，实现了DL解决方案在实际中的部署，并为资源分配算法提供了更灵活的控制。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

### [10] [Deep Learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation for Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17950)
*Jiajia Guo,Chao-Kai Wen,Xiao Li,Shi Jin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的位置域信道外推框架PCEnet，用于无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统，显著降低信道获取的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少信道获取的开销，并利用用户位置信息提升信道获取效率，尤其是在无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统中。

Method: 利用神经网络从获取的信道推断用户位置，并通过位置信息辅助其他信道估计与重建；同时提出简化策略和无需位置标签的方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明PCEnet框架能够将导频和反馈开销降低高达50%。

Conclusion: PCEnet框架通过位置信息实现了高效的信道获取，并提供了多种优化方案以降低复杂度和延迟。

Abstract: To reduce channel acquisition overhead, spatial, time, and frequency-domain
channel extrapolation techniques have been widely studied. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation
framework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel
characteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel
acquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments
between different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective
channels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique
across all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages
the position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the
characteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to
assist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach
first utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the
obtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central
processing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and
concatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to
reconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition
performance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the
estimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the
pilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position
label-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the
absolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during
the localization NN training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
PCEnet framework reduces pilot and feedback overheads by up to 50%.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于MEC的网络化ISAC系统中低空经济(LAE)的隐蔽传输设计，优化了通信、感知和计算资源以及无人机轨迹，提出了一种交替优化算法，并通过仿真验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空经济(LAE)依赖于ISAC、MEC和隐蔽通信，如何在这些系统中实现高效、隐蔽的传输是其核心挑战。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过推导检测误差概率(DEP)的闭式表达式，提出了一种交替优化算法，分为资源优化和轨迹优化两个子问题，分别采用逐次凸逼近和信任域方法解决。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提算法优于多种基准方法，并揭示了LAE系统中通信、感知与计算之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 本文为LAE系统中的隐蔽传输提供了高效的设计方案，通过资源与轨迹联合优化，实现了能耗最小化和系统性能的提升。

Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) is an emerging business model, which heavily
relies on integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), mobile edge computing
(MEC), and covert communications. This paper investigates the convert
transmission design in MEC-based networked ISAC systems towards LAE, where an
MEC server coordinates multiple access points to simultaneously receive
computation tasks from multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), locate a
target in a sensing area, and maintain UAVs' covert transmission against
multiple wardens. We first derive closed-form expressions for the detection
error probability (DEP) at wardens. Then, we formulate a total energy
consumption minimization problem by optimizing communication, sensing, and
computation resources as well as UAV trajectories, subject to the requirements
on quality of MEC services, DEP, and radar signal-to-interference-and-noise
ratio, and the causality of UAV trajectories. An alternating optimization based
algorithm is proposed to handle the considered problem, which decomposes it
into two subproblems: joint optimization of communication, sensing, and
computation resources, and UAV trajectory optimization. The former is addressed
by a successive convex approximation based algorithm, while the latter is
solved via a trust-region based algorithm. Simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with various benchmarks, and
reveal the trade-offs among communication, sensing, and computation in LAE
systems.

Result: 实验表明Transformer在ECG划界的半监督任务中优于卷积网络。

Conclusion: 该基准为半监督ECG划界方法的发展奠定了基础，并有望推动该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

TL;DR: 提出一种模块化的非线性最小二乘滤波方法，用于独立子系统组成的系统，避免信息重复计算。

Method: 采用协方差交集（CI）算法，并通过最小二乘估计推导实现。

Result: 在机器人-地标定位问题中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 模块化方法在性能和通信带宽需求之间取得了平衡。

Abstract: In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach
for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance
estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative
measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We
integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in
order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates
with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least
squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the
proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem,
noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position
measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation
problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized
simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic
joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we
also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful
degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth
requirements.

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for material characterization. However,
careful preprocessing is required for the identification and handling of noise,
baseline drift, and random spikes. This paper presents a comprehensive approach
to generating and preprocessing Raman spectra. Additionally, we describe
methods for fitting Voigt peaks to the spectrum to determine peak parameters.
The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated using both synthetic and
real Raman spectra, with code provided in an open-source GitHub repository.
