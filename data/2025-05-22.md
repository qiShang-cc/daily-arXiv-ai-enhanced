### [1] [SINR Maximizing Distributionally Robust Adaptive Beamforming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15493)
*Kiarash Hassas Irani,Yongwei Huang,Sergiy A. Vorobyov*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文通过最坏情况下信号干扰噪声比（SINR）的最大化，解决了基于分布不确定集的鲁棒自适应波束成形问题，提出了针对干扰加噪声协方差矩阵和期望信号导向向量的不同不确定性集，并通过迭代算法实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统自适应波束成形技术在面对干扰加噪声协方差矩阵和期望信号导向向量不确定性时的性能下降问题，论文提出了一种基于分布不确定性集的鲁棒方法。

Method: 作者设计了两种干扰加噪声协方差矩阵的不确定性集和三种导向向量的不确定性集。通过线性锥规划的对偶性，将问题转化为二次矩阵不等式问题，并采用迭代算法求解一系列线性矩阵不等式松弛问题。

Result: 仿真实验表明，所提出的鲁棒波束成形方法在阵列输出SINR方面表现出优于传统方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为鲁棒自适应波束成形问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，特别是在面对分布不确定性时表现出更高的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) problem via the
worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) maximization over
distributional uncertainty sets for the random interference-plus-noise
covariance (INC) matrix and desired signal steering vector. Our study explores
two distinct uncertainty sets for the INC matrix and three for the steering
vector. The uncertainty sets of the INC matrix account for the support and the
positive semidefinite (PSD) mean of the distribution, as well as a similarity
constraint on the mean. The uncertainty sets for the steering vector consist of
the constraints on the first- and second-order moments of its associated
probability distribution. The RAB problem is formulated as the minimization of
the worst-case expected value of the SINR denominator over any distribution
within the uncertainty set of the INC matrix, subject to the condition that the
expected value of the numerator is greater than or equal to one for every
distribution within the uncertainty set of the steering vector. By leveraging
the strong duality of linear conic programming, this RAB problem is
reformulated as a quadratic matrix inequality problem. Subsequently, it is
addressed by iteratively solving a sequence of linear matrix inequality
relaxation problems, incorporating a penalty term for the rank-one PSD matrix
constraint. We further analyze the convergence of the iterative algorithm. The
proposed robust beamforming approach is validated through simulation examples,
which illustrate improved performance in terms of the array output SINR.

### [2] [Exploiting Age of Information in Network Digital Twins for AI-driven Real-Time Link Blockage Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15519)
*Michele Zhu,Francesco Linsalata,Silvia Mura,Lorenzo Cazzella,Damiano Badini,Umberto Spagnolini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 通过引入信息新鲜度（AoI）指标优化网络数字孪生技术，结合射线追踪和深度学习，实现动态无线环境下高效的视距（LoS）识别，显著提升计算效率和模型适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频率通信链路易受遮挡影响，需通过技术手段实时准确识别视距（LoS），以确保通信可靠性。

Method: 结合射线追踪技术自动化采集和标注信道数据，引入AoI指标与损失函数结合，优先利用最新数据微调深度学习模型。

Result: 在仿真实验中，所提方法在4x8分辨率缩减下实现32倍计算加速，同时仅需1%数据即可有效缓解模型性能退化。

Conclusion: 该方法通过AoI优化网络数字孪生，显著提升LoS识别效率和模型鲁棒性，适合动态无线环境。

Abstract: The Line-of-Sight (LoS) identification is crucial to ensure reliable
high-frequency communication links, especially those vulnerable to blockages.
Network Digital Twins and Artificial Intelligence are key technologies enabling
blockage detection (LoS identification) for high-frequency wireless systems,
e.g., 6>GHz. In this work, we enhance Network Digital Twins by incorporating
Age of Information (AoI) metrics, a quantification of status update freshness,
enabling reliable real-time blockage detection (LoS identification) in dynamic
wireless environments. By integrating raytracing techniques, we automate
large-scale collection and labeling of channel data, specifically tailored to
the evolving conditions of the environment. The introduced AoI is integrated
with the loss function to prioritize more recent information to fine-tune deep
learning models in case of performance degradation (model drift). The
effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated in realistic urban
simulations, highlighting the trade-off between input resolution, computational
cost, and model performance. A resolution reduction of 4x8 from an original
channel sample size of (32, 1024) along the angle and subcarrier dimension
results in a computational speedup of 32 times. The proposed fine-tuning
successfully mitigates performance degradation while requiring only 1% of the
available data samples, enabling automated and fast mitigation of model drifts.

### [3] [Robust Activity Detection for Massive Random Access](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15555)
*Xinjue Wang,Esa Ollila,Sergiy A. Vorobyov*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对非高斯噪声环境的鲁棒设备活动检测方法，解决了传统方法在重尾脉冲噪声下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模机器通信（mMTC）在物联网中至关重要，但传统基于高斯噪声的设备活动检测方法在非高斯噪声下性能不佳。

Method: 提出使用鲁棒损失函数替代高斯损失函数，设计了固定点算法和两种鲁棒算法（RCWO和RCL-MP）。

Result: 数值实验表明，新方法在非高斯噪声下显著优于现有算法，检测准确性和鲁棒性更高。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来无线网络中的设备活动检测提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) are fundamental to the Internet of
Things (IoT) framework in future wireless networks, involving the connection of
a vast number of devices with sporadic transmission patterns. Traditional
device activity detection (AD) methods are typically developed for Gaussian
noise, but their performance may deteriorate when these conditions are not met,
particularly in the presence of heavy-tailed impulsive noise. In this paper, we
propose robust statistical techniques for AD that do not rely on the Gaussian
assumption and replace the Gaussian loss function with robust loss functions
that can effectively mitigate the impact of heavy-tailed noise and outliers.
First, we prove that the coordinate-wise (conditional) objective function is
geodesically convex and derive a fixed-point (FP) algorithm for minimizing it,
along with convergence guarantees. Building on the FP algorithm, we propose two
robust algorithms for solving the full (unconditional) objective function: a
coordinate-wise optimization algorithm (RCWO) and a greedy covariance
learning-based matching pursuit algorithm (RCL-MP). Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform existing
algorithms in scenarios with non-Gaussian noise, achieving higher detection
accuracy and robustness.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段生成AI框架，用于低空经济网络的时频谱制图，显著提升了重建精度和传感器部署效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空经济网络中，多样化的空中设备依赖无线通信技术，但面临频谱拥堵和环境干扰等挑战，传统方法难以处理其时空复杂性。

Method: 框架分两阶段：1）使用双掩码机制的重构掩码自动编码器（RecMAE）从稀疏时变数据重建频谱图；2）采用多智能体扩散策略（MADP）优化无人机传感器轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，该框架比传统插值方法和深度学习基线分别减少57.35%和88.68%的重建误差，显著提升了频谱图精度和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过生成AI技术有效解决了低空网络的频谱制图问题，为动态环境中的传感器部署和频谱管理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a two-stage generative AI (GenAI) framework tailored
for temporal spectrum cartography in low-altitude economy networks (LAENets).
LAENets, characterized by diverse aerial devices such as UAVs, rely heavily on
wireless communication technologies while facing challenges, including spectrum
congestion and dynamic environmental interference. Traditional spectrum
cartography methods have limitations in handling the temporal and spatial
complexities inherent to these networks. Addressing these challenges, the
proposed framework first employs a Reconstructive Masked Autoencoder (RecMAE)
capable of accurately reconstructing spectrum maps from sparse and temporally
varying sensor data using a novel dual-mask mechanism. This approach
significantly enhances the precision of reconstructed radio frequency (RF)
power maps. In the second stage, the Multi-agent Diffusion Policy (MADP) method
integrates diffusion-based reinforcement learning to optimize the trajectories
of dynamic UAV sensors. By leveraging temporal-attention encoding, this method
effectively manages spatial exploration and exploitation to minimize cumulative
reconstruction errors. Extensive numerical experiments validate that this
integrated GenAI framework outperforms traditional interpolation methods and
deep learning baselines by achieving 57.35% and 88.68% reconstruction error
reduction, respectively. The proposed trajectory planner substantially improves
spectrum map accuracy, reconstruction stability, and sensor deployment
efficiency in dynamically evolving low-altitude environments.

### [5] [Rate-Distortion Optimization with Non-Reference Metrics for UGC Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15003)
*Samuel Fernández-Menduiña,Xin Xiong,Eduardo Pavez,Antonio Ortega,Neil Birkbeck,Balu Adsumilli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于非参考指标的线性化方法，通过量化误差与梯度对齐来实现块级比特分配，避免了传统的迭代流程，显著提升了编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户生成内容（UGC）质量参差不齐，传统基于全参考指标（FRM）的编码方法在低质量输入时表现不佳，而非参考指标（NRM）虽适用但计算成本高。

Method: 线性化NRM并结合SSE正则化，推导出正则化参数和拉格朗日表达式，实现高效的块级比特分配。

Result: 实验表明，与SSE-RDO相比，该方法节省了30%以上的比特率，且解码器复杂度不变，编码器复杂度增加极小。

Conclusion: 该方法为UGC视频编码提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，显著提升了压缩效率。

Abstract: Service providers must encode a large volume of noisy videos to meet the
demand for user-generated content (UGC) in online video-sharing platforms.
However, low-quality UGC challenges conventional codecs based on
rate-distortion optimization (RDO) with full-reference metrics (FRMs). While
effective for pristine videos, FRMs drive codecs to preserve artifacts when the
input is degraded, resulting in suboptimal compression. A more suitable
approach used to assess UGC quality is based on non-reference metrics (NRMs).
However, RDO with NRMs as a measure of distortion requires an iterative
workflow of encoding, decoding, and metric evaluation, which is computationally
impractical. This paper overcomes this limitation by linearizing the NRM around
the uncompressed video. The resulting cost function enables block-wise bit
allocation in the transform domain by estimating the alignment of the
quantization error with the gradient of the NRM. To avoid large deviations from
the input, we add sum of squared errors (SSE) regularization. We derive
expressions for both the SSE regularization parameter and the Lagrangian, akin
to the relationship used for SSE-RDO. Experiments with images and videos show
bitrate savings of more than 30\% over SSE-RDO using the target NRM, with no
decoder complexity overhead and minimal encoder complexity increase.

### [6] [Movable Antenna Aided Full-Duplex ISAC System with Self-Interference Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14830)
*Size Peng,Yin Xu,Guanli Yi,Cixiao Zhang,Dazhi He,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用可移动天线（MA）提升集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统性能的方法，通过优化天线位置、波束形成和功率分配，显著提升了系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高ISAC系统中通信和感知的综合性能，传统的固定天线设计存在局限性，可移动天线因其灵活性提供了新的优化空间。

Method: 采用分数规划（FP）和交替优化（AO）算法联合优化波束形成、功率分配和天线位置，并结合粒子群优化（PSO）算法探索最优天线位置。

Result: 数值结果表明，MA系统在复杂ISAC场景中实现了精确波束形成，显著提升了自干扰消除能力和系统整体性能。

Conclusion: 可移动天线设计在ISAC系统中具有显著优势，相较于传统固定天线设计，能够更有效地提升系统性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has shown significant potential for improving the
performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this
paper, we model an MA-aided ISAC system operating in a communication
full-duplex mono-static sensing framework. The self-interference channel is
modeled as a function of the antenna position vectors under the near-field
channel condition. We develop an optimization problem to maximize the weighted
sum of downlink and uplink communication rates alongside the mutual information
relevant to the sensing task. To address this highly non-convex problem, we
employ the fractional programming (FP) method and propose an alternating
optimization (AO)-based algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming, user
power allocation, and antenna positions at the transceivers. Given the
sensitivity of the AO-based algorithm to the initial antenna positions, a
PSO-based algorithm is proposed to explore superior sub-optimal antenna
positions within the feasible region. Numerical results indicate that the
proposed algorithms enable the MA system to effectively leverage the antenna
position flexibility for accurate beamforming in a complex ISAC scenario. This
enhances the system's self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities and
markedly improves its overall performance and reliability compared to
conventional fixed-position antenna designs.

### [7] [Energy-Efficient Design for Downlink Pinching-Antenna Systems with QoS Guarantee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14904)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于捏合天线的下行时分多址（TDMA）多用户系统中的能量效率（EE）最大化方法，通过优化天线位置、发射功率和时间分配实现高EE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 通过分解问题为天线位置优化和功率/时间分配子问题，并采用迭代方法求解。功率和时间分配子问题分别通过半解析方法解决。

Result: 数值模拟显示，所提捏合天线策略在EE上显著优于固定天线系统和其他基准捏合天线方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为捏合天线系统的EE优化提供了有效解决方案，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Pinching antennas have recently garnered significant attention due to their
ability to dynamically reconfigure wireless propagation environments. Despite
notable advancements in this area, the exploration of energy efficiency (EE)
maximization in pinching-antenna systems remains relatively underdeveloped. In
this paper, we address the EE maximization problem in a downlink time-division
multiple access (TDMA)-based multi-user system employing one waveguide and
multiple pinching antennas, where each user is subject to a minimum rate
constraint to ensure quality-of-service. The formulated optimization problem
jointly considers transmit power and time allocations as well as the
positioning of pinching antennas, resulting in a non-convex problem. To tackle
this challenge, we first obtain the optimal positions of the pinching antennas.
Based on this, we establish a feasibility condition for the system.
Subsequently, the joint power and time allocation problem is decomposed into
two subproblems, which are solved iteratively until convergence. Specifically,
the power allocation subproblem is addressed through an iterative approach,
where a semi-analytical solution is obtained in each iteration. Likewise, a
semi-analytical solution is derived for the time allocation subproblem.
Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed pinching-antenna-based
strategy significantly outperforms both conventional fixed-antenna systems and
other benchmark pinching-antenna schemes in terms of EE.

*Jiangsheng Huangfu,Zhengyu Song,Tianwei Hou,Anna Li,Yuanwei Liu,Arumugam Nallanathan,Kai-Kit Wong*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了SISO模型在空间相关Rician衰落信道下的性能，推导了中断概率和遍历速率的表达式及界限，并分析了不同天线阵列配置对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索流体天线系统（FAS）在6G移动通信网络中的性能潜力，特别是在空间相关Rician衰落信道下的表现。

Method: 采用Rx-SISO-FAS模型，分析其中断概率和遍历速率，并通过均匀线性阵列（ULA）和均匀平面阵列（UPA）配置进行性能比较。

Result: 研究表明，增加端口数量会显著降低中断性能，FAS在Rician衰落信道下优于固定天线系统，且UPA性能优于ULA。

Conclusion: FAS在6G通信中具有显著性能优势，尤其是在多端口和UPA配置下，能够有效改善通信质量。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) are among the most promising technologies for the
sixth generation (6G) mobile communication networks. Unlike traditional
fixed-position multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, a FAS possesses
position reconfigurability to switch on-demand among $N$ predefined ports over
a prescribed space. This paper explores the performance of a single-input
single-output (SISO) model with a fixed-position antenna transmitter and a
single-antenna FAS receiver, referred to as the Rx-SISO-FAS model, under
spatially-correlated Rician fading channels. Our contributions include exact
expressions and closed-form bounds for the outage probability of the
Rx-SISO-FAS model, as well as exact and closed-form lower bounds for the
ergodic rate. Importantly, we also analyze the performance considering both
uniform linear array (ULA) and uniform planar array (UPA) configurations for
the ports of the FAS. To gain insights, we evaluate the diversity order of the
proposed model and our analytical results indicate that with a fixed overall
system size, increasing the number of ports, $N$, significantly decreases the
outage performance of FAS under different Rician fading factors. Our numerical
results further demonstrate that: $i)$ the Rx-SISO-FAS model can enhance
performance under spatially-correlated Rician fading channels over the
fixed-position antenna counterpart; $ii)$ the Rician factor negatively impacts
performance in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime; $iii$) FAS can
outperform an $L$ branches maximum ratio combining (MRC) system under Rician
fading channels; and $iv)$ when the number of ports is identical, UPA
outperforms ULA.

Method: 提出了一种适用于多RIS配置的低复杂度码本波束成形算法，减少对显式信道状态信息的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，多RIS系统比单RIS部署能提升14%的信道秩和吞吐量，同时保持低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 主动多RIS系统对下一代网络具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: While numerous experimental studies have demonstrated the feasibility of
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology, most have primarily
focused on extending coverage. In contrast, this paper presents an experimental
evaluation of multiple active RISs deployed in a 5G multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) commercial network, emphasizing enhancements in channel
rank and throughput. We propose a low-complexity, codebook-based beamforming
algorithm specifically tailored for multi-RIS configurations, which diversifies
directional channels and reduces reliance on explicit channel state
information. Field tests using a commercial base station and user equipment
reveal that the multi-RIS system can improve channel rank and throughput by up
to 14% compared to single-RIS deployments, while maintaining low computational
complexity. These findings underscore the practical benefits of active
multi-RIS systems for next-generation networks.

Abstract: Fiber nonlinearity represents a critical challenge to the capacity
enhancement of modern optical communication systems. In recent years,
significant research efforts have focused on mitigating its impact through two
complementary approaches. On the one hand, researchers have investigated
practical digital signal processing (DSP) techniques to mitigate or compensate
for nonlinear impairments, such as reversing fiber propagation effects through
digital backpropagation (DBP). However, the high computational complexity of
these techniques often discourages their practical implementation. On the other
hand, information-theoretic studies have sought to establish the capacity
limits of the nonlinear optical fiber channel, providing a framework for
evaluating the ultimate performance of existing optical networks and guiding
the design of next-generation systems. This work reviews recent advances and
proposes future directions for nonlinearity compensation and mitigation,
including constellation shaping techniques and low-complexity DBP. Furthermore,
it highlights the potential of these innovations both in advancing the
theoretical understanding of fiber capacity limits and in enabling practical
DSP implementations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个评估数据稀疏性对机器学习在电网故障检测和故障线路识别中影响的框架，结果显示模型在故障检测中表现稳健，但在故障线路识别中更为敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着德国向可再生能源转型，电网监测和控制的复杂性增加，机器学习在系统保护中的应用面临数据稀疏性的挑战，但其影响尚未系统验证。

Method: 通过模拟现实数据稀疏性场景，评估其对机器学习模型性能的影响，并在现有框架上验证评估策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为优化机器学习模型在实际电网保护中的应用提供了实用建议，提升了故障检测效率并指导了故障线路识别的改进。

Abstract: Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping
grid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage
decentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool
for power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault
line identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability
depends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor
failures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a
challenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically
validated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the
impact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate
realistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative
insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by
applying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model
remains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.000 even after
a 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance
decreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to
communication failures at critical network points. These findings offer
actionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection.
This enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies
within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective
deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations,
while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting
their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using
deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical
parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation.
Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity
data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same
domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be
trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern
propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.
