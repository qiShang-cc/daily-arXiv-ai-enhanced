This paper proposes an\nenvironmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the\ngenerative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location\nembedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS\nlocation information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the\ncross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to\nrespectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as\nthat among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target\nBSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM\ninference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.\nSpecifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free\nnetworks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM\nconstruction are prohibitively costly.

This is achieved through the\ninterconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave\nreconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at\none port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local\ncontrol of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further\nenhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,\nchannel reciprocity.

This paper introduces a novel application of\nNR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices\ncommunicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure\ntransmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses\nsignal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a\nphysics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural\nscattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,\nthe advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated.

Next, a task hypergraph is generated to associate the task\ninitiator with the physical attributes of the corresponding tasks. Based on\nthese two hypergraphs, a hypergraph matching algorithm is designed to\nfacilitate task-specific trusted collaborator selection and accurate\ntask-resource matching for value-maximizing task completion. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed TTR-matching framework\noutperforms comparison algorithms in identifying task-specific trustworthy\ncollaborators and maximizing the average value of task completion."}

This work\nanalyzes the impact of different anchor point positions on gait kinematics,\nmuscular activation and energetic consumption. A total of six experiments were\nconducted with 11 subjects wearing the XoSoft exosuit, which assists hip\nflexion in five configurations. Subjects were instrumented with an IMU-based\nmotion tracking system, EMG sensors, and a mask to measure metabolic\nconsumption. The results show that positioning the knee anchor point on the\nposterior side while keeping the hip anchor on the anterior part can reduce\nmuscle activation in the hip flexors by up to 10.21\\% and metabolic expenditure\nby up to 18.45\\%. Even if the only assisted joint was the hip, all the\nconfigurations introduced changes also in the knee and ankle kinematics.\nOverall, no single configuration was optimal across all subjects, suggesting\nthat a personalized approach is necessary to transmit the assistance forces\noptimally. These findings emphasize that anchor point position does indeed have\na significant impact on exoskeleton effectiveness and efficiency. However,\nthese optimal positions are subject-specific to the exosuit design, and there\nis a strong need for future work to tailor musculoskeletal models to individual\ncharacteristics and validate these results in clinical populations."}

To simultaneously support two groups of users energy\nreceivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time\nfrequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving\nERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A\nprotective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs\nto manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently,\nclosed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average\nsum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive\noptimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power\ncontrol, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term\nstatistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then\neffectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems,\nefficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the\nscattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep\nreinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power\ncontrol design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully\nconnected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the\nconventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in\nthe average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix\ndesign is employed."}
