From an energy\nperspective, the challenge is aggravated if devices rely on energy harvesting\n(EH), as energy availability can vary significantly over time, influencing the\naverage number of participating users in each iteration. Additionally, the\ntransmission of large model updates is more susceptible to interference from\nuncorrelated background traffic in shared wireless environments. As an\nalternative, federated distillation (FD) reduces communication overhead and\nenergy consumption by transmitting local model outputs, which are typically\nmuch smaller than the entire model used in FL. However, this comes at the cost\nof reduced model accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose FL-distillation\nalternation (FLDA). In FLDA, devices alternate between FD and FL phases,\nbalancing model information with lower communication overhead and energy\nconsumption per iteration. We consider a multichannel slotted-ALOHA EH-IoT\nnetwork subject to background traffic/interference. In such a scenario, FLDA\ndemonstrates higher model accuracy than both FL and FD, and achieves faster\nconvergence than FL. Moreover, FLDA achieves target accuracies saving up to 98%\nin energy consumption, while also being less sensitive to interference, both\nrelative to FL."}

To address this issue, we developed a non-invasive approach for\nautomated classification of iPSC-CM maturity through interpretable artificial\nintelligence (AI)-based analysis of beat characteristics derived from\nvideo-based motion analysis. In a prospective study, we evaluated 230 video\nrecordings of early-state, immature iPSC-CMs on day 21 after differentiation\n(d21) and more mature iPSC-CMs cultured in MM (d42, MM). For each recording, 10\nfeatures were extracted using Maia motion analysis software and entered into a\nsupport vector machine (SVM). The hyperparameters of the SVM were optimized in\na grid search on 80 % of the data using 5-fold cross-validation. The optimized\nmodel achieved an accuracy of 99.5 $\\pm$ 1.1 % on a hold-out test set. Shapley\nAdditive Explanations (SHAP) identified displacement, relaxation-rise time and\nbeating duration as the most relevant features for assessing maturity level.\nOur results suggest the use of non-invasive, optical motion analysis combined\nwith AI-based methods as a tool to assess iPSC-CMs maturity and could be\napplied before performing functional readouts or drug testing. This may\npotentially reduce the variability and improve the reproducibility of\nexperimental studies."}

However, as nearly\npassive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and\ninterference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even\naffect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be\ndegraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this\nfundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based\ndynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence,\nintegrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user\ntrajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS\ncontroller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to\nmaximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed TPC method over various system settings."}

Conventional systems are often inadequate due to\nunreliable infrastructure, power grid failures, high investment costs and\nscalability challenges. This paper explores the potential of ad-hoc mesh joint\nradar and communication (JRC) networks as a scalable, resilient,\nenergy-efficient solution for disaster management that can operate\nindependently of conventional infrastructure. The proposed JRC network enhances\ndisaster response by integrating target detection (such as identifying vital\nsigns, hazardous leaks, and fires) with communication capabilities to ensure\nefficient information dissemination under intense clutter conditions. Key\nperformance metrics, including data rate, Signal-to-Clutter and Noise Ratio\n(SCNR), probability of detection, and false alarm rate, are used to assess\nperformance. An optimization approach is proposed to provide an\nenergy-efficient resource allocation scheme. The results show the performance\nof ad-hoc mesh JRC systems, underscoring their potential to enhance disaster\nmanagement efforts by addressing unique operational challenges."}

While OSaaS\nfacilitates transparent connectivity and resource sharing among users, it\nraises concerns over potential network vulnerabilities due to shared fiber\naccess and inter-channel interference, such as fiber non-linearity and\namplifier based crosstalk. These challenges are exacerbated in multi-user\nenvironments, complicating the identification and localization of service\ninterferences. To reduce system disruptions and system repair costs, it is\nbeneficial to detect and identify such interferences timely. Addressing these\nchallenges, this paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) based architecture\nfor network operators to detect and attribute interferences to specific OSaaS\nusers while blind to the users' internal spectrum details. Our methodology\nleverages available coarse power measurements and operator channel performance\ndata, bypassing the need for internal user information of wide-band shared\nspectra. Experimental studies conducted on a 190 km optical line system in the\nOpen Ireland testbed, with three OSaaS users demonstrate the model's capability\nto accurately classify the source of interferences, achieving a classification\naccuracy of 90.3%."}

To address this, we propose Model as Loss, a\nnovel training paradigm that utilizes the encoder from the same model as a loss\nfunction to guide the training.\n  The Model as Loss paradigm leverages the encoder's task-specific feature\nspace, optimizing the decoder to produce output consistent with perceptual and\ntask-relevant characteristics of the clean signal.

This study\ninvestigates the potential of multistatic localization in Wi-Fi networks\nthrough the deployment of multiple cooperative antenna arrays. The\ncollaborative gain offered by these arrays is twofold: (i) intra-array coherent\ngain at the wavelength scale among antenna elements, and (ii) inter-array\ncooperative gain across arrays. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of\nthis approach, we develop WiCAL (Wi-Fi Collaborative Antenna Localization), a\nsystem built upon commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure equipped with uniform\nrectangular arrays. These arrays are driven by multiplexing embedded radio\nfrequency chains available in standard access points or user devices, thereby\neliminating the need for sophisticated, costly, and power-hungry\nmulti-transceiver modules typically required in multiple-input and\nmultiple-output systems. To address phase offsets introduced by RF chain\nmultiplexing, we propose a three-stage, fine-grained phase alignment scheme to\nsynchronize signals across antenna elements within each array. A bidirectional\nspatial smoothing MUSIC algorithm is employed to estimate angles of arrival\n(AoAs) and mitigate performance degradation caused by correlated interference.\nTo further exploit inter-array cooperative gain, we elaborate on the\nsynchronization mechanism among distributed URAs, which enables direct position\ndetermination by bypassing intermediate angle estimation. Once synchronized,\nthe distributed URAs effectively form a virtual large-scale array,\nsignificantly enhancing spatial resolution and localization accuracy."}
