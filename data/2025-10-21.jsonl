Specifically, we investigate a\nSTAR-RIS-assisted multi-user RSMA system and develop an intelligent\noptimization strategy that jointly designs the transmitter's active\nbeamforming, the common stream rate allocation, and the passive beamforming\nvectors for the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection regions, considering\ntransceiver hardware impairments and imperfect channel state information (CSI).\nIn addition, system robustness is ensured via a bounded channel estimation\nerror model that captures CSI imperfections and guarantees resilience against\nworst-case errors. To address the highly non-convex problem, we propose an\niterative optimization algorithm that decomposes it into two sub-problems.\nFirstly, active beamforming vectors for the common and private signals are\ndetermined by reformulating the original problem into a convex semi-definite\nprogramming (SDP) form using successive convex approximation (SCA) and\nsemi-definite relaxation (SDR). Secondly, passive beamforming vectors are\noptimized through a convex SDP reformulation by exploiting SCA and SDR\ntechniques. Moreover, when higher-rank solutions arise, Gaussian randomization\nis applied to obtain rank-one solutions.

Traditional approaches are typically\nconstrained by their reliance on domain-specific expertise to customize\nplanners, and often struggle with spatio-temporal couplings that usually lead\nto infeasible motions or discrepancies between task planning and motion\nexecution. Despite the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in\nhigh-level semantic reasoning, hallucination could result in infeasible motion\nplans. In this paper, we introduce the T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic\nmotion planning framework that self-corrects it output with formal methods. The\nframework decomposes spatio-temporal task constraints via three cascaded\nmodules, each of which stimulates an LLM to generate candidate trajectory\nsequences and examines their feasibility via a Signal Temporal Logic (STL)\nverifier until one that satisfies complex spatial, temporal, and logical\nconstraints is found.Experiments across different scenarios show that T3\nPlanner significantly outperforms the baselines. The required reasoning can be\ndistilled into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model that enables efficient deployment.\nAll supplementary materials are accessible at\nhttps://github.com/leeejia/T3_Planner."}

In this work, we\npropose a systematic DD pulse design framework for Zak-OTFS that expresses the\npulse as a linear combination of Hermite basis functions. We obtain the optimal\ncoefficients for the Hermite basis functions that minimize the inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI) energy at the DD sampling points by solving a constrained\noptimization problem via singular value decomposition. For the proposed class\nof Hermite pulses, we derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and\nnoise covariance in Zak-OTFS. Simulation results of Zak-OTFS with embedded\npilot and model-free I/O relation estimation in Vehicular-A channels with\nfractional DDs demonstrate that the optimized pulse shape achieves a bit error\nrate performance that is significantly superior compared to those of the\ncanonical sinc and Gaussian pulses and is on par with that of the\nstate-of-the-art GS pulse, validating the proposed framework which provides\ngreater design flexibility in terms of control of ISI and sidelobe energies."}

This work addresses the\nchallenge of descriptively identifying a unique \"signature\" (local point cloud)\nby leveraging a detectable, high-precision \"anchor\" (like a pole). To solve\nthis, we propose a novel canonical representation, \"Pole-Image,\" as a hybrid\nmethod that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding\n3D structure. Pole-Image represents a pole-like landmark and its surrounding\nenvironment, detected from a LiDAR point cloud, as a 2D polar coordinate image\nwith the pole itself as the origin. This representation leverages the pole's\nnature as a high-precision reference point, explicitly encoding the \"relative\ngeometry\" between the stable pole and the variable surrounding point cloud. The\nkey advantage of pole landmarks is that \"detection\" is extremely easy. This\nease of detection allows the robot to easily track the same pole, enabling the\nautomatic and large-scale collection of diverse observational data (positive\npairs).

In this work, we refer to System 2 as the\nembodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and\ndecision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation\nof the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution\nsuccess, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete\ndimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of\ncognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark\nthat systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as\nembodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation\npipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension,\nperception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure\nanalysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure\nrealism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects,\nand multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data.

An inverse optimal control\napproach was applied to identify the \"best\" objective function, among a\npositive linear combination of basis objective functions, associated with the\ngait of two post-stroke males, one high-functioning (subject S1) and one\nlow-functioning (subject S2). It was found that the \"best\" objective function\nis subject- and leg-specific. No single function works universally well, yet\nthe best options are usually differently weighted combinations of muscle\nactivation- and power-minimization. Subject-specific inverse optimal control\nmodels performed best on their respective limbs (\\textbf{RMSE 178/213 N, CC\n0.71/0.61} for non-paretic and paretic legs of S1; \\textbf{RMSE 205/165 N, CC\n0.88/0.85} for respective legs of S2), but cross-subject generalization was\npoor, particularly for paretic legs. Moreover, minimizing the root mean square\nof muscle power emerged as important for paretic limbs, while minimizing\nactivation-based functions dominated for non-paretic limbs. This may suggest\ndifferent neural control strategies between affected and unaffected sides,\npossibly altered by the presence of spasticity. Among the 15 considered\nobjective functions commonly used in inverse dynamics-based computations, the\nroot mean square of muscle power was the only one explicitly incorporating\nmuscle velocity, leading to a possible model for spasticity in the paretic\nlimbs. Although this objective function has been rarely used, it may be\nrelevant for modeling pathological gait, such as post-stroke gait."}

Safe reinforcement learning\nprovides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being\na popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially\ndepends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, which governs the\ntrade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update\nthe multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in\npractice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an\nautomated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we\nanalyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe\nreinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\\lambda$-profiles\nthat give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and\nconstraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly\nsensitive nature of $\\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general\nintuition for choosing the optimal value $\\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally\nshow that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even\nexceed the optimal performance found at $\\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference\nin their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier\nupdates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated\nthrough PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to\nachieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need\nfor further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement\nlearning.
