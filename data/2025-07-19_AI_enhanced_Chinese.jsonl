The channel when viewed in the DD domain is\npredictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically,\nalbeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication\nscheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot\ntransmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be\nused as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data\ncan enable further detection enabling the \"differential\" aspect of the\ncommunication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD\nchannel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data\nsymbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next\ninstant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it\nallows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would\notherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols.\nSecond, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded\npilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot\nscheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower\ncomplexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eZak-OTFS\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u9891\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5bfc\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Zak-OTFS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\uff08DD\uff09\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1DD\u57df\u4fe1\u9053\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4f20\u8f93\u5bfc\u9891\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e00\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5dee\u5206\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528DD\u57df\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5dee\u5206Zak-OTFS\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bfc\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be\ntime-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited\ncomputing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing\nresources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters.

In this paper, we propose design criteria to\ngenerate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that\nafter training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error\n(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network\nsolutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for\nreal-world implementations.

One objective of the proposed scheme is\nto optimize the PA locations, based on which an optimal design of the\nlegitimate signal beamforming and artificial noise covariance matrices is\nprovided to maximize the network's sensing performance, subject to secrecy and\ntotal power constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme\nthrough numerical examples and compare that against a traditional DFRC ISAC\nsystem with a uniform linear array of half-wavelength-spaced antennas. We show\nthat the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline PA-aided scheme with\nequidistant PAs by $3$ dB in terms of illumination power, while it can provide\ngains of up to $30$ dB of the same metric against a traditional ISAC system\nwith half-wavelength-space uniform linear arrays.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u634f\u5408\u5929\u7ebf\uff08PA\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ISAC\uff09\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316PA\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4fdd\u969c\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800cPA\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePA\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ecPA\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5408\u6cd5\u4fe1\u53f7\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7167\u660e\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfPA\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u5347\u4e863 dB\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u4e8630 dB\u3002", "conclusion": "PA\u8f85\u52a9\u7684ISAC\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4fdd\u969c\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}
