Recent advancements in deep\nlearning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques.\nHowever, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that\nnecessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered\ncomputing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless\nnetworks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for\ndistributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to\nperform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this\ninvestigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this\ndistributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying\nmodulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective\nof the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the\ncentralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate\nof 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around\n41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods\nexhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers,\nthe initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while\nsubstantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized\nmodel. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature\nmap, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies\na substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach.\nThese findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly\nenhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of\nbandwidth-limited wireless networks."}

In\nthe complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ\nparticle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the\nhidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle\nfiltering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of\nthe system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based\noptimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle\nfilters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several\nrecently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering\ndifferentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such\ndifferentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular\nPyTorch framework.

A closed-form, approximation-free control law\nis derived to ensure that each agent remains within its evolving STT, thereby\navoiding dynamic obstacles while also preventing inter-agent collisions in a\nsocially aware manner, and reaching the target within a prescribed time. The\nproposed approach provides formal guarantees on safety and timing, and is\ncomputationally lightweight, model-free, and robust to unknown disturbances.\nThe effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through\nsimulation and hardware experiments on a 2D omnidirectional"}

Yet when these VLMs\nare adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their\noriginal VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,\nshowing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual\nrepresentations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's\nhidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of\ntargeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart\nVLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We\nfurther evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and\nintroduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields\nimproved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,\nour analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the\ndegradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to\nrecover inherited VL capabilities.
