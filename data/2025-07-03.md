### [1] [Degrees of Freedom of Spatial Multiplexing in Distance Domain of Arbitrary Continuous-Aperture Array in Near-Field Region](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01227)
*Son T. Duong,Tho Le-Ngoc*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了近场大孔径阵列在空间复用中的最大自由度，发现其主要由阵列边界而非内部结构决定，并通过投影方法和模块化阵列扩展了分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨近场大孔径阵列在空间复用中的最大自由度，解决传统远场系统无法在相同角度方向同时服务多用户的限制。

Method: 使用连续孔径阵列模型，通过积分算子和傅里叶变换推导闭合表达式，并扩展到非正侧配置和模块化阵列。

Result: 空间自由度主要由阵列边界决定，模块化阵列在物理长度约束下能提供更高的自由度。

Conclusion: 近场阵列的空间复用自由度受边界影响显著，模块化设计可优化性能。

Abstract: Extremely large aperture array operating in the near-field regime unlocks
additional spatial resources that can be exploited to simultaneously serve
multiple users even when they share the same angular direction, a capability
not achievable in conventional far-field systems. A fundamental question,
however, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of
spatial multiplexing in the distance domain?
  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF
of a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit
aperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at
the same angular direction) but located at different distances from the
transmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are
continuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and
infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees
of freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case
where the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad
side of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral
operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form
expression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows
that the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the
extreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We
further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a
projection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent
broadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular
array, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the
constraint of the physical length of the array.

Motivation: 研究对称Toeplitz协方差矩阵在相位校准和波束转向相位误差下的估计能力。

Method: 分析了对称Toeplitz协方差矩阵的特性及其在相位误差下的稳定性。

Result: 展示了对称Toeplitz矩阵可以独立于相位误差进行估计的独特能力。

Conclusion: 对称Toeplitz协方差矩阵在相位误差下具有独特的估计优势，为解决相关问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: In several applications, one must estimate a real-valued (symmetric) Toeplitz
covariance matrix, typically shifted by the conjugated diagonal matrices of
phase progression and phase "calibration" errors. Unlike the Hermitian Toeplitz
covariance matrices, these symmetric matrices have a unique potential
capability of being estimated regardless of these beam-steering phase
progression and/or phase "calibration" errors. This unique capability is the
primary motivation of this paper.

Result: 证明了N=2K是紧下界，算法在多样问题实例中成功识别参数，且性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 论文首次提供了唯一可识别性的充要条件，并验证了算法的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that a necessary condition for unique
identifiability of $K$ chirps from $N$ regularly spaced samples of their
mixture is $N\geq 2K$ when $K\geq 2$. A necessary and sufficient condition is
that a rank-constrained matrix optimization problem has a unique solution; this
is the first result of such kind. An algorithm is proposed to solve the
optimization problem and to identify the parameters numerically. The lower
bound of $N=2K$ is shown to be tight by providing diverse problem instances for
which the proposed algorithm succeeds to identify the parameters. The
advantageous performance of the proposed algorithm is also demonstrated
compared with the state of the art.

Abstract: This paper investigates the system design and experimental validation of
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) for environmental sensing, which is
expected to be a critical enabler for next-generation wireless networks. We
advocate exploiting orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation for its
inherent sparsity and stability in delay-Doppler (DD) domain channels,
facilitating a low-overhead environment sensing design. Moreover, a
comprehensive environmental sensing framework is developed, encompassing DD
domain channel estimation, target localization, and experimental validation. In
particular, we first explore the OTFS channel estimation in the presence of
fractional delay and Doppler shifts. Given the estimated parameters, we propose
a three-ellipse positioning algorithm to localize the target's position,
followed by determining the mobile transmitter's velocity. Additionally, to
evaluate the performance of our proposed design, we conduct extensive
simulations and experiments using a software-defined radio (SDR)-based platform
with universal software radio peripheral (USRP). The experimental validations
demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmarks in terms of
localization accuracy and velocity estimation, confirming its effectiveness in
practical environmental sensing applications.

Abstract: Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) combined with orthogonal time
frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising technique for
high-mobility scenarios. However, its performance could be severely degraded
due to channel aging caused by user mobility and high processing latency. In
this paper, an integrated scheme of uplink (UL) channel estimation and downlink
(DL) channel prediction is proposed to alleviate channel aging in time division
duplex (TDD) massive MIMO-OTFS systems. Specifically, first, an iterative basis
expansion model (BEM) based UL channel estimation scheme is proposed to
accurately estimate UL channels with the aid of carefully designed OTFS frame
pattern. Then a set of Slepian sequences are used to model the estimated UL
channels, and the dynamic Slepian coefficients are fitted by a set of
orthogonal polynomials. A channel predictor is derived to predict DL channels
by iteratively extrapolating the Slepian coefficients. Simulation results
verify that the proposed UL channel estimation and DL channel prediction
schemes outperform the existing schemes in terms of normalized mean square
error of channel estimation/prediction and DL spectral efficiency, with less
pilot overhead.

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial in industrial environments. Visible
Light Communication (VLC) has emerged as a promising solution, offering high
accuracy, energy efficiency, and minimal electromagnetic interference. However,
VLC-based indoor localization faces challenges due to environmental
variability, such as lighting fluctuations and obstacles. To address these
challenges, we propose a Transfer Learning (TL)-based approach for VLC-based
indoor localization. Using real-world data collected at a BOSCH factory, the TL
framework integrates a deep neural network (DNN) to improve localization
accuracy by 47\%, reduce energy consumption by 32\%, and decrease computational
time by 40\% compared to the conventional models. The proposed solution is
highly adaptable under varying environmental conditions and achieves similar
accuracy with only 30\% of the dataset, making it a cost-efficient and scalable
option for industrial applications in Industry 4.0.

### [7] [Frequency-switching Array Enhanced Physical-Layer Security in Terahertz Bands: A Movable Antenna Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01624)
*Cong Zhou,Changsheng You,Shuo Shi,Weidong Mei*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型频率切换阵列（FSA）增强的太赫兹频段物理层安全系统，通过灵活控制载波频率参数，有效防止信息窃听，并优于固定位置阵列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统移动天线（MAs）在硬件和信号处理上的限制，同时提升物理层安全性能。

Method: 通过频率切换实现类似可移动天线的稀疏阵列效果，结合最大比率传输波束成形和块坐标下降法优化设计。

Result: FSA能够在角度和距离域灵活实现零陷，显著提升保密速率性能。

Conclusion: FSA克服了MA的硬件限制，提供更高的安全性和灵活性，优于传统固定位置阵列。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new frequency-switching array (FSA) enhanced
physical-layer security (PLS) system in terahertz bands, where the carrier
frequency can be flexibly switched and small frequency offsets can be imposed
on each antenna at Alice, so as to eliminate information wiretapping by
undesired eavesdroppers. First, we analytically show that by flexibly
controlling the carrier frequency parameters, FSAs can effectively form
uniform/non-uniform sparse arrays, hence resembling movable antennas (MAs) in
the control of inter-antenna spacing and providing additional degree-of-freedom
(DoF) in the beam control. Although the proposed FSA experiences additional
path-gain attenuation in the received signals, it can overcome several hardware
and signal processing issues incurred by MAs, such as limited positioning
accuracy, considerable response latency, and demanding hardware and energy
cost. To shed useful insights, we first consider a secrecy-guaranteed problem
with a null-steering constraint for which maximum ratio transmission (MRT)
beamformer is considered at Alice and the frequency offsets are set as uniform
frequency increment. Interestingly, it is shown that the proposed FSA can
flexibly realize null-steering over Eve in both the angular domain (by tuning
carrier frequency) and range domain (by controlling per-antenna frequency
offset), thereby achieving improved PLS performance. Then, for the general
case, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex
problem by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) and projected gradient
ascent (PGA) techniques. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the convergence
of the proposed optimization algorithm and its superiority over fixed-position
arrays (FPAs) in terms of secrecy-rate performance.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: UniToCom提出了一种统一的token通信范式，通过生成信息瓶颈（GenIB）优化token表示，提高通信效率并降低计算复杂度，同时还解决了自回归建模中的方差塌缩问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现高效的多模态通信，需要一种能够统一处理离散和连续token的方法，同时解决token表示中信息保留和生成的挑战。

Method: 提出了基于GenIB的token表示方法，并引入σ-GenIB解决方差塌缩问题，同时在接收端采用因果Transformer的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）统一处理token。

Result: 仿真结果表明UniToCom在动态信道条件下优于基线方法，具有更高的通信效率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniToCom为下一代智能通信提供了可扩展和多模态理解的解决方案，结合了token处理与MLLM的优势。

Abstract: This letter proposes UniToCom, a unified token communication paradigm that
treats tokens as the fundamental units for both processing and wireless
transmission. Specifically, to enable efficient token representations, we
propose a generative information bottleneck (GenIB) principle, which
facilitates the learning of tokens that preserve essential information while
supporting reliable generation across multiple modalities. By doing this,
GenIB-based tokenization is conducive to improving the communication efficiency
and reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$-GenIB
to address the challenges of variance collapse in autoregressive modeling,
maintaining representational diversity and stability. Moreover, we employ a
causal Transformer-based multimodal large language model (MLLM) at the receiver
to unify the processing of both discrete and continuous tokens under the
next-token prediction paradigm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
and superiority of the proposed UniToCom compared to baselines under dynamic
channel conditions. By integrating token processing with MLLMs, UniToCom
enables scalable and generalizable communication in favor of multimodal
understanding and generation, providing a potential solution for
next-generation intelligent communications.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a core technology for future
wireless networks, enabling high-resolution sensing and reliable data
transmission within a unified radio platform. This paper develops a theoretical
framework to assess the estimation accuracy of target position and velocity in
heterogeneous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC
networks with multiple cooperative and distributed multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) base stations (BSs). Using Fisher information analysis,
we first derive closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for target
localization in single monostatic and bistatic configurations. We then analyze
the benefits of BS cooperation by deriving CRLBs for joint position and
velocity estimation in a general setting that encompasses multiple cooperating
monostatic systems and multistatic networks with multiple transmitters (Txs)
and receivers (Rxs). The influence of key system parameters, including the
number of BSs, bandwidth, antenna array configuration, and network geometry, is
systematically examined. Numerical results highlight the performance gains
enabled by cooperative sensing and provide insights to guide the design of
future ISAC systems.

Result: 在多种轨道测试案例中，该方法显著提高了计算效率并保持了高精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在计算效率和精度之间取得了平衡，适用于复杂的轨道不确定性传播问题。

Abstract: Accurate propagation of orbital uncertainty is essential for a range of
applications within space domain awareness. Adaptive Gaussian mixture-based
approaches offer tractable nonlinear uncertainty propagation through splitting
mixands to increase resolution in areas of stronger nonlinearities, as well as
by reducing mixands to prevent unnecessary computational effort. Recent work
introduced principled heuristics that incorporate information from the system
dynamics and initial uncertainty to determine optimal directions for splitting.
This paper develops adaptive uncertainty propagation methods based on these
robust splitting techniques. A deferred splitting algorithm tightly integrated
with higher-order splitting techniques is proposed and shown to offer
substantial gains in computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
Second-order propagation of mixand moments is also seen to improve accuracy
while retaining significant computational savings from deferred splitting.
Different immediate and deferred splitting methods are compared in three
representative test cases, including a geostationary orbit, a Molniya orbit,
and a periodic three-body orbit.

Result: 结果表明，该方法在实测数据上有效，适用于ISAC系统中的联合检测和估计任务。

Conclusion: 基于CNN的方法在合成数据上训练后，能够成功应用于实测数据，解决了复杂场景中目标检测和估计的挑战。

Abstract: In wireless sensing applications, such as ISAC, one of the first crucial
signal processing steps is the detection and estimation targets from a channel
estimate. Effective algorithms in this context must be robust across a broad
SNR range, capable of handling an unknown number of targets, and
computationally efficient for real-time implementation. During the last decade,
different Machine Learning methods have emerged as promising solutions, either
as standalone models or as complementing existing techniques. However, since
models are often trained and evaluated on synthetic data from existing models,
applying them to measurement is challenging. All the while, training directly
on measurement data is prohibitive in complex propagation scenarios as a
groundtruth is not available. Therefore, in this paper, we train a CNN approach
for target detection and estimation on synthetic data and evaluate it on
measurement data from a suburban outdoor measurement. Using knowledge of the
environment as well as available groundtruth positions, we study the detection
probability and accuracy of our approach. The results demonstrate that our
approach works on measurement data and is suitable for joint detection and
estimation of sensing targets in ISAC systems.

### [12] [Cross-Attention Message-Passing Transformers for Code-Agnostic Decoding in 6G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01038)
*Seong-Joon Park,Hee-Youl Kwak,Sang-Hyo Kim,Yongjune Kim,Jong-Seon No*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer架构的AI原生基础模型，用于6G网络中的统一、代码无关的解码，具有灵活性、可扩展性和高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络的信道编码需要支持多样化的通信场景，传统解码器缺乏灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出了基于交叉注意力机制的消息传递Transformer（CrossMPT），并进一步开发了基础模型FCrossMPT和集成解码器CrossED。

Result: CrossMPT实现了单神经解码器中最佳的解码性能，FCrossMPT和CrossED能够广泛适应不同编码类型。

Conclusion: AI原生解码器为6G网络的信道编码提供了灵活、可扩展且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Channel coding for 6G networks is expected to support a wide range of
requirements arising from heterogeneous communication scenarios. These demands
challenge traditional code-specific decoders, which lack the flexibility and
scalability required for next-generation systems. To tackle this problem, we
propose an AI-native foundation model for unified and code-agnostic decoding
based on the transformer architecture. We first introduce a cross-attention
message-passing transformer (CrossMPT). CrossMPT employs two masked
cross-attention blocks that iteratively update two distinct input
representations-magnitude and syndrome vectors-allowing the model to
effectively learn the decoding problem. Notably, our CrossMPT has achieved
state-of-the-art decoding performance among single neural decoders. Building on
this, we develop foundation CrossMPT (FCrossMPT) by making the architecture
invariant to code length, rate, and class, allowing a single trained model to
decode a broad range of codes without retraining. To further enhance decoding
performance, particularly for short blocklength codes, we propose CrossMPT
ensemble decoder (CrossED), an ensemble decoder composed of multiple parallel
CrossMPT blocks employing different parity-check matrices. This architecture
can also serve as a foundation model, showing strong generalization across
diverse code types. Overall, the proposed AI-native code-agnostic decoder
offers flexibility, scalability, and high performance, presenting a promising
direction to channel coding for 6G networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态指纹定位中模态贡献随条件变化及NLOS场景下定位精度低的问题。

Method: 使用软混合专家（MoE）框架自适应融合多种信号特征，并通过空间聚类和辅助损失函数优化训练。

Result: 在三种实际城区布局和频段（2.6、6、28 GHz）下，模型实现亚米级定位误差，NLOS场景误差减半。

Conclusion: SCADF-MoE首次利用大规模多模态MoE实现了频率稳健的ISAC定位。

Abstract: Multimodal fingerprinting is a crucial technique to sub-meter 6G integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) localization, but two hurdles block
deployment: (i) the contribution each modality makes to the target position
varies with the operating conditions such as carrier frequency, and (ii)
spatial and fingerprint ambiguities markedly undermine localization accuracy,
especially in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. To solve these problems, we
introduce SCADF-MoE, a spatial-context aware dynamic fusion network built on a
soft mixture-of-experts backbone. SCADF-MoE first clusters neighboring points
into short trajectories to inject explicit spatial context. Then, it adaptively
fuses channel state information, angle of arrival profile, distance, and gain
through its learnable MoE router, so that the most reliable cues dominate at
each carrier band. The fused representation is fed to a modality-task MoE that
simultaneously regresses the coordinates of every vertex in the trajectory and
its centroid, thereby exploiting inter-point correlations. Finally, an
auxiliary maximum-mean-discrepancy loss enforces expert diversity and mitigates
gradient interference, stabilizing multi-task training. On three real urban
layouts and three carrier bands (2.6, 6, 28 GHz), the model delivers consistent
sub-meter MSE and halves unseen-NLOS error versus the best prior work. To our
knowledge, this is the first work that leverages large-scale multimodal MoE for
frequency-robust ISAC localization.

Conclusion: RIS技术的应用为JSDM提供了一种低复杂度、高效的实现方式，展示了其在未来通信系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer the unique capability to
reshape the radio environment, thereby simplifying transmission schemes
traditionally contingent on channel conditions. Joint spatial division and
multiplexing (JSDM) emerges as a low-overhead transmission scheme for
multi-user equipment (UE) scenarios, typically requiring complex matrix
decomposition to achieve block-diagonalization of the effective channel matrix.
In this study, we introduce an innovative JSDM design that leverages RISs to
customize channels, thereby streamlining the overall procedures. By
strategically positioning RISs at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
directions of the base station (BS), we establish orthogonal line-of-sight
links within the BS-RIS channel, enabling a straightforward pre-beamforming
design. Based on UE grouping, we devise reflected beams of the RIS with
optimized directions to mitigate inter-group interference in the RISs-UEs
channel. An approximation of the channel cross-correlation coefficient is
derived and serves as a foundation for the RISs-UEs association, further
diminishing inter-group interference. Numerical results substantiate the
efficacy of our RIS-customized JSDM in not only achieving effective channel
block-diagonalization but also in significantly enhancing the sum spectral
efficiency for multi-UE transmissions.

been developed, each tailored according to distinct power allocation factors.
We then proposed two algorithms, namely navigation-prioritized-algorithm (NPA)
and communication-prioritized-algorithm (CPA), to improve the navigation or
communication performance by selecting the satellite with the optimized
position dilution of precision (PDoP) or with the best channel gain. The
effectiveness of the proposed STAR-RIS-aided INAC network is quantified by
analyzing the positioning error for navigation services and by evaluating
communication performance through achievable ergodic rate metrics. Our
satellite selection approach indicates that: the positioning services at the
urban canyon users can be completed with the aid of STAR-RIS. 2) Additionally,
it is observed that while a single STAR-RIS array can extend the navigational
link, it fails to serve users in indoor scenarios, highlighting a limitation in
the current system design.

Conclusion: 该方法为CF mMIMO系统在大规模网络中的实际部署提供了可行性参考。

Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) has emerged as a
prominent candidate for future networks due to its ability to significantly
enhance spectral efficiency by eliminating inter-cell interference. However,
its practical deployment faces considerable challenges, such as high
computational complexity and the optimization of its complex processing. To
address these challenges, this correspondence proposes a framework based on a
sparse multi-dimensional graph neural network (SP-MDGNN), which sparsifies the
connections between access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) to
significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining high
performance. In addition, the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)
algorithm is introduced as a comparative method to further analyze the
trade-off between performance and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate
that the sparse method achieves an optimal balance between performance and
complexity, significantly reducing the computational complexity of the original
MDGNN method while incurring only a slight performance degradation, providing
insights for the practical deployment of CF mMIMO systems in large-scale
network.

Abstract: With the rapid development of aerial infrastructure, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) that function as aerial base stations (ABSs) extend terrestrial network
services into the sky, enabling on-demand connectivity and enhancing emergency
communication capabilities in cellular networks by leveraging the flexibility
and mobility of UAVs. In such a UAV-assisted network, this paper investigates
position-based beamforming between ABSs and ground users (GUs). To mitigate
inter-cell interference, we propose a novel fluid aerial network that leverages
ABS rotation to increase multi-cell capacity and overall network efficiency.
Specifically, considering the line-of-sight channel model, the spatial
beamforming weights are determined by the orientation angles of the GUs. In
this direction, we examine the beamforming gain of a two-dimensional
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array at various ground positions,
revealing that ABS rotation significantly affects multi-user channel
correlation and inter-cell interference. Based on these findings, we propose an
alternative low-complexity algorithm to design the optimal rotation angle for
ABSs, aiming to reduce inter-cell interference and thus maximize the sum rate
of multi-cell systems. In simulations, exhaustive search serves as a benchmark
to validate the optimization performance of the proposed sequential ABS
rotation scheme. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that, in
interference-limited regions, the proposed ABS rotation paradigm can
significantly reduce inter-cell interference in terrestrial networks and
improve the multi-cell sum rate by approximately 10\% compared to
fixed-direction ABSs without rotation.

TL;DR: mmBack是一种低功耗、无时钟反向散射标签，可同步多传感器数据采集和复用，减少了传统设计中的空间和成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反向散射标签仅支持单传感器，且多路复用设计依赖时钟或复杂调制链，增加了成本和尺寸。

Method: mmBack通过共享参考信号同步传感器输入，利用电压分配方案复用多传感器数据，并通过频率跟踪算法和状态机解码。

Result: mmBack原型支持5个5kHz或3个18kHz传感器流，SNR平均超过15dB。

Conclusion: mmBack提供了一种高效、低成本的多传感器反向散射解决方案。

Abstract: Backscatter tags provide a low-power solution for sensor applications, yet
many real-world scenarios require multiple sensors-often of different types-for
complex sensing tasks. However, existing designs support only a single sensor
per tag, increasing spatial overhead. State-of-the-art approaches to
multiplexing multiple sensor streams on a single tag rely on onboard clocks or
multiple modulation chains, which add cost, enlarge form factor, and remain
prone to timing drift-disrupting synchronization across sensors.
  We present mmBack, a low-power, clock-free backscatter tag that enables
synchronous multi-sensor data acquisition and multiplexing over a single
modulation chain. mmBack synchronizes sensor inputs in parallel using a shared
reference signal extracted from ambient RF excitation, eliminating the need for
an onboard timing source. To efficiently multiplex sensor data, mmBack designs
a voltage-division scheme to multiplex multiple sensor inputs as backscatter
frequency shifts through a single oscillator and RF switch. At the receiver,
mmBack develops a frequency tracking algorithm and a finite-state machine for
accurate demultiplexing. mmBack's ASIC design consumes 25.56uW, while its
prototype supports 5 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidths of up to 5kHz
and 3 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidth of up to 18kHz. Evaluation shows
that mmBack achieves an average SNR surpassing 15dB in signal reconstruction.

Abstract: Vocoders, encoding speech signals into acoustic features and allowing for
speech signal reconstruction from them, have been studied for decades.
Recently, the rise of deep learning has particularly driven the development of
neural vocoders to generate high-quality speech signals. On the other hand, the
existing end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds
the speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech,
resulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and
resonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying
speech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation
usually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption.
In this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech
as sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process
to propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech
signals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to
model the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the
amplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the
speech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting
and time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network
size decrease. The experiments indicate that the proposed method leverages the
strengths of QHM, the ARMA model, and neural networks, leading to the
outperformance of our methods over other methods in terms of generation speed,
synthesis quality, and modification flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在处理心脏生物信号（如ECG和PPG）时依赖同质数据和静态模型，限制了其鲁棒性和泛化性。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的模型和生成式掩码预训练策略，整合多模态数据（包括来自170万个体的心脏信号及文本报告）。

Result: CSFM在多场景下表现优异，支持跨模态迁移学习，并在多种配置（如单导联或多导联ECG）中展现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CSFM是一种多功能、可扩展的解决方案，适用于全面的心脏监测。

Abstract: Cardiac biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmograms
(PPG), are of paramount importance for the diagnosis, prevention, and
management of cardiovascular diseases, and have been extensively used in a
variety of clinical tasks. Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing
these signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,
limiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings
and acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing
foundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a
generative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from
vast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative
multi-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including
MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the
corresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7
million individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM
not only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing
scenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input
configurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic
tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical
outcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently
outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits
robust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard
12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only
PPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the
potential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive
cardiac monitoring.

Method: 通过在13个博物馆房间的90件艺术品前收集RSS数据，并使用邻近性方法和k-NN算法建立分类基线。

Result: 提供了BAR数据集和分类基线，为博物馆环境中的定位算法开发与评估提供了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了博物馆环境RSS数据集的空白，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) hold significant potential for enhancing
visitor experiences in cultural heritage institutions. By enabling personalized
navigation, efficient artifact organization, and better interaction with
exhibits, IPSs can transform the modalities of how individuals engage with
museums, galleries and libraries. However, these institutions face several
challenges in implementing IPSs, including environmental constraints, technical
limits, and limited experimentation. In other contexts, Received Signal
Strength (RSS)-based approaches using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi have
emerged as preferred solutions due to their non-invasive nature and minimal
infrastructure requirements. Nevertheless, the lack of publicly available RSS
datasets that specifically reflect museum environments presents a substantial
barrier to developing and evaluating positioning algorithms designed for the
intricate spatial characteristics typical of cultural heritage sites. To
address this limitation, we present BAR, a novel RSS dataset collected in front
of 90 artworks across 13 museum rooms using two different platforms, i.e.,
Android and iOS. Additionally, we provide an advanced position classification
baseline taking advantage of a proximity-based method and $k$-NN algorithms. In
our analysis, we discuss the results and offer suggestions for potential
research directions.

Abstract: Location information serves as the fundamental element for numerous Internet
of Things (IoT) applications. Traditional indoor localization techniques often
produce significant errors and raise privacy concerns due to centralized data
collection. In response, Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising
solutions by capturing indoor environment variations. However, they typically

Federated Learning (FL)-based approach for dynamic indoor localization using a
Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Experimental results show that FL has the
nearby performance to Centralized Model (CL) while keeping the data privacy,
bandwidth efficiency and server reliability. This research demonstrates that
our proposed FL approach provides a viable solution for privacy-enhanced indoor
localization, paving the way for advancements in secure and efficient indoor
localization systems.

Conclusion: SubLoRA结合了理论保证、二阶准确性和实用效率，显著提升了LoRA的秩确定性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SubLoRA, a rank determination method for Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) based on submodular function maximization. In contrast to
prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)
approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information
to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian
matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned
when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a
more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate
the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a
quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in
general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular
function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with
approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under
which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a
closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition
while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid
theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational
efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,
alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank
budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms
existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.
