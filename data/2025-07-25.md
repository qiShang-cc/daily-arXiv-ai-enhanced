### [1] [Time and Frequency Synchronization for Multiuser OTFS in Uplink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17966)
*Mohsen Bayat,Sanoopkumar P. S.,Arman Farhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了高移动场景下多用户OTFS系统的时频同步技术，重点解决了定时偏移和载波频率偏移的估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高移动场景下，多用户OTFS系统的时频同步对定位用户导频和提高信道估计精度至关重要。

Method: 提出了基于循环前缀的导频结构（SU-PCP和MU-PCP），并开发了基于相关性和滤波器组的定时偏移估计技术，以及基于CPF-BEM的载波频率偏移估计技术。

Result: 提出的方法能有效估计和纠正定时偏移与载波频率偏移，提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的技术为高移动场景下的多用户OTFS系统提供了高效的时频同步解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose time and frequency synchronization techniques for
uplink multiuser OTFS (MU-OTFS) systems in high-mobility scenarios. This work
focuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and
carrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for
locating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances
channel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an
existing multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot
(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix
(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs
different Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via
correlation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a
correlation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot
structure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is
proposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the
delay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO
estimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'
signals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical
threshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major
peak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest
peak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the
proposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique
reduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into
multiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the
Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to
effectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO
estimates for all the users.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于动态超表面天线（DMA）的流体天线系统（FAS）的完整分析模型，解决了现有电子可重构天线在分析建模上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于电子可重构天线在实际应用中难以进行理论建模，限制了流体天线系统（FAS）的理论分析和系统设计，因此需要一种完整的分析方法。

Method: 论文通过电路理论将传统的FAS信号模型改写为考虑超表面电磁效应的导纳矩阵形式，并使用全波仿真验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的模型为FAS的设计和分析提供了理论支持，展示了超表面天线在实现高效FAS中的潜力。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) have become a popular topic in the wireless
community as an effective yet simple means of exploiting spatial diversity. Due
to the limitations of physically moving radiating elements, electronically
reconfigurable antennas are emerging as practical implementations of FASs,
since changing the radiation pattern is functionally equivalent to physically
moving the device. However, electronically reconfigurable antennas pose a
challenge in terms of analytical modeling, often requiring full-wave
simulations or measurements for their characterization; this severely limits
the extraction of theoretical insights useful for system design. Motivated by
these difficulties and the growing interest in FASs, we propose in this paper a
complete analytical model for metasurface-based embodiments of FASs.
Specifically, we advocate for the implementation of the FAS concept through
dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), hitherto proposed as array replacements in
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We leverage circuit theory to
rewrite the conventional signal model of FASs in terms of admittance matrices
accounting for the electromagnetic effects inherent to metasurfaces. The model
is validated with full-wave simulations, showing good agreement. We further
illustrate how to apply the model for standard performance analysis, and
provide closed-form expressions for key metrics, including the resulting signal
covariance matrix. Results confirm that practical DMA-based FASs can achieve
similar performance to that of idealized implementations of position-flexible
antennas.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了一种基于多活性STAR-RIS的集成感知与通信网络，通过联合优化BS波束形成器和STAR-RIS的反射/透射系数，最大化通信总速率，同时满足感知、安全和功耗约束。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提算法在满足约束条件下，通信总速率显著优于被动RIS和单STAR-RIS基线。

Conclusion: 通过多活性STAR-RIS的联合优化，能够有效提升网络性能，同时满足复杂约束条件。

Abstract: This paper explores an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network
empowered by multiple active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). A base station (BS) furnishes
downlink communication to multiple users while concurrently interrogating a
sensing target. We jointly optimize the BS transmit beamformer and the
reflection/transmission coefficients of every active STAR-RIS in order to
maximize the aggregate communication sum-rate, subject to (i) a stringent
sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement, (ii) an
upper bound on the leakage of confidential information, and (iii) individual
hardware and total power constraints at both the BS and the STAR-RISs. The
resulting highly non-convex program is tackled with an efficient alternating
optimization (AO) framework. First, the original formulation is reformulated
into an equivalent yet more tractable representation and partitioned into
subproblems. The BS beamformer is updated in closed form via the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, whereas the STAR-RIS reflection and
transmission vectors are refined through successive convex approximation (SCA),
yielding a semidefinite program that is then solved via semidefinite
relaxation. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
delivers substantial sum-rate gains over passive-RIS and single STAR-RIS
baselines, all the while rigorously meeting the prescribed sensing and security
constraints.

### [4] [Geometrical portrait of Multipath error propagation in GNSS Direct Position Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18096)
*Jihong Huang,Rong Yang,Wei Gao,Xingqun Zhan,Zheng Yao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了几何分析方法，量化GNSS信号中多径误差对DPE的影响，并通过SCMB模型和蒙特卡洛模拟验证最大PVT偏差的边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPE方法在多径环境下的误差缺乏理论分析，研究旨在填补这一空白，量化多径引起的CAF和PVT偏差。

Method: 采用几何分析框架，建立SCMB模型，结合蒙特卡洛模拟和城市峡谷测试验证多径误差的几何特性。

Result: 最大PVT偏差与多径误差最大值相关，且随卫星高度角增加而变大；需平衡高低高度角卫星选择以优化几何配置。

Conclusion: 研究为DPE卫星选择提供几何参考，证明多径误差对PVT的显著影响，强调卫星高度角组合的重要性。

Abstract: Direct Position Estimation (DPE) is a method that directly estimate position,
velocity, and time (PVT) information from cross ambiguity function (CAF) of the
GNSS signals, significantly enhancing receiver robustness in urban
environments. However, there is still a lack of theoretical characterization on
multipath errors in the context of DPE theory. Geometric observations highlight
the unique characteristics of DPE errors stemming from multipath and thermal
noise as estimation bias and variance respectively. Expanding upon the
theoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this
paper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying
the deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative
to the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)
model is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite
channels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established
through discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness
of the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo
simulations and urban canyon tests. The findings indicate that the maximum PVT
bias depends on the largest multipath errors observed across various satellite
channels. Additionally, the PVT bias increases with satellite elevation angles,
influenced by the CAF multipath bias projection. This serves as a reference for
selecting DPE satellites from a geometric standpoint, underscoring the
importance of choosing a balanced combination of high and low elevation angles
to achieve an optimal satellite geometry configuration.

### [5] [Envelope Control Enabled Probabilistic Shaping for Peak Power Constrained IM DD Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18149)
*Dongdong Zou,Wei Wang,Jiawen Yao,Zhongxing Tian,Zeyu Feng,Huan Huang,Fan Li,Gordon Ning Liu,Gangxiang Shen,Yi Cai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的间接概率成形（PS）方案，专为峰值功率约束的IM-DD系统设计，通过动态选择性映射机制和改进的M-BCJR算法，显著提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于IM-DD系统的独特模型和固有约束，PS技术的应用仍是一个开放性问题，尤其在存在记忆效应的系统中。

Method: 提出动态选择性映射（DSLM）机制和改进的M-BCJR算法，以控制信号包络并恢复模糊比特。

Result: 在56GBaud PAM8系统中实验验证，接收灵敏度提升1dB，并兼容典型概率振幅成形架构。

Conclusion: 该研究为PS技术在有记忆效应的PPC IM-DD系统中的应用开辟了新视角。

Abstract: Probabilistic shaping (PS) has attracted significant attention in
intensity-modulation and direct-detection (IM-DD) systems. However, due to the
unique system model and inherent constraints, the effective application of the
PS technique is still an open question in IM-DD systems, particularly in
systems with memory effects. In this paper, a novel indirect PS scheme tailored
for peak power constrained (PPC) IM-DD systems is proposed. The key idea lies
in strategically controlling the signal envelope to mitigate memory-induced
impairments, such as nonlinearity, overshoot, peak-to-average power ratio
enhancement, etc. The proposed scheme incorporates a dynamic selective mapping
(DSLM) mechanism at the transmitter, enabling an untypical bit-to-symbol
mapping in which the current symbol is not only determined by the current bits
pattern but also by previously generated symbols within a specified memory
length. At the receiver side, a turbo equalizer with a modified M-BCJR
algorithm is proposed to achieve the recovery of ambiguous bits induced by
DSLM. Experimental verification in a 56GBaud PAM8 system demonstrates that the
proposed scheme exhibits 1dB receiver sensitivity improvement over 2km
single-mode fiber transmission. In addition, the proposed scheme has also been
demonstrated to be compatible with the typical probabilistic amplitude shaping
architecture, enabling a simple and fine-granularity rate adaptation
capability. To the best of our knowledge, this work opens a new sight for the
application of the PS technique in PPC IM-DD systems with memory effects.

### [6] [GNSS Jammer and Spoofer Mitigation via Multi-Antenna Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18166)
*Jonas Elmiger,Gian Marti,Christoph Studer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SCHIEBER是一种新型多天线GNSS接收器方法，无需先验知识即可抑制干扰和欺骗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代定位依赖GNSS信号，但易受干扰和欺骗攻击的影响，需要一种无需先验知识的解决方案。

Method: 结合自适应空间滤波技术和信号一致性测试，分别抑制干扰和识别欺骗信号。

Result: 通过GPS L1 C/A系统的仿真验证，该方法能有效应对干扰和欺骗攻击。

Conclusion: SCHIEBER为GNSS接收器提供了一种无需先验知识的抗干扰和抗欺骗解决方案。

Abstract: Modern positioning relies on radio signals from global navigation satellite
systems (GNSS). Their low receive power renders these radio signals susceptible
to jamming attacks, in which malicious transmitters emit strong interference to
disrupt signal acquisition. Moreover, GNSS are vulnerable to spoofing attacks,
in which malicious transmitters mimic legitimate satellites by transmitting
spurious GNSS signals. We propose SCHIEBER, a novel method for multi-antenna
GNSS receivers that mitigates jammers as well as spoofers without requiring any
prior knowledge of the receiver position or attack type: Jammers are mitigated
during signal acquisition using a recently developed adaptive spatial filtering
technique. Spoofers are identified and rejected after signal acquisition using
a novel approach that tests the consistency of acquired signals by comparing
their respective direction of arrival (DoA) and pseudorange estimates in a test
that is invariant with respect to the unknown receiver position. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our method using extensive simulations of a GPS L1 C/A system
under spoofing and jamming attacks.

### [7] [ICWLM: A Multi-Task Wireless Large Model via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18167)
*Yuxuan Wen,Xiaoming Chen,Maojun Zhang,Zhaoyang Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型无线基础模型ICWLM，支持多任务学习，解决了传统深度学习在无线通信中的任务局限性和数据不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信技术（如mMIMO和mmWave）的快速发展增加了网络复杂性和计算需求，传统深度学习方法在多任务学习和泛化性方面表现不足。

Method: 提出ICWLM模型，通过大规模无线数据集从头训练，联合解决多用户预编码和信道预测等任务，利用上下文学习和动态权重平均算法实现高效多任务训练。

Result: ICWLM在性能上与任务专用方法相当，并展示出卓越的泛化能力，适用于未见过的系统配置。

Conclusion: ICWLM为未来无线网络提供了统一且自适应的人工智能模型，可降低部署复杂性并提升资源管理智能化。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies, particularly
massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave),
introduces significant network complexity and computational demands.
Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer
performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are
usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model
(ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous
multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that
adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is
trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It
jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user
precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A
key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL),
enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel
conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive
retraining. Furthermore, we employ the Dynamic Weight Averaging (DWA) algorithm
to dynamically balance the individual task losses during multi-task training,
ensuring efficient and stable learning across diverse objectives. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance
compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization
capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising
paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless
networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent
resource management.

### [8] [Quantized Signal Recovery with Interference via Parametrized Look-Up Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18370)
*Morriel Kasher,Michael Tinston,Predrag Spasojevic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 通过使用查找表（LUT）并对输入信号、噪声和干扰进行建模，优化了一种高效的数字后校正方法，显著提高了低分辨率ADC的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低分辨率模拟-数字转换器（ADC）的性能常受噪声和干扰影响，需高效数字后校正方法提升精度。

Method: 结合参数模型优化LUT，评估三种分析估计器，并针对特定信号提出近似方法以提升可计算性。

Result: 仿真验证了实时高精度恢复输入信号的能力，显著优于传统线性滤波方法，尤其在消除谐波失真方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法为低分辨率、非线性或宽带量化器提供了一种高效、鲁棒的数字后校正方案。

Abstract: Efficient all-digital post-correction of low-resolution analog-to-digital
converters can be achieved by using Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The performance of a
LUT can be optimized by incorporating a parametric model for the expected input
signal, noise level, and interference signals. We evaluate three analytical
estimators for integration with parametrized LUTs, especially with applications
to low-resolution, non-linear, or wideband quantizers. We also propose several
approximations to improve tractability of the estimation problem for
Phase-Shift Keyed input signals and Linear Frequency Modulated interference
signals. Simulated results validate the ability of our estimator to recover the
instantaneous value of the desired input signal in real-time with a high degree
of accuracy. This includes cancellation of harmonic distortion that aliases
into the desired signal bandwidth from front-end saturation due to high-power
out-of-band interference. Our estimators are shown to achieve a significant
gain over conventional linear-filtering techniques while also being robust to
changes in input parameters, non-linear quantizers, and time-variant
interference sources. For a tone input quantized to 3 bits and estimated with a
fixed 12-tap model order we achieve $>$10 dB improvement in Mean Square Error
and $>$20 dBc improvement in Spurious-Free Dynamic Range.

### [9] [A Foundation Model for Massive MIMO Precoding with an Adaptive per-User Rate-Power Tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18587)
*Jérôme Emery,Ali Hasanzadeh Karkan,Jean-François Frigon,François Leduc-Primeau*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的基础模型，用于大规模多输入多输出（mMIMO）系统中的预编码，以降低发送端能耗并动态适应用户速率需求，同时在数据稀缺环境下通过数据增强方法解决模型适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模MIMO系统中，深度学习（DL）被用于预编码，但需要高质量本地数据集训练模型，这些数据往往难以收集。本文旨在解决这一数据获取和训练复杂性问题。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的基础模型，并结合数据增强技术，通过预训练特征提取器的余弦相似性找到目标分布的相似训练样本。

Result: 在相同能耗下，零样本部署该模型显著优于零强制预编码，并接近加权最小均方误差性能，复杂度降低8倍。

Conclusion: 该研究通过解决数据稀缺和训练复杂性问题，实现了DL预编码的实际应用，并为高层资源分配和调度算法提供了更优的能效、频谱效率和公平性控制能力。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化非线性最小二乘滤波方法，用于独立子系统组成的系统，利用协方差交叉算法防止信息重复计算，并通过机器人-地标定位问题验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多子系统状态估计中因共享信息导致的双重计数问题，提出了一种模块化滤波方法。

Method: 采用模块化非线性最小二乘滤波，结合协方差交叉算法，独立更新子系统的状态和误差协方差估计。

Result: 在机器人-地标定位问题的仿真实验中，该方法表现良好，并与联合状态滤波方法进行了对比。

Conclusion: 模块化方法在减少通信和带宽需求的同时，能够优雅地降低性能损失。

Abstract: In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach
for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance
estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative
measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We
integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in
order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates
with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least
squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the
proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem,
noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position
measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation
problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized
simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic
joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we
also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful
degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth
requirements.

*Jiajia Guo,Chao-Kai Wen,Xiao Li,Shi Jin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的PCEnet框架，通过用户位置信息提升无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统的信道获取效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少信道获取开销，利用用户位置信息作为不同信道之间的桥梁，提升信道估计和反馈效率。

Method: 利用神经网络从获取的信道中推断用户位置，并通过共享位置信息设计导频符号和重构其他信道。此外，提出了简化策略和无标签位置方法以减少延迟和标注需求。

Result: 仿真结果显示，PCEnet框架可将导频和反馈开销减少高达50%。

Conclusion: PCEnet通过用户位置信息显著提升信道获取性能，同时简化了系统设计。

Abstract: To reduce channel acquisition overhead, spatial, time, and frequency-domain
channel extrapolation techniques have been widely studied. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation
framework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel
characteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel
acquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments
between different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective
channels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique
across all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages
the position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the
characteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to
assist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach
first utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the
obtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central
processing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and
concatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to
reconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition
performance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the
estimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the
pilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position
label-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the
absolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during
the localization NN training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
PCEnet framework reduces pilot and feedback overheads by up to 50%.

Conclusion: 所提算法能有效优化LAE系统中的资源分配和隐蔽传输性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) is an emerging business model, which heavily
relies on integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), mobile edge computing
(MEC), and covert communications. This paper investigates the convert
transmission design in MEC-based networked ISAC systems towards LAE, where an
MEC server coordinates multiple access points to simultaneously receive
computation tasks from multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), locate a
target in a sensing area, and maintain UAVs' covert transmission against
multiple wardens. We first derive closed-form expressions for the detection
error probability (DEP) at wardens. Then, we formulate a total energy
consumption minimization problem by optimizing communication, sensing, and
computation resources as well as UAV trajectories, subject to the requirements
on quality of MEC services, DEP, and radar signal-to-interference-and-noise
ratio, and the causality of UAV trajectories. An alternating optimization based
algorithm is proposed to handle the considered problem, which decomposes it
into two subproblems: joint optimization of communication, sensing, and
computation resources, and UAV trajectory optimization. The former is addressed
by a successive convex approximation based algorithm, while the latter is
solved via a trust-region based algorithm. Simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with various benchmarks, and
reveal the trade-offs among communication, sensing, and computation in LAE
systems.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

baseline drift, and random spikes. This paper presents a comprehensive approach
to generating and preprocessing Raman spectra. Additionally, we describe
methods for fitting Voigt peaks to the spectrum to determine peak parameters.
The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated using both synthetic and
real Raman spectra, with code provided in an open-source GitHub repository.
