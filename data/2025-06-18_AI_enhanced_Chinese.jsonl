At high speeds and in cluttered environments, Doppler shifts and rapid multipath changes can dramatically raise packet error rates. This paper investigates these phenomena in the context of ExpressLRS (ELRS) long-range FPV control links and demonstrates a novel solution: real-time geometry tuning of a circularly polarized helical antenna array. This study integrates Maxwell-equation-based full-wave simulations (via Ansys HFSS) with controlled, blind field trials to validate performance. A new analysis framework incorporates Doppler-induced frequency offset into the antenna's radiation pattern and the system's error model. Compared to a conventional fixed antenna, the adaptive helical array shows a 20-30% PER reduction when drones exceed 150 mph. The adaptive system automatically adjusts coil pitch and diameter to retune the antenna as flight parameters (velocity, attitude) change. Measured VSWR stays near unity, preventing transmitter reflection spikes. RSSI variation is reduced by half, indicating stronger link stability in urban multi-path. A regression analysis confirms that the reduction in PER due to tuning is highly statistically significant. Calibration data and error analyses are provided to validate our methodology. These findings advance the understanding of high-mobility UAV communication channels and demonstrate that reconfigurable hardware-here, mechanically tunable helices-can effectively counter Doppler and multi-path impairments. The findings inform new design principles for UAV antenna arrays and suggest a path toward AI-integrated adaptive RF systems for drone swarms and racing platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u901f\u65e0\u4eba\u673aFPV\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u8c03\u87ba\u65cb\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u548c\u591a\u5f84\u6548\u5e94\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bef\u5305\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u901f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u98de\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u9891\u79fb\u548c\u591a\u5f84\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\u8bef\u5305\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Maxwell\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5168\u6ce2\u4eff\u771f(Ansys HFSS)\u4e0e\u76f2\u6d4b\u573a\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u87ba\u8ddd\u548c\u76f4\u5f84\u7684\u87ba\u65cb\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901f\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7150 mph\u65f6\u8bef\u5305\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8620-30%\uff0c\u4e14VSWR\u63a5\u8fd11\uff0cRSSI\u6ce2\u52a8\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u8c03\u87ba\u65cb\u5929\u7ebf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u9ad8\u901f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, in practice, as the number of antennas at the access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this challenge, this paper considers a hybrid near-far field activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO, and establishes a covariance-based formulation, which facilitates the development of a distributed algorithm to alleviate the computational burden at the central processing unit (CPU). Specifically, each AP performs local activity detection for the devices and then transmits the detection result to the CPU for further processing. In particular, a novel coordinate descent algorithm based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury update with Taylor expansion is proposed to handle the local detection problem at each AP. Moreover, we theoretically analyze how the hybrid near-far field channels affect the detection performance. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u7531\u5927\u89c4\u6a21 MIMO \u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8fd1\u8fdc\u573a\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e2d\u592e\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8fdc\u573a\u4f20\u64ad\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6df7\u5408\u8fd1\u8fdc\u573a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408 Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury \u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u8fd1\u8fdc\u573a\u4fe1\u9053\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u8fd1\u8fdc\u573a\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

By incorporating WLP principles, we derive a tailored formulation suited to the network structure and propose the CELM augmented by widely linear least squares (CELM-WLLS) for post-distortion. The proposed approach offers enhanced communication robustness and is highly effective for satellite communication scenarios characterized by dynamic channel conditions and non-linear impairments. CELM-WLLS is designed to improve signal recovery performance and outperform traditional methods such as least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). Compared to CELMAH, CELM-WLLS demonstrates approximately 0.8 dB gain in BER performance, and also achieves a two-thirds reduction in computational complexity, making it a more efficient solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408CELMAH\u548cWLP\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u540e\u8865\u507f\u65b9\u6848CELM-WLLS\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u56fa\u6709\u635f\u4f24\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408CELMAH\u67b6\u6784\u4e0eWLP\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCELM-WLLS\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u5931\u771f\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "CELM-WLLS\u5728BER\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd50.8 dB\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e8c\u3002", "conclusion": "CELM-WLLS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis.

This evolution is built upon a deepening understanding of the fundamental principles governing these ultra-low-power links. Modern backscatter systems are no longer simple reflectors of continuous waves but are increasingly designed to interact with complex, data-carrying ambient signals from ubiquitous sources like WiFi, ZigBee, and cellular networks. This review systematically charts the journey of ambient backscatter, particularly focusing on its interaction with ZigBee and other commodity wireless protocols over the last decade. We analyze the progression from foundational proof-of-concept systems that established productive backscatter to modern high-throughput, concurrent, and cross-technology communication architectures. Key advancements in fine-grained modulation, robust synchronization, cross-technology physical layer emulation, and multi-tag coordination are detailed. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art systems highlights the core trade-offs between performance metrics like data rate and range, power consumption, and compatibility with commodity hardware. Finally, we synthesize the primary challenges, including networking scalability, security vulnerabilities, the near-far problem, and practical deployment hurdles, and outline future research directions, such as integration with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and 6G networks, that promise to further expand the capabilities of this transformative technology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u4eceRFID\u5230\u65e0\u7535\u6c60\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u4e0eZigBee\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u8de8\u6280\u672f\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0eZigBee\u7b49\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u8fd1\u5341\u5e74\u6765\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8c03\u5236\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u8de8\u6280\u672f\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u534f\u8c03\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6743\u8861\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u3001\u529f\u8017\u548c\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u672a\u6765\u6709\u671b\u4e0eRIS\u548c6G\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

The proposed approach addresses the limitations of traditional radar-based ego-motion estimation techniques by employing a neural network to process complex-valued raw radar data and estimate instantaneous linear ego-velocity along with its associated uncertainty. This uncertainty-aware velocity estimate is then integrated with inertial measurement unit data using an Extended Kalman Filter. The filter leverages the network-predicted uncertainty to refine the inertial sensor's noise and bias parameters, improving the overall robustness and accuracy of the ego-motion estimation.

The achievable FDMA rate region is also derived using the same optimization framework, while the TDMA rate region is obtained through an antenna position refinement approach.

When such errors are significant, considerable performance losses can be observed if the wireless transceiver is not adapted. Instead of refining the estimate by increasing the pilot sequence length or improving the estimation algorithm, we propose two new approaches based on Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) decoders. The first method involves testing multiple candidates for the channel estimate located in the complex neighborhood around the original pilot-based estimate. All these candidates are employed in parallel to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLR). These LLRs are used as soft input to Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND). Posterior likelihood formulas associated with ORBGRAND are then computed to determine which channel candidate leads to the most probable codeword. The second method is a refined version of the first approach accounting for the presence of residual CEE in the LLR computation. The performance of these two techniques is evaluated for [128,112] 5G NR CA-Polar and CRC codes. For the considered settings, block error rate (BLER) gains of several dBs are observed compared to cases where CEE is ignored.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGRAND\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea0\u6b63\u8870\u843d\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff08CEE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u4e2a\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528ORBGRAND\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u7801\u5b57\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8870\u843d\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0d\u8c03\u6574\u65e0\u7ebf\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u6d4b\u8bd5\u56f4\u7ed5\u539f\u59cb\u5bfc\u9891\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97LLR\u5e76\u8f93\u5165ORBGRAND\u30022. \u5728LLR\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u6b8b\u4f59CEE\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u672c\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f305G NR CA-Polar\u548cCRC\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5ffd\u7565CEE\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5e26\u6765\u51e0dB\u7684\u5757\u8bef\u7801\u7387\uff08BLER\uff09\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eGRAND\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8870\u843d\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5ffd\u7565CEE\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
