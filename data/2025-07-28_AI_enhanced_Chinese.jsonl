This methodology decomposes the intractable LUT design problem\ninto four distinct stages, each of which is addressed analytically using a\nmodel-driven approach without reliance on training. Three dithering methods are\nstudied to improve spectral purity metrics. Two novel indexing schemes are\nproposed to limit the LUT memory overhead shown to compress the LUT size by\nover four orders of magnitude with marginal performance loss. The LUT design is\ntested with an oversampled noisy sinusoidal input quantized to 3 bits and shown\nto improve its Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) by over 19 dBc with only 324\nbytes of memory while maintaining the same 3-bit fixed-point precision at the\ndigital output.

The resulting hybrid sequence is\ndecoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while\nadopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model\ntraining, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the\ndiscontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the\ncodec's implicit interpolation during decoding.
