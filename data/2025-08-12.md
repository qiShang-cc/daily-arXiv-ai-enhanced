### [1] [A Completely Blind Channel Estimation Technique for OFDM Using Generalized Constellation Splitting and Modified Phase-Directed Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06508)
*Sameera Bharadwaja H.,D. K. Mehra*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了SISO-OFDM系统中的盲信道估计问题，比较了两种基于二阶统计量的方法，并提出了一种利用广义星座分裂和改进的相位导向算法来解决估计模糊性的盲方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SISO-OFDM系统中盲信道估计的模糊性问题，避免使用导频符号以保持盲方法的纯粹性。

Method: 提出了一种结合广义星座分裂和改进的相位导向算法的盲方法，用于解决传统方法中的复数标量估计模糊性。

Result: 通过MATLAB数值模拟验证了所提算法的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了盲信道估计中的模糊性问题，同时避免了导频符号的使用，保持了盲技术的优势。

Abstract: The problem of blind channel estimation for SISO-OFDM systems using
second-order statistics (SOS) is addressed. A comparison of two prominent
SOS-based techniques: subspace-decomposition and precoding-induced
correlation-averaging techniques in terms of MSE performance is presented. The
drawback of these methods is that they suffer from a complex-scalar estimation
ambiguity which is resolved by using pilots or reference symbols. By using
pilots the whole purpose of blind techniques is contradicted. We propose an
algorithm to resolve this ambiguity in blind manner using generalized
constellation-splitting and modified phase-directed algorithm. The performance
of the proposed scheme is evaluated via numerical simulations in MATLAB
environment.

### [2] [GPU-accelerated Direct Geolocation of GNSS Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06672)
*Jacob S. Clements,Zachary L. Clements*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用GPU并行计算加速直接地理定位的方法，以解决GNSS干扰检测中的高计算需求问题，并评估了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，GNSS干扰的急剧增加对依赖GNSS的民用应用造成了严重问题，而当前许多GNSS接收器缺乏有效的干扰防御措施。LEO卫星为干扰检测提供了新机会，但直接地理定位方法的高计算需求限制了其应用。

Method: 论文提出通过GPU并行计算优化直接地理定位方法，利用位置域相关性的独立性，将大多数计算任务并行化处理。

Result: GPU加速的直接地理定位显著降低了计算负担，提高了处理效率，优于传统的CPU处理方式。

Conclusion: GPU并行计算为直接地理定位提供了一种高效的解决方案，解决了高计算需求问题，适用于LEO卫星的GNSS干扰检测。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in Global Navigation
Satellite Systems (GNSS) interference, which has proven to be problematic in
GNSS-dependent civilian applications. Many currently deployed GNSS receivers
lack the proper countermeasures to defend themselves against interference,
prompting the need for alternative defenses. Satellites in Low Earth Orbit
(LEO) provide an opportunity for GNSS interference detection, classification,
and localization. The direct geolocation approach has been shown to be
well-suited for low SNR regimes and in cases limited to short captures --
exactly what is expected for receivers in LEO. Direct geolocation is a
single-step search over a geographical grid that enables estimation of the
transmitter location directly from correlating raw observed signals. However, a
key limitation to this approach is the computational requirements. This
computational burden is compounded for LEO-based receivers as the geographic
search space is extensive. This paper alleviates the computational burden of
direct geolocation by exploiting the independence of position-domain
correlation across candidate points and time steps: nearly all computation can
be accomplished in parallel on a graphics processing unit (GPU). This paper
presents and evaluates the performance of GPU-accelerated direct geolocation
compared to traditional CPU processing.

### [3] [Physical Layer Authentication Based on Hierarchical Variational Auto-Encoder for Industrial Internet of Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06794)
*Rui Meng,Xiaodong Xu,Bizhu Wang,Hao Sun,Shida Xia,Shujun Han,Ping Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于HVAE的PLA方案，用于IIoT环境中的身份认证，无需攻击者先验信道信息，且在少量训练数据下仍表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂的IIoT环境中，现有PLA方案需要攻击者的先验信道信息，当信号源未知时性能下降严重。

Method: 提出HVAE方案，结合AE模块和VAE模块提取CIR特征并进行认证，设计了新的目标函数。

Result: 仿真结果显示，HVAE在静态和移动IIoT场景中均优于其他PLA方案，即使在少量训练数据下。

Conclusion: HVAE方案在复杂环境中表现出色，无需攻击者先验信息，适合IIoT应用。

Abstract: Recently, Physical Layer Authentication (PLA) has attracted much attention
since it takes advantage of the channel randomness nature of transmission media
to achieve communication confidentiality and authentication. In the complex
environment, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), machine learning
(ML) is widely employed with PLA to extract and analyze complex channel
characteristics for identity authentication. However, most PLA schemes for IIoT
require attackers' prior channel information, leading to severe performance
degradation when the source of the received signals is unknown in the training
stage. Thus, a channel impulse response (CIR)-based PLA scheme named
"Hierarchical Variational Auto-Encoder (HVAE)" for IIoT is proposed in this
article, aiming at achieving high authentication performance without knowing
attackers' prior channel information even when trained on a few data in the
complex environment. HVAE consists of an Auto-Encoder (AE) module for CIR
characteristics extraction and a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) module for
improving the representation ability of the CIR characteristic and outputting
the authentication results. Besides, a new objective function is constructed in
which both the single-peak and the double-peak Gaussian distribution are taken
into consideration in the VAE module. Moreover, the simulations are conducted
under the static and mobile IIoT scenario, which verify the superiority of the
proposed HVAE over three comparison PLA schemes even with a few training data.

### [4] [Deep Domain-Adversarial Adaptation for Automatic Modulation Classification under Channel Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06829)
*K. A. Shahriar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于域对抗神经网络（DANN）的深度学习框架，旨在解决自动调制分类（AMC）中由信道引起的分布偏移问题。该方法在多种调制方案和信道条件下表现优异，比传统模型提升了14.93%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代认知和智能无线电系统中，准确识别调制方式对自适应通信至关重要。然而，异构无线信道条件（如瑞利和莱斯衰落）对传统AMC模型的泛化能力提出挑战。

Method: 采用域对抗神经网络（DANN）框架，显式缓解源域和目标域间的信道引起的分布偏移。实验使用了包含五种调制方案和多种信道条件的模拟数据集。

Result: DANN模型在某些调制案例中比仅基于源域训练的基线模型绝对准确率提高了14.93%。

Conclusion: 该研究证实了域对抗学习在AMC任务中的工程可行性，为未来自适应频谱智能研究提供了稳健方向。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) plays a significant role in modern
cognitive and intelligent radio systems, where accurate identification of
modulation is crucial for adaptive communication. The presence of heterogeneous
wireless channel conditions, such as Rayleigh and Rician fading, poses
significant challenges to the generalization ability of conventional AMC
models. In this work, a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) based deep
learning framework is proposed that explicitly mitigates channel-induced
distribution shifts between source and target domains. The approach is
evaluated using a comprehensive simulated dataset containing five modulation
schemes (BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM) across Rayleigh and Rician fading
channels at five frequency bands. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the
DANN-based model achieves up to 14.93% absolute accuracy improvement in certain
modulation cases compared to a baseline supervised model trained solely on the
source domain. The findings establish the engineering feasibility of domain
adversarial learning in AMC tasks under real-world channel variability and
offer a robust direction for future research in adaptive spectrum intelligence

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MA和RIS协同工作的高质量传播链路，以增强主次传输的安全性并抑制窃听风险。

Method: 针对连续和离散MA位置，提出了基于差分进化（DEO）的双层迭代优化方法和交替优化（AO）框架。

Result: 数值结果显示，所提方案及优化算法能有效提高主传输的保密性。

Conclusion: MA与RIS的协同优化在无蜂窝共生无线电系统中显著提升了传输的安全性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission
scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided cell-free symbiotic
radio (SR) system. Specifically, the MAs deployed at distributed access points
(APs) work collaboratively with the RIS to establish high-quality propagation
links for both primary and secondary transmissions, as well as suppressing the
risk of eavesdropping on confidential primary information. We consider both
continuous and discrete MA position cases and maximize the secrecy rate of
primary transmission under the secondary transmission constraints,
respectively. For the continuous position case, we propose a two-layer
iterative optimization method based on differential evolution with one-in-one
representation (DEO), to find a high-quality solution with relatively moderate
computational complexity. For the discrete position case, we first extend the
DEO based iterative framework by introducing the mapping and determination
operations to handle the characteristic of discrete MA positions. To further
reduce the computational complexity, we then design an alternating optimization
(AO) iterative framework to solve all variables within a single layer. In
particular, we develop an efficient strategy to derive the sub-optimal solution
for the discrete MA positions, superseding the DEO-based method. Numerical
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed MA empowered secure
transmission scheme along with its optimization algorithms.

Abstract: 6G networks will need to support higher data rates, high-precision
localization, and imaging capabilities. Near-field technologies, enabled by
extremely large-scale (XL)-arrays, are expected to be essential physical-layer
solutions to meet these ambitious requirements. However, implementing XL-array
systems using traditional fully-digital or hybrid analog/digital architectures
poses significant challenges due to high power consumption and implementation
costs. Emerging XL-dynamic metasurface antennas (XL-DMAs) provide a promising
alternative, enabling ultra-low power and cost-efficient solutions, making them
ideal candidates for 6G near-field networks. In this article, we discuss the
opportunities and challenges of XL-DMAs employed in 6G near-field networks. We
first outline the fundamental principles of XL-DMAs and present the specifics
of the near-field model of XL-DMAs. We then highlight several promising
applications that might benefit from XL-DMAs, including near-field
communication, localization, and imaging. Finally, we discuss several open
problems and potential future directions that should be addressed to fully
exploit the capabilities of XL-DMAs in the next 6G near-field networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波定位结合RIS技术可以实现无线传播环境的动态调控，从而提升定位精度。

Conclusion: 多RIS辅助的毫米波定位系统通过动态相位优化，可实现高精度定位，为下一代智能系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) positioning has emerged as a promising technology
for next-generation intelligent systems. The advent of reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) has revolutionized high-precision mmWave
localization by enabling dynamic manipulation of wireless propagation
environments. This paper investigates a three-dimensional (3D) multi-input
single-output (MISO) mmWave positioning system assisted by multiple RISs. We
introduce a measurement framework incorporating sequential RIS activation and
directional beamforming to fully exploit virtual line-of-sight (VLoS) paths.
The theoretical performance limits are rigorously analyzed through derivation
of the Fisher information and subsequent positioning error bound (PEB). To
minimize the PEB, two distinct optimization approaches are proposed for
continuous and discrete phase shift configurations of RISs. For continuous
phase shifts, a Riemannian manifold-based optimization algorithm is proposed.
For discrete phase shifts, a heuristic algorithm incorporating the grey wolf
optimizer is proposed. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in reducing the PEB and validate the
improvement in positioning accuracy achieved by multiple RISs.

*Ze Wang,Guoping Zhang,Hongbo Xu*

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的下行共生无线电框架，利用可重构天线定位的捏合天线系统（PASS）来提升主次传输性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过灵活调整天线位置，同时优化大规模路径损耗和信号相位，从而提升传输效率。

Method: 提出了两种优化策略：1）学习辅助梯度下降（LGD）算法，将问题转化为可微分形式；2）两阶段优化方法（SCA-PSO），结合凸近似和粒子群优化。

Result: SCA-PSO算法在降低计算复杂度的同时接近最优性能，避免了局部最优。

Conclusion: PASS框架通过优化天线位置和波束成形，有效提升了传输速率和系统性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel downlink symbiotic radio (SR) framework
empowered by the pinching antenna system (PASS), aiming to enhance both primary
and secondary transmissions through reconfigurable antenna positioning. PASS
consists of multiple waveguides equipped with numerous low-cost pinching
antennas (PAs), whose positions can be flexibly adjusted to simultaneously
manipulate large-scale path loss and signal phases.We formulate a joint
transmit and pinching beamforming optimization problem to maximize the
achievable sum rate while satisfying the detection error probability constraint
for the IR and the feasible deployment region constraints for the PAs. This
problem is inherently nonconvex and highly coupled. To address it, two solution
strategies are developed. 1) A learning-aided gradient descent (LGD) algorithm
is proposed, where the constrained problem is reformulated into a
differentiable form and solved through end-to-end learning based on the
principle of gradient descent. The PA position matrix is reparameterized to
inherently satisfy minimum spacing constraints, while transmit power and
waveguide length limits are enforced via projection and normalization. 2) A
two-stage optimization-based approach is designed, in which the transmit
beamforming is first optimized via successive convex approximation (SCA),
followed by pinching beamforming optimization using a particle swarm
optimization (PSO) search over candidate PA placements. The SCA-PSO algorithm
achieves performance close to that of the element-wise method while
significantly reducing computational complexity by exploring a randomly
generated effective solution subspace, while further improving upon the LGD
method by avoiding undesirable local optima.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在稀疏信号恢复时分辨率有限且对超参数敏感，影响了在非固定网格上的准确恢复能力。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方案在信道外插问题上优于基线方案。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法具有更高的分辨率和计算效率，适用于无线感知和通信应用。

Abstract: The problem of super-resolution compressive sensing (SR-CS) is crucial for
various wireless sensing and communication applications. Existing methods often
suffer from limited resolution capabilities and sensitivity to
hyper-parameters, hindering their ability to accurately recover sparse signals
when the grid parameters do not lie precisely on a fixed grid and are close to
each other. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel robust
super-resolution compressive sensing algorithmic framework using a
two-timescale alternating maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. At the slow
timescale, the proposed framework iterates between a sparse signal estimation
module and a grid update module. In the sparse signal estimation module, a
hyperbolic-tangent prior distribution based variational Bayesian inference
(tanh-VBI) algorithm with a strong sparsity promotion capability is adopted to
estimate the posterior probability of the sparse vector and accurately identify
active grid components carrying primary energy under a dense grid.
Subsequently, the grid update module utilizes the BFGS algorithm to refine
these low-dimensional active grid components at a faster timescale to achieve
super-resolution estimation of the grid parameters with a low computational
cost. The proposed scheme is applied to the channel extrapolation problem, and
simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared
to baseline schemes.

### [10] [Pinching-Antenna System Design with LoS Blockage: Does In-Waveguide Attenuation Matter?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07131)
*Yanqing Xu,Zhiguo Ding,Octavia A. Dobre,Tsung-Hui Chang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了波导内衰减在夹持天线系统中的影响，尤其是在非理想视距（LoS）条件下的性能损失，并提出了动态样本平均逼近（SAA）算法来优化多用户场景下的系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中常忽略波导内衰减以简化设计，但其对系统性能的影响缺乏深入研究，尤其是在非理想视距条件下。

Method: 研究首先分析单用户场景下的数据速率损失，推导出显式表达式；随后在多用户场景中，通过动态SAA算法联合优化天线位置和波束成形器。

Result: 结果表明，即使在大服务区域下，波导内衰减对速率的影响可忽略；动态SAA算法在LoS阻塞严重的环境中显著提升了系统性能。

Conclusion: 波导内衰减在典型LoS条件下影响可忽略，动态SAA算法为夹持天线系统在多用户场景中的性能优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the literature of pinching-antenna systems, in-waveguide attenuation is
often neglected to simplify system design and enable more tractable analysis.
However, its effect on overall system performance has received limited
attention in the existing literature. While a recent study has shown that, in
line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated environments, the data rate loss incurred by
omitting in-waveguide attenuation is negligible when the communication area is
not excessively large, its effect under more general conditions remains
unclear. This work extends the analysis to more realistic scenarios involving
arbitrary levels of LoS blockage. We begin by examining a single-user case and
derive an explicit expression for the average data rate loss caused by
neglecting in-waveguide attenuation. The results demonstrate that, even for
large service areas, the rate loss remains negligible under typical LoS
blockage conditions. We then consider a more general multi-user scenario, where
multiple pinching antennas, each deployed on a separate waveguide, jointly
serve multiple users. The objective is to maximize the average sum rate by
jointly optimize antenna positions and transmit beamformers to maximize the
average sum rate under probabilistic LoS blockage. To solve the resulting
stochastic and nonconvex optimization problem, we propose a dynamic sample
average approximation (SAA) algorithm. At each iteration, this method replaces
the expected objective with an empirical average computed from dynamically
regenerated random channel realizations, ensuring that the optimization
accurately reflects the current antenna configuration. Extensive simulation
results are provided to the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the substantial
performance gains of pinching-antenna systems, particularly in environments
with significant LoS blockage.

### [11] [Low-Complexity Equalization of Zak-OTFS in the Frequency Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07148)
*Sandesh Rao Mattu,Nishant Mehrotra,Saif Khan Mohammed,Venkatesh Khammammetti,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种低复杂度的频域（FD）均衡方法用于Zak-OTFS调制，显著降低了计算复杂度，同时性能接近传统DD域均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM在多普勒扩展下性能下降，Zak-OTFS虽对双选择性信道鲁棒，但均衡复杂度高。研究旨在降低Zak-OTFS均衡的计算负担。

Method: 提出频域（FD）均衡方法，推导FD系统模型，利用FD中信道矩阵的带状特性，应用共轭梯度法降低复杂度。

Result: FD均衡复杂度与Zak-OTFS帧维度线性相关，远低于传统MMSE的三次复杂度，仿真显示性能与DD域均衡相当。

Conclusion: FD均衡为Zak-OTFS提供了一种高效的低复杂度解决方案，适用于高速移动环境。

Abstract: 4G/5G wireless standards use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) which is robust to frequency selectivity. Equalization is possible with
a single tap filter, and low-complexity equalization makes OFDM an attractive
physical layer. However the performance of OFDM degrades with mobility, since
Doppler spreads introduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) between subcarriers
and they are no longer orthogonal. Zak-transform based orthogonal time
frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to be robust to doubly
selective channels. Zak-OTFS signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD)
domain, converted to time domain (TD) for transmission and reception, then
returned to the DD domain for processing. The received signal is a
superposition of many attenuated copies since the doubly selective channel
introduces delay and Doppler shifts. The received symbols are more difficult to
equalize since they are subject to interference along both delay and Doppler
axes. In this paper, we propose a new low-complexity method of equalizing
Zak-OTFS in the frequency domain (FD). We derive the FD system model and show
that it is unitarily equivalent to the DD system model. We show that the
channel matrix in the FD is banded, making it possible to apply conjugate
gradient methods to reduce the complexity of equalization. We show that
complexity of FD equalization is linear in the dimension of a Zak-OTFS frame.
For comparison the complexity of naive MMSE equalization is cubic in the frame
dimension. Through numerical simulations we show that FD equalization of
Zak-OTFS achieves similar performance as equalization in DD domain.

TL;DR: 论文提出将正交啁啾分复用（OCDM）扩展为向量OCDM（VOCDM），以提供更多设计自由度应对双选信道，并分析了其性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对双选信道（时频双选）的挑战，扩展OCDM为VOCDM以提供更多设计自由度和性能优化空间。

Method: 通过M个并行N点逆离散菲涅尔变换（IDFnT）实现VOCDM调制，并基于复数指数基扩展模型（CE-BEM）推导输入输出关系，分析调制参数M和N对性能和PAPR的影响。

Result: VOCDM在双选信道中表现出优越的分集性能，前提是参数M和N满足信道时延和多普勒扩展的约束；同时，PAPR随N的减小而降低。数值模拟验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: VOCDM通过参数优化在双选信道中实现了性能与PAPR的平衡，为实际通信系统提供了新的调制解决方案。

Abstract: In this letter, we extend orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) to
vector OCDM (VOCDM) to provide more design freedom to deal with doubly
selective channels. The VOCDM modulation is implemented by performing M
parallel N-size inverse discrete Fresnel transforms (IDFnT). Based on the
complex exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) for doubly selective
channels, we derive the VOCDM input-output relationship, and show performance
tradeoffs of VOCDM with respect to (w.r.t.) its modulation parameters M and N.
Specifically, we investigate the diversity and peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) of VOCDM w.r.t. M and N. Under doubly selective channels, VOCDM exhibits
superior diversity performance as long as the parameters M and N are configured
to satisfy some constraints from the delay and the Doppler spreads of the
channel, respectively. Furthermore, the PAPR of VOCDM signals decreases with a
decreasing N. These theoretical findings are verified through numerical
simulations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new technique for computer modeling linear filters
based on the spectral form of mathematical description of linear systems. It
assumes that input and output signals of the filter are represented as

two-dimensional non-stationary transfer functions. This technique allows one to
model the output signal in continuous time, and it is successfully tested on
the Butterworth, Linkwitz-Riley, and Chebyshev filters with different orders.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted integrated sensing and
communication (RIS-ISAC) presents a promising system architecture to leverage
the wide bandwidth available at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, while
mitigating severe signal propagation losses and reducing infrastructure costs.
To enhance ISAC functionalities in the future air-ground integrated network
applications, RIS deployment must be carefully designed and evaluated, which
forms the core motivation of this paper. To ensure practical relevance, a
multi-RIS-ISAC system is established, with its signal model at mmWave
frequencies demonstrated using ray-launching calibrated to real-world
environments. On this basis, an energy-efficiency-driven optimization problem
is formulated to minimize the multi-RIS size-to-coverage sum ratio,
comprehensively considering real-world RIS deployment constraints, positions,
orientations, as well as ISAC beamforming strategies at both the base station
and the RISs. To solve the resulting non-convex mixed-integer problem, a
simplified reformulation based on equivalent gain scaling method is introduced.
A two-step iterative algorithm is then proposed, in which the deployment
parameters are determined under fixed RIS positions in the first step, and the
RIS position set is updated in the second step to progressively approach the
optimum solution. Simulation results based on realistic parameter benchmarks
present that the optimized RISs deployment significantly enhances communication
coverage and sensing accuracy with the minimum RIS sizes, outperforming
existing approaches.

Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is considered as a key enabler
of the next-generation mobile radio systems. While attracting extensive
interest from academia and industry due to its passive nature and low cost,
scalability of RIS elements and requirement for channel state information (CSI)
are two major difficulties for the RIS to become a reality. In this work, we
introduce an unsupervised machine learning (ML) enabled optimization approach
to configure the RIS. The dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet is
combined with an implicit channel estimation method. The RISnet learns to map
from received pilot signals to RIS configuration directly without explicit
channel estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
outperforms baselines significantly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决城市复杂环境中非视距（NLoS）条件下的设备定位难题，通过EMS增强信道差异性和空间指纹。

Method: 采用基于码本的优化框架设计EMS相位分布，关注关键嵌入指标的上分位数、定位误差、可信度和连续性。

Result: 通过3D射线追踪仿真，优化EMS配置将90%分位定位误差从60米降至25米以下，并显著提升可信度和连续性。

Conclusion: 首次利用静态EMS增强信道图表（CC），在NLoS条件下取得显著的定位性能提升。

Abstract: This paper introduces the use of static electromagnetic skins (EMSs) to
enable robust device localization via channel charting (CC) in realistic urban
environments. We develop a rigorous optimization framework that leverages EMS
to enhance channel dissimilarity and spatial fingerprinting, formulating EMS
phase profile design as a codebook-based problem targeting the upper quantiles
of key embedding metric, localization error, trustworthiness, and continuity.
Through 3D ray-traced simulations of a representative city scenario, we
demonstrate that optimized EMS configurations, in addition to significant
improvement of the average positioning error, reduce the 90th-percentile
localization error from over 60 m (no EMS) to less than 25 m, while drastically
improving trustworthiness and continuity. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to exploit Smart Radio Environment (SRE) with static EMS for
enhancing CC, achieving substantial gains in localization performance under
challenging None-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions.

Abstract: Hydraulic systems have been one of the most used technologies in many
industries due to their reliance on incompressible fluids that facilitate
energy and power transfer. Within such systems, hydraulic cylinders are prime
devices that convert hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. Some of the
genuine and very common problems related to hydraulic cylinders are leakages.
Leakage in hydraulic systems can cause a drop in pressure, general
inefficiency, and even complete failure of such systems. The various ways
leakage can occur define the major categorization of leakage: internal and
external leakage. External leakage is easily noticeable, while internal
leakage, which involves fluid movement between pressure chambers, can be harder
to detect and may gradually impact system performance without obvious signs.
When leakage surpasses acceptable limits, it is classified as a fault or
failure. In such cases, leakage is divided into three categories: no leakage,
low leakage, and high leakage. It suggests a fault detection algorithm with the
basic responsibility of detecting minimum leakage within the Hydraulic system,
and minimizing detection time is the core idea of this paper. In order to fully
develop this idea, experimental data collection of Hydraulic systems is
required. The collected data uses pressure sensors and other signals that are
single-related. Due to the utilization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
recurrent neural networks, more complex data analysis was enabled, which the
LSTM-based leakage detection algorithm successfully achieved, providing almost
96% accuracy in classifying leakage types. Results demonstrate that the
proposed method can perform real-time and online fault diagnosis for each
cycle, reducing maintenance costs and prolonging the hydraulic system's
lifespan.

Motivation: 为解决汽车雷达系统中两个近距离目标的DOA估计问题。

Method: 使用FFT、MUSIC和压缩感知算法对模拟数据进行角度估计。

Result: FFT速度快但角分辨率差，MUSIC和压缩感知表现更优，具有超分辨率能力。

Conclusion: 在需要进行高分辨率角度估计的应用中，MUSIC和压缩感知比FFT更适用。

Abstract: The FMCW radars are widely used for automotive radar systems. The basic idea
for FMCW radars is to generate a linear frequency ramp as transmit signal. The
difference frequency, (i.e., beat frequency) between the transmitted and
received signal is determined after down conversion. The FFT operation on beat
frequency signal can recognize targets at different range and velocity.
Increasing demand on safety functionality leads to the Direction of Arrival
(DOA) estimation to resolve two closely located targets. Consequently, the
problem of angle estimation for 77GHz FMCW automotive radar simulated data has
been investigated in this term project. In particular, we examined the
performances of FFT, MUSIC and compressed sensing in angle estimation task, and
it was found that although FFT is the fastest algorithm, it has very poor
angular resolution when compared with others which are both super resolution
algorithms. The code for this project report is available at

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) present a breakthrough among the
flexible-antenna technologies, and distinguish themselves by facilitating
large-scale antenna reconfiguration, line-of-sight creation, scalable
implementation, and near-field benefits, thus bringing wireless communications
from the last mile to the last meter. A comprehensive tutorial is presented in
this paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS
signal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna
activation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity
limits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance
metrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its
superiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching
beamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is
first characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general
multiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for
PASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS,
namely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical
protocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications,
namely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing. A
possible implementation of PASS in wideband communications is further
highlighted. Moreover, the channel state information acquisition in PASS is
elaborated with a pair of promising solutions. To overcome the high complexity
and suboptimality inherent in conventional convex-optimization-based
approaches, machine-learning-based methods for operating PASS are also
explored, focusing on selected deep neural network architectures and training
algorithms. Finally, several promising applications of PASS in next-generation
wireless networks are highlighted.

Conclusion: 基于Remote ID的DMUCA框架能有效减少通信延迟，提升无人机碰撞避免性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is
paramount to ensure safe and efficient operations in open airspaces. The remote
identification (Remote ID) is deemed an effective real-time UAV monitoring
system by the federal aviation administration, which holds potentials for
enabling inter-UAV communications. This paper deeply investigates the
application of Remote ID for UAV collision avoidance while minimizing
communication delays. First, we propose a Remote ID based distributed multi-UAV
collision avoidance (DMUCA) framework to support the collision detection,
avoidance decision-making, and trajectory recovery. Next, the average
transmission delays for Remote ID messages are analyzed, incorporating the
packet reception mechanisms and packet loss due to interference. The
optimization problem is formulated to minimize the long-term average
communication delay, where UAVs can flexibly select the Remote ID protocol to
enhance the collision avoidance performance. To tackle the problem, we design a
multi-agent deep Q-network based adaptive communication configuration
algorithm, allowing UAVs to autonomously learn the optimal protocol
configurations in dynamic environments. Finally, numerical results verify the
feasibility of the proposed DMUCA framework, and the proposed mechanism can
reduce the average delay by 32% compared to the fixed protocol configuration.

Result: 在MVP-N数据集上的多视角图像分类任务中，IA-QSMPA在理想和有限块长传输场景下均显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IA-QSMPA是一种高效的语义通信资源分配框架，能够显著提升任务性能和通信效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel importance-aware quantization, subcarrier
mapping, and power allocation (IA-QSMPA) framework for semantic communication
in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) systems, empowered by a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT). The
proposed framework exploits attention-based importance extracted from a
pretrained ViT to jointly optimize quantization levels, subcarrier mapping, and
power allocation. Specifically, IA-QSMPA maps semantically important features
to high-quality subchannels and allocates resources in accordance with their
contribution to task performance and communication latency. To efficiently
solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, a block coordinate descent
algorithm is employed. The framework is further extended to operate under
finite blocklength transmission, where communication errors may occur. In this
setting, a segment-wise linear approximation of the channel dispersion penalty
is introduced to enable efficient joint optimization under practical
constraints. Simulation results on a multi-view image classification task using
the MVP-N dataset demonstrate that IA-QSMPA significantly outperforms
conventional methods in both ideal and finite blocklength transmission
scenarios, achieving superior task performance and communication efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，几何精度显著提升；在严重遮挡情况下，Chamfer Distance降低了15倍以上。

Conclusion: 触觉信号的集成有效提升了3DGS在视觉退化环境中的性能，且保持了在线处理的可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that integrates touch signals
(contact points and surface normals) into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our
approach enhances scene reconstruction, particularly under challenging
conditions like low lighting, limited camera viewpoints, and occlusions.
Different from the visual-only method, the proposed approach incorporates
spatially selective touch measurements to refine both the geometry and
appearance of the 3D Gaussian representation. To guide the touch exploration,
we introduce a two-stage sampling scheme that initially probes sparse regions
and then concentrates on high-uncertainty boundaries identified from the
reconstructed mesh. A geometric loss is proposed to ensure surface smoothness,
resulting in improved geometry. Experimental results across diverse scenarios
show consistent improvements in geometric accuracy. In the most challenging
case with severe occlusion, the Chamfer Distance is reduced by over 15x,
demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating touch cues into 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Furthermore, our approach maintains a fully online pipeline,
underscoring its feasibility in visually degraded environments.

design better approaches than general ML methods.

Abstract: This work explores the integration of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA),
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), and
beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) to enhance the
spectral-efficiency, energy-efficiency, coverage, and connectivity of future
sixth-generation (6G) communication networks. Specifically, with a multiuser
BD-RIS-empowered RSMA-SWIPT system, we jointly optimize the transmit precoding
vectors, the common rate proportion of users, the power-splitting ratios, and
scattering matrix of BD-RIS node, under the assumption of imperfect channel
state information (CSI). Additionally, to better capture practical hardware
behavior, we incorporate a nonlinear energy harvesting model under energy
harvesting constraints. We design a robust optimization framework to maximize
the system sum-rate, while explicitly accounting for the worst-case impact of
CSI uncertainties. Further, we introduce an alternating optimization framework
that partitions the problem into several blocks, which are optimized
iteratively. More specifically, the transmit precoding vectors are optimized by
reformulating the problem as a convex semidefinite programming through
successive-convex approximation (SCA), whereas the power-splitting problem is
solved using the MOSEK-enabled CVX toolbox. Subsequently, to optimize the
scattering matrix of the BD-RIS, we first employ SCA to reformulate the problem
into a convex form, and then design a manifold optimization strategy based on
the Conjugate-Gradient method. Finally, numerical simulation results reveal
that the proposed scheme provides significant performance improvements over
existing benchmarks and demonstrates rapid convergence within a reasonable
number of iterations.

Abstract: We propose a joint learning framework for Byzantine-resilient spectrum
sensing and secure intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)--assisted opportunistic
access under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty. The sensing stage
performs logit-domain Bayesian updates with trimmed aggregation and
attention-weighted consensus, and the base station (BS) fuses network beliefs
with a conservative minimum rule, preserving detection accuracy under a bounded
number of Byzantine users. Conditioned on the sensing outcome, we pose downlink
design as sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization under transmit-power and
signal-leakage constraints and jointly optimize the BS precoder, IRS phase
shifts, and user equalizers. With partial (or known) CSI, we develop an
augmented-Lagrangian alternating algorithm with projected updates and provide
provable sublinear convergence, with accelerated rates under mild local
curvature. With unknown CSI, we perform constrained Bayesian optimization (BO)
in a geometry-aware low-dimensional latent space using Gaussian process (GP)
surrogates; we prove regret bounds for a constrained upper confidence bound
(UCB) variant of the BO module, and demonstrate strong empirical performance of
the implemented procedure. Simulations across diverse network conditions show
higher detection probability at fixed false-alarm rate under adversarial
attacks, large reductions in sum MSE for honest users, strong suppression of
eavesdropper signal power, and fast convergence. The framework offers a
practical path to secure opportunistic communication that adapts to CSI
availability while coherently coordinating sensing and transmission through
joint learning.

Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) from remote sensing imagery requires models
balancing extensive spatial context, computational efficiency, and sensitivity
to class-imbalanced land-cover transitions. While Convolutional Neural Networks
excel at local feature extraction but lack global context, Transformers provide
global modeling at high computational costs. Recent Mamba architectures based

Spatio-Frequency Fusion block incorporating log-amplitude frequency domain
features to enhance edge clarity and suppress illumination artifacts, a
Change-Guided Attention (CGA) module that explicitly links the naturally
intertwined BCD and SCD tasks, and a Separated Kappa (SeK) loss tailored for
class-imbalanced performance optimization. Extensive evaluation on SECOND and
Landsat-SCD datasets shows that Mamba-FCS achieves state-of-the-art metrics,
88.62% Overall Accuracy, 65.78% F_scd, and 25.50% SeK on SECOND, 96.25% Overall
Accuracy, 89.27% F_scd, and 60.26% SeK on Landsat-SCD. Ablation analyses
confirm distinct contributions of each novel component, with qualitative
assessments highlighting significant improvements in SCD. Our results underline
the substantial potential of Mamba architectures, enhanced by proposed

Abstract: The ever-growing learning model size nowadays challenges the communication
efficiency and privacy preservation of the traditional federated learning (FL).
In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private (DP) over-the-air
federated distillation (FD) framework, where wireless devices (WDs)
periodically share noise-perturbed model outputs with the parameter server by
harnessing the superposition property of multi-access channels. Accordingly,
over-the-air FD enables the shared responsibility of the DP preservation on the
low-dimensional disclosed signals among WDs. We study the
communication-learning co-design problem in differentially private over-the-air
FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting the transmit
power and DP requirements of WDs. The main challenge is rooted in the
intractable learning and privacy analysis in over-the-air FD, together with the
strong coupling among the decision variables spanning two timescales. To tackle
this problem, we first derive the analytical learning convergence rate and
privacy losses of WDs, based on which the optimal transceiver design per FD
round and long-term training rounds decision are obtained in the closed forms.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed differentially private
over-the-air FD approach achieves a better learning-privacy trade-off with
largely-reduced communication overhead than the conventional FL benchmarks.

Abstract: Integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) has emerged as a key
enabler for low-altitude wireless networks with enhanced adaptability through
resource allocation co-design and intelligent environment awareness. However,
dynamic interference and channel attenuation constrain the potential of the
ISCC system. To address this challenge, we propose a novel movable
antenna-empowered ISCC system. An achievable data rate maximization problem is
formulated while guaranteeing the sensing and control quality-of-service (QoS)
by optimizing the positions of the antennas and the beamforming strategy for
communication, sensing, and control co-design. An efficient alternating
optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed to solve the highly coupled
non-convex problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed AO-based
algorithm achieves substantial gains in the achievable data rate and the
control QoS compared with benchmark schemes.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应源信道编码（ASCC）方案，用于解决语义通信（SemComs）中的兼容性和适应性问题，优于现有的深度联合源信道编码（JSCC）和分离源信道编码（SSCC）方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义通信中的JSCC方案与现有通信系统不兼容，且无法适应源或信道的变化；而SSCC在有限块长度下表现不佳。

Method: 提出ASCC方案，通过深度神经网络（DNN）基的语义源编码与传统数字信道编码的分离和自适应设计，优化E2E失真。

Result: 仿真结果表明，ASCC在单信道和平行信道场景下均优于典型的深度JSCC和SSCC方案，且保持与数字系统的兼容性。

Conclusion: ASCC方案有效解决了语义通信中的兼容性和性能优化问题，为实际系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic communications (SemComs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for
joint data and task-oriented transmissions, combining the demands for both the
bit-accurate delivery and end-to-end (E2E) distortion minimization. However,
current joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in SemComs is not compatible with
the existing communication systems and cannot adapt to the variations of the
sources or the channels, while separate source-channel coding (SSCC) is
suboptimal in the finite blocklength regime. To address these issues, we
propose an adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) scheme for SemComs over
parallel Gaussian channels, where the deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic
source coding and conventional digital channel coding are separately deployed
and adaptively designed. To enable efficient adaptation between the source and
channel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as
functions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic
regression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E
distortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power
allocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex
approximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASCC
scheme outperforms typical deep JSCC and SSCC schemes for both the single- and
parallel-channel scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with practical
digital systems.

TL;DR: 现代计算机架构中，内存密集型工作负载的性能受限于数据移动瓶颈。内存内计算（PiM）通过减少数据移动提升性能，本文分析了PiM在神经网络加速中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决内存与CPU间数据移动瓶颈，提升神经网络训练与推理的效率。

Method: 选用UPMEM PiM系统与Intel Xeon CPU比较，评估多层感知机（MLP）在PiM上的性能，并与低功耗GPU对比。

Result: UPMEM PiM在大批量推理中性能提升高达259倍，小规模MLP使用WRAM时执行时间接近低功耗GPU水平。

Conclusion: PiM架构显著加速神经网络推理，尤其在批量处理和大规模数据场景中表现优异，WRAM的使用使其接近GPU效率。

Abstract: In modern computer architectures, the performance of many memory-bound
workloads (e.g., machine learning, graph processing, databases) is limited by
the data movement bottleneck that emerges when transferring large amounts of
data between the main memory and the central processing unit (CPU).
Processing-in-memory is an emerging computing paradigm that aims to alleviate
this data movement bottleneck by performing computation close to or within the
memory units, where data resides. One example of a prevalent workload whose
performance is bound by the data movement bottleneck is the training and
inference process of artificial neural networks. In this work, we analyze the
potential of modern general-purpose PiM architectures to accelerate neural
networks. To this end, we selected the UPMEM PiM system, the first commercially
available real-world general-purpose PiM architecture. We compared the
implementation of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in PiM with a sequential
baseline running on an Intel Xeon CPU. The UPMEM implementation achieves up to
$259\times$ better performance for inference of large batch sizes when compared
against the CPU that exploits the size of the available PiM memory.
Additionally, two smaller MLPs were implemented using UPMEM's working SRAM
(WRAM), a scratchpad memory, to evaluate their performance against a low-power
Nvidia Jetson graphics processing unit (GPU), providing further insights into
the efficiency of UPMEM's PiM for neural network inference. Results show that
using WRAM achieves kernel execution times for MLP inference of under $3$ ms,
which is within the same order of magnitude as low-power GPUs.

Motivation: 6G网络需要解决多样化处理节点资源的统一访问问题，并构建一个多方贡献资源的协作生态系统，同时确保性能参数的精准匹配。

Method: 提出了一种基于顶层中介的资源分配方法，抽象不同基础设施的复杂性，简化服务部署。通过分体计算场景验证其多功能性。

Conclusion: 顶层中介是实现6G网络资源无缝整合与协作的高效解决方案，未来可扩展到更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: 6G network architectures will usher in a wave of innovative services and
capabilities, introducing concepts like split computing and dynamic processing
nodes. This implicates a paradigm where accessing resources seamlessly aligns
with diverse processing node characteristics, ensuring a uniform interface. In
this landscape, the identity of the operator becomes inconsequential, paving
the way for a collaborative ecosystem where multiple providers contribute to a
shared pool of resources. At the core of this vision is the guarantee of
specific performance parameters, precisely tailored to the location and service
requirements. A consistent layer, as the abstraction of the complexities of
different infrastructure providers, is needed to simplify service deployment.
One promising approach is the introduction of an over-the-top broker for
resource allocation, which streamlines the integration of these services into
the network and cloud infrastructure of the future. This paper explores the
role of the broker in two split computing scenarios. By abstracting the
complexities of various infrastructures, the broker proves to be a versatile
solution applicable not only to cloud environments but also to networks and
beyond. Additionally, a detailed discussion of a proof-of-concept
implementation provides insights into the broker's actual architectural
framework.

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the task of generating sign language video
from spoken language inputs. The field has seen a range of innovations over the
last few years, with the introduction of deep learning-based approaches
providing significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated
outputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP
approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address
this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part
of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to
evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a
sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a
range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche
Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a
custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents
the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33
participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team
achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach
utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part
of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including
high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent
baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare
their work against a broader range of methods.

Motivation: 探索如何利用通用预训练音频模型（如 CLAP 和 MERT）进行零样本混音兼容性评估，以改进自动混音系统。

Method: 使用 COCOLA 评估分离音轨的兼容性，并测试通用音频模型在混音兼容性估计中的表现。

Result: 混音兼容性具有不对称性（依赖音轨角色），且现有音频嵌入方法无法有效反映 COCOLA 测量的感知一致性。

Conclusion: 通用音频表示在混音兼容性评估中存在局限性，需进一步研究更专业的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce AutoMashup, a system for automatic mashup creation based on
source separation, music analysis, and compatibility estimation. We propose
using COCOLA to assess compatibility between separated stems and investigate
whether general-purpose pretrained audio models (CLAP and MERT) can support
zero-shot estimation of track pair compatibility. Our results show that mashup
compatibility is asymmetric -- it depends on the role assigned to each track
(vocals or accompaniment) -- and that current embeddings fail to reproduce the
perceptual coherence measured by COCOLA. These findings underline the
limitations of general-purpose audio representations for compatibility
estimation in mashup creation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件流匹配的语音增强方法，显著降低了计算复杂度，同时保持了与传统扩散模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型在语音增强中表现优异，但推理阶段需要大量计算，因此需要降低计算复杂度。

Method: 采用条件流匹配方法，通过训练连续归一化流来模拟概率路径，减少函数评估次数（NFE）。

Result: 在NFE为5时，性能与NFE为60的扩散模型相当；在NFE为1到5时，表现与修正反向过程的扩散模型相似，且无需额外微调。

Conclusion: 条件流匹配方法在计算效率和性能上均优于传统扩散模型，为语音增强提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have shown impressive performance for speech
enhancement, but they typically require 25 to 60 function evaluations in the
inference phase, resulting in heavy computational complexity. Recently, a
fine-tuning method was proposed to correct the reverse process, which
significantly lowered the number of function evaluations (NFE). Flow matching
is a method to train continuous normalizing flows which model probability paths
from known distributions to unknown distributions including those described by
diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose a speech enhancement based on
conditional flow matching. The proposed method achieved the performance
comparable to those for the diffusion-based speech enhancement with the NFE of
60 when the NFE was 5, and showed similar performance with the diffusion model
correcting the reverse process at the same NFE from 1 to 5 without additional
fine tuning procedure. We also have shown that the corresponding diffusion
model derived from the conditional probability path with a modified optimal
transport conditional vector field demonstrated similar performances with the
NFE of 5 without any fine-tuning procedure.

Conclusion: 成功实现了高效且高性能的语音增强，无需额外预测模型。

Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) based on diffusion probabilistic models has exhibited
impressive performance, while requiring a relatively high number of function
evaluations (NFE). Recently, SE based on flow matching has been proposed, which
showed competitive performance with a small NFE. Early approaches adopted the
noisy speech as the only conditioning variable. There have been other
approaches which utilize speech enhanced with a predictive model as another
conditioning variable and to sample an initial value, but they require a
separate predictive model on top of the generative SE model. In this work, we
propose to employ an identical model based on flow matching for both SE and
generating enhanced speech used as an initial starting point and a conditioning
variable. Experimental results showed that the proposed method required the
same or fewer NFEs even with two cascaded generative methods while achieving
equivalent or better performances to the previous baselines.

Motivation: 现实部署中，环境因素（如风速变化或电磁干扰）可能导致未观测到的噪声统计漂移，从而导致基于学习的方法性能下降。

Method: OTAKNet通过一步预测测量似然建立状态估计与漂移之间的联系，并利用最优传输（OT）的几何感知成本和稳定梯度，实现在线适应。

Result: 在合成和真实世界的NCLT数据集上，OTAKNet表现出优于传统的基于模型的卡尔曼滤波和离线学习方法的性能，尤其是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: OTAKNet是一种无需地面真值标签或重新训练的完全在线自适应方法，有效解决了噪声统计漂移问题。

Abstract: Learning-based filtering has demonstrated strong performance in non-linear
dynamical systems, particularly when the statistics of noise are unknown.
However, in real-world deployments, environmental factors, such as changing
wind conditions or electromagnetic interference, can induce unobserved
noise-statistics drift, leading to substantial degradation of learning-based
methods. To address this challenge, we propose OTAKNet, the first online
solution to noise-statistics drift within learning-based adaptive Kalman
filtering. Unlike existing learning-based methods that perform offline
fine-tuning using batch pointwise matching over entire trajectories, OTAKNet
establishes a connection between the state estimate and the drift via one-step
predictive measurement likelihood, and addresses it using optimal transport.
This leverages OT's geometry - aware cost and stable gradients to enable fully
online adaptation without ground truth labels or retraining. We compare OTAKNet
against classical model-based adaptive Kalman filtering and offline
learning-based filtering. The performance is demonstrated on both synthetic and
real-world NCLT datasets, particularly under limited training data.

Abstract: Reliable seizure detection is critical for diagnosing and managing epilepsy,
yet clinical workflows remain dependent on time-consuming manual EEG
interpretation. While machine learning has shown promise, existing approaches
often rely on dataset-specific optimisations, limiting their real-world
applicability and reproducibility. Here, we introduce an innovative,
open-source machine-learning framework that enables robust and generalisable
seizure detection across varied clinical datasets. We evaluate our approach on
two publicly available EEG datasets that differ in patient populations and
electrode configurations. To enhance robustness, the framework incorporates an
automated pre-processing pipeline to standardise data and a majority voting
mechanism, in which multiple models independently assess each second of EEG
before reaching a final decision. We train, tune, and evaluate models within
each dataset, assessing their cross-dataset transferability. Our models achieve
high within-dataset performance (AUC 0.904+/-0.059 for CHB-MIT and
0.864+/-0.060 for TUSZ) and demonstrate strong generalisation across datasets
despite differences in EEG setups and populations (AUC 0.615+/-0.039 for models
trained on CHB-MIT and tested on TUSZ and 0.762+/-0.175 in the reverse case)
without any post-processing. Furthermore, a mild post-processing improved the
within-dataset results to 0.913+/-0.064 and 0.867+/-0.058 and cross-dataset
results to 0.619+/-0.036 and 0.768+/-0.172. These results underscore the
potential of, and essential considerations for, deploying our framework in
diverse clinical settings. By making our methodology fully reproducible, we
provide a foundation for advancing clinically viable, dataset-agnostic seizure
detection systems. This approach has the potential for widespread adoption,
complementing rather than replacing expert interpretation, and accelerating
clinical integration.

Abstract: Accurate power consumption prediction is crucial for improving efficiency and
reducing environmental impact, yet traditional methods relying on specialized
instruments or rigid physical models are impractical for large-scale,
real-world deployment. This study introduces a scalable data-driven method
using powertrain dynamic feature sets and both traditional machine learning and
deep neural networks to estimate instantaneous and cumulative power consumption
in internal combustion engine (ICE), electric vehicle (EV), and hybrid electric
vehicle (HEV) platforms. ICE models achieved high instantaneous accuracy with
mean absolute error and root mean squared error on the order of $10^{-3}$, and
cumulative errors under 3%. Transformer and long short-term memory models
performed best for EVs and HEVs, with cumulative errors below 4.1% and 2.1%,
respectively. Results confirm the approach's effectiveness across vehicles and
models. Uncertainty analysis revealed greater variability in EV and HEV
datasets than ICE, due to complex power management, emphasizing the need for
robust models for advanced powertrains.

Abstract: Personalised music-based interventions offer a powerful means of supporting
motor rehabilitation by dynamically tailoring auditory stimuli to provide
external timekeeping cues, modulate affective states, and stabilise gait
patterns. Generalisable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) thus hold promise for
adapting these interventions across individuals. However, inter-subject
variability in EEG signals, further compounded by movement-induced artefacts
and motor planning differences, hinders the generalisability of BCIs and
results in lengthy calibration processes. We propose Individual Tangent Space
Alignment (ITSA), a novel pre-alignment strategy incorporating subject-specific
recentering, distribution matching, and supervised rotational alignment to
enhance cross-subject generalisation. Our hybrid architecture fuses Regularised
Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) with Riemannian geometry in parallel and
sequential configurations, improving class separability while maintaining the
geometric structure of covariance matrices for robust statistical computation.
Using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, `ITSA' demonstrates significant
performance improvements across subjects and conditions. The parallel fusion
approach shows the greatest enhancement over its sequential counterpart, with
robust performance maintained across varying data conditions and electrode
configurations. The code will be made publicly available at the time of
publication.

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of electroencephalography (EEG)
microstates and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the assessment of
cognitive load states. By utilizing EEG microstate features, the research aims
to fine-tune LLMs for improved predictions of distinct cognitive states,
specifically 'Rest' and 'Load'. The experimental design is delineated in four
comprehensive stages: dataset collection and preprocessing, microstate
segmentation and EEG backfitting, feature extraction paired with prompt
engineering, and meticulous LLM model selection and refinement. Employing a
supervised learning paradigm, the LLM is trained to identify cognitive load
states based on EEG microstate features integrated into prompts, producing
accurate discrimination of cognitive load. A curated dataset, linking EEG
features to specified cognitive load conditions, underpins the experimental
framework. The results indicate a significant improvement in model performance
following the proposed fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of EEG-informed
LLMs in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive AI applications. This approach not
only contributes to the understanding of brain dynamics but also paves the way
for advancements in machine learning techniques applicable to cognitive load
and cognitive AI research.
