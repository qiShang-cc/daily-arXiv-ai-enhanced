Compared to conventional\nCRB, BCRB is independent of the exact values of sensing parameters and is not\nrestricted by the unbiasedness of the estimator, thus offering a practical and\ncomprehensive lower bound for evaluating sensing performance. A system where\nmultiple targets transmit uplink pilots to a single-waveguide PASS under a\ntime-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is analyzed. For the single-target\nscenario, our analysis reveals a unique mismatch between the sensing centroid\n(i.e., the optimal PA position) and the distribution centroid (i.e., the center\nof the target's prior distribution), underscoring the necessity of dynamic PA\nrepositioning. For the multi-target scenario, two target scheduling protocols\nare proposed: 1) pinch switching (PS), which performs separate pinching\nbeamforming for each time slot, and 2) pinch multiplexing (PM), which applies a\nsingle beamforming configuration across all slots. Based on these protocols,\nboth the total power minimization problem under a BCRB threshold and the\nmin-max BCRB problem under a total power constraint are formulated. By\nleveraging Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, these problems are equivalently\nconverted into a search over PA positions and solved using an element-wise\nalgorithm.

Our first\ncontribution in this paper is to introduce the Cell MultiComplexes (CMCs),\nwhich are novel topological spaces that enable the representation of\nhigher-order interactions among interconnected cell complexes. We introduce\ncross-Laplacian operators as powerful algebraic descriptors of CMC spaces able\nto capture different topological invariants, whether global or local, at\ndifferent resolutions.

Two approaches, namely, model-dependent and model-free\napproaches, can be employed for this purpose. The model-dependent approach\nrequires explicit estimation of the physical channel parameters (path delays,\nDopplers, and gains) to obtain the I/O relation. Such an explicit estimation is\nnot required in the model-free approach, where the I/O relation can be\nestimated by reading off the samples in the fundamental DD period of the\nreceived pilot frame. Model-free approach has the advantage of acquiring\nfractional DD channels with simplicity. However, the read-off in the model-free\napproach provides an estimate of the effective channel only over a limited\nregion in the DD plane but it does not provide an estimate for the region\noutside, and this can affect the estimation performance depending on the pulse\nshaping characteristics of the DD pulse shaping filter used. A poorly localized\nDD pulse shape leads to an increased degradation in performance. Motivated by\nthis, in this paper, we propose a novel, yet simple, I/O relation estimation\nscheme that alleviates the above issue in the model-free approach. We achieve\nthis by obtaining a coarse estimate of the effective channel outside the\nmodel-free estimation region using a novel model-dependent scheme and using\nthis estimate along with the model-free estimate to obtain an improved estimate\nof the overall I/O relation.

All comments are welcome", "summary": "We study a generalized motion planning problem involving multiple autonomous\nrobots navigating in a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space in the presence of a set\nof obstacles whose positions are unknown a priori. Each robot is required to\nvisit sequentially a prescribed set of target states, with the number of\ntargets varying between robots. This heterogeneous setting generalizes the\nframework considered in the prior works on sequential parametrized topological\ncomplexity by Farber and the second author of this article. To determine the\ntopological complexity of our problem, we formulate it mathematically by\nconstructing an appropriate fibration. Our main contribution is the\ndetermination of this invariant in the generalized setting, which captures the\nminimal algorithmic instability required for designing collision-free motion\nplanning algorithms under parameter-dependent constraints. We provide a\ndetailed analysis for both odd and even-dimensional ambient spaces, including\nthe essential cohomological computations and explicit constructions of\ncorresponding motion planning algorithms."}

Conditions such as\nheavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to\nautomated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity\nmonitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on\nadvanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species\nclassification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to\ndevelop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a\nlimited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new\ndataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.\nCollected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes\nfeatures 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We\ndemonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking\nmodern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show\nthat, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)\nof 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP\nof only 35.69%.

Traditional centralized algorithms that have global\ninformation, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality\nsolutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to\nthe combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely,\ndistributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based\nmethods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information\navailability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path\nplanning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to\nadapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static\nconflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared\ninformation from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We\nempirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its\nplanning performance. Our approach reduces the inter-agent information sharing\ncompared to fully centralized and distributed methods, while still consistently\nfinding feasible, collision-free solutions--even in large-scale scenarios\nhaving higher agent counts."}

For\nany general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also\nmaster these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in\nembodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent\nof their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge\nthis gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating\nthe comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a\nVisual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.\nIt assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool\nRecognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool\nUnderstanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a\ntool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new\ntool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,\nspecialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in\ntool understanding.

In this\nwork, we introduce a multistable mechanical metamaterial that exhibits a\ntoggleable stiffness effect, where the effective shear stiffness switches\ndiscretely between stable configurations. The mechanical analysis of surrogate\nbeam models of the unit cell reveal that this behavior originates from the\nrotation transmitted by the support beams to the curved beam, which governs the\nbalance between bending and axial deformation. The stiffness ratio between the\ntwo states of the unit cell can be tuned by varying the slenderness of the\nsupport beams or by incorporating localized hinges that modulate rotational\ntransfer. Experiments on 3D-printed prototypes validate the numerical\npredictions, confirming consistent stiffness toggling across different\ngeometries. Finally, we demonstrate a monolithic soft clutch that leverages\nthis effect to achieve programmable, stepwise stiffness modulation. This work\nestablishes a design strategy for toggleable stiffness using multistable\nmetamaterials, paving the way for adaptive, lightweight, and autonomous systems\nin soft robotics and smart structures."}

Here, we present a\ncomparative psychophysical study that quantifies how visual and auditory\nstimuli combine to evoke pseudo-haptic pressure sensations on a commodity\ntablet. Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a\nvirtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were\ncaptured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain\nwas paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440\nHz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional\n\"knocking\" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased\nsystematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only\ntrials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3,\nrespectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited\nstronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force\nneeded to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration. These\nresults demonstrate that consumer-grade isometric devices can reliably induce\nand measure graded pseudo-haptic feedback without specialized actuators,\nopening a path toward affordable rehabilitation tools, training simulators and\nassistive interfaces."}
