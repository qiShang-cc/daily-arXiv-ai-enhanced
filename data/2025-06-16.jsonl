We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian\nCram\\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To\nvalidate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations\nand experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D\npoint cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The\nfundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with\npossible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning\npipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing\nchallenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with\noutliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse."}

However, existing methods\ntypically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion\nof multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative\nawareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path\nlength and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related\nto the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of\nthese features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first\nintroduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues\nwithin each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the\nconcatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for\nbehavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are\nfurther divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing\ninformation entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.\nExtensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly\navailable datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of\nour method."}

Accepted paper for conference: Forum Acousticum\n  Euronoise 2025 (fa-euronoise2025)", "summary": "Measuring room impulse responses (RIRs) at multiple spatial points is a\ntime-consuming task, while simulations require detailed knowledge of the room's\nacoustic environment. In prior work, we proposed a method for estimating the\nearly part of RIRs along a linear trajectory in a time-varying acoustic\nscenario involving a static sound source and a microphone moving at constant\nvelocity. This approach relies on measured RIRs at the start and end points of\nthe trajectory and assumes that the time intervals occupied by the direct sound\nand individual reflections along the trajectory are non-overlapping. The\nmethod's applicability is therefore restricted to relatively small areas within\na room, and its performance has yet to be validated with real-world data. In\nthis paper, we propose a practical extension of the method to more realistic\nscenarios by segmenting longer trajectories into smaller linear intervals where\nthe assumptions approximately hold. Applying the method piecewise along these\nsegments extends its applicability to more complex room environments. We\ndemonstrate its effectiveness using the trajectoRIR database, which includes\nmoving microphone recordings and RIR measurements at discrete points along a\ncontrolled L-shaped trajectory in a real room."}

Despite its potential, the advancement of V-ETS\nis hindered by a scarcity of paired EMG-speech data. To address this, we\npropose a novel Confidence-based Multi-Speaker Self-training (CoM2S) approach,\nalong with a newly curated Libri-EMG dataset. This approach leverages synthetic\nEMG data generated by a pre-trained model, followed by a proposed filtering\nmechanism based on phoneme-level confidence to enhance the ETS model through\nthe proposed self-training techniques. Experiments demonstrate our method\nimproves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word\nerror rate, confirming the effectiveness of our CoM2S approach for V-ETS. In\nsupport of future research, we will release the codes and the proposed\nLibri-EMG dataset-an open-access, time-aligned, multi-speaker voiced EMG and\nspeech recordings."}
