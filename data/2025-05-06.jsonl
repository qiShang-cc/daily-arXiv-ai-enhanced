This study focuses on estimating the range\nbetween an acoustic receiver and a transiting ship in an acoustically\nrange-independent shallow water environment. Here, acoustic propagation can be\nmodeled by a set of normal modes that are determined by the shallow water\nwaveguide and seabed characteristics. These modes are dispersive, with phase\nand group velocities varying with frequency, and their interference produces\nstriation patterns that depend on range and frequency in single-hydrophone\nspectrograms. These patterns can often be characterized by the waveguide\ninvariant, a single parameter describing the waveguide's properties. This paper\npresents a statistical waveguide invariant-based range estimation approach\nusing a single hydrophone, leveraging broadband and tonal sounds from a\ntransiting ship.

However, the delay\nsensitivity of these computation-intensive applications, especially in a\nmultidevice ISCC system with limited resources, highlights the urgent need for\nefficient sensing task execution frameworks. To address this, we propose a\nresource-efficient sensing framework in this paper. Different from existing\nsolutions, it features a novel action detection module deployed at each device\nto detect the onset of an action. Only time windows filled with signals of\ninterest are offloaded to the edge server and processed by the edge recognition\nmodule, thus reducing overhead. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze the\nsensing performance of the proposed sensing framework and formulate a sensing\naccuracy maximization problem under power, delay, and resource limitations for\nthe multi-device ISCC system. By decomposing it into two subproblems, we\ndevelop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based distributed\nalgorithm. It alternatively solves a sensing accuracy maximization subproblem\nat each device and employs a closed-form computation resource allocation\nstrategy at the edge server till convergence. Finally, a real-world test is\nconducted using commodity wireless devices to validate the sensing performance\nanalysis. Extensive test results demonstrate that our proposal achieves higher\nsensing accuracy under the limited resource compared to two baselines."}

While prior research has primarily focused on addressing\ncommunication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing\nsafety remains largely ignored. In this paper, a novel threat to the sensing\nsafety of ISAC vehicle networks is studied, whereby a malicious reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise the sensing functionality\nof a roadside unit (RSU). Specifically, a malicious attacker dynamically\nadjusts the phase shifts of an RIS to spoof the sensing outcomes of a vehicular\nuser (VU)'s echo delay, Doppler shift, and angle-of-departure (AoD). To achieve\nspoofing on Doppler shift estimation, a time-varying phase shift design on the\nRIS is proposed. Furthermore, the feasible spoofing frequency set with respect\nto the Doppler shift is analytical derived. Analytical results also demonstrate\nthat the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the AoD can be significantly\nmisled under spoofed Doppler shift estimation. Simulation results validate our\ntheoretical findings, showing that the RIS can induce a spoofed velocity\nestimation from 0.1 m/s to 14.9 m/s for a VU with velocity of 10 m/s, and can\ncause an AoD estimation error of up to 65^{\\circ} with only a 5^{\\circ} beam\nmisalignment."}

Distributed estimation\nresilient to such conditions is the topic of this paper. By representing the\nsensor network as a graph and exploiting its inherent structural properties, we\nintroduce novel techniques that enhance the robustness of distributed\nestimators.
