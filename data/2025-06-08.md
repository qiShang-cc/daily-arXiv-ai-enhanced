Motivation: WiFi家庭监控因其覆盖广且不干扰家庭环境成为传统监控的替代方案，但现有研究在商业部署中存在诸多实际问题需要解决。

Method: 开发并部署了一套大规模WiFi传感系统，针对非人类运动、硬件异质性、多用户环境干扰和边缘设备计算限制等问题提出解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based home monitoring has emerged as a compelling alternative to
traditional camera- and sensor-based solutions, offering wide coverage with
minimal intrusion by leveraging existing wireless infrastructure. This paper
presents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a
large-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million
commodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through
this extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder
the practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets)
frequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous
hardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI)
measurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates
occupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and
limited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these
challenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through
comprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16
scenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy
of 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to
non-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead
by 99.72%. Notably, our system integrates sensing and communication, supporting
simultaneous WiFi sensing and data transmission over home WiFi networks. While
focused on home monitoring, our findings and strategies generalize to various
WiFi sensing applications. By bridging the gaps between theoretical research
and commercial deployment, this work offers practical insights for scaling WiFi
sensing in real-world environments.

### [2] [DAS-MAE: A self-supervised pre-training framework for universal and high-performance representation learning of distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04552)
*Junyi Duan,Jiageng Chen,Zuyuan He*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为DAS-MAE的自监督预训练框架，用于分析分布式光纤声学传感（DAS）信号，取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DAS信号因缺乏直观物理对应和独特的时空耦合特性而难以分析的问题。

Method: 提出自监督预训练框架DAS-MAE，通过掩码重建任务学习信号表示。

Result: 在少样本分类任务中，错误率降至1%，相对改进64.5%；在实际应用中，识别错误率为5.0%，相对改进75.7%。

Conclusion: DAS-MAE能够学习高性能和通用的表示，为分析大量未标记DAS信号提供基础模型。

Abstract: Distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing (DAS) has emerged as a
transformative approach for distributed vibration measurement with high spatial
resolution and long measurement range while maintaining cost-efficiency.
However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal DAS signals present analytical
challenges. The abstract signal morphology lacking intuitive physical
correspondence complicates human interpretation, and its unique
spatial-temporal coupling renders conventional image processing methods
suboptimal. This study investigates spatial-temporal characteristics and
proposes a self-supervised pre-training framework that learns signals'
representations through a mask-reconstruction task. This framework is named the
DAS Masked AutoEncoder (DAS-MAE). The DAS-MAE learns high-level representations
(e.g., event class) without using labels. It achieves up to 1% error and 64.5%
relative improvement (RI) over the semi-supervised baseline in few-shot
classification tasks. In a practical external damage prevention application,
DAS-MAE attains a 5.0% recognition error, marking a 75.7% RI over supervised
training from scratch. These results demonstrate the high-performance and
universal representations learned by the DAS-MAE framework, highlighting its
potential as a foundation model for analyzing massive unlabeled DAS signals.

### [3] [Spectral Efficiency Maximization for mmWave MIMO-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Under Practical Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04683)
*Jitendra Singh,Anand Mehrotra,Suraj Srivastava,Aditya K. Jagannatham,Lajos Hanzo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合发射预编码器（TPC）和接收组合器（RC）的设计，用于毫米波（mmWave）多输入多输出（MIMO）集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统。设计以最大化通信用户（CUs）的总频谱效率（SE）为目标，同时满足雷达波束图相似性（RBPS）、总发射功率和恒定模约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决毫米波MIMO ISAC系统中实际应用中的波束图误差和性能优化问题，本文提出了一种兼顾通信和感知性能的混合设计方法。

Method: 采用顺序设计方法，先设计TPC再设计RC。对于TPC设计，提出了基于MM的Riemannian共轭梯度（RCG）方法处理非凸约束；RC设计则采用低复杂度的LMBC方案。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的混合TPC和RC设计在毫米波MIMO ISAC系统中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本文方法在满足雷达和通信性能约束的同时，显著提升了系统性能，为毫米波MIMO ISAC系统的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A hybrid transmit precoder (TPC) and receive combiner (RC) pair is conceived
for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The proposed design considers a
practical mean squared error (MSE) constraint between the desired and the
achieved beampatterns constructed for identifying radar targets (RTs). To
achieve optimal performance, we formulate an optimization problem relying on
sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization of the communication users (CUs),
while satisfying certain radar beampattern similarity (RBPS), total transmit
power, and constant modulus constraints, where the latter are attributed to the
hybrid mmWave MIMO architecture. Since the aforementioned problem is non-convex
and intractable, a sequential approach is proposed wherein the TPCs are
designed first, followed by the RCs. To deal with the non-convex MSE and
constant modulus constraints in the TPC design problem, we propose a
majorization and minimization (MM) based Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG)
method, which restricts the tolerable MSE of the beampattern to within a
predefined limit. Moreover, the least squares and the zero-forcing methods are
adopted for maximizing the sum-SE and for mitigating the multiuser interference
(MUI), respectively. Furthermore, to design the RC at each CU, we propose a
linear MM-based blind combiner (LMBC) scheme that does not rely on the
knowledge of the TPC at the CUs and has a low complexity. To achieve user
fairness, we further extend the proposed sequential approach for maximizing the
geometric mean (GM) of the CU's rate. Simulation results are presented, which
show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid TPC and RC in comparison
to the state-of-the-art designs in the mmWave MIMO ISAC systems under
consideration.

### [4] [Design of OTFS Signals with Pulse Shaping and Window Function for OTFS-Based Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04861)
*Liangchen Sun,Yutaka Jitsumatsu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于广义根升余弦窗口的脉冲雷达系统，通过允许窗口值超出[0,1]范围，增强信号设计灵活性，并结合OTFS信号实现高精度时延和多普勒频移估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统雷达系统中信号设计受限于窗口值范围的问题，同时提高对分数延迟和多普勒频移的估计精度。

Method: 采用广义根升余弦窗口设计，结合矩形脉冲生成OTFS信号，并利用频域插值方法优化参数估计。

Result: 新系统在模糊函数中实现了时延和多普勒域的高集中性，且频域插值方法优于传统线性插值。

Conclusion: 广义RRC窗口和OTFS信号的结合显著提升了雷达系统的灵活性和参数估计精度。

Abstract: We propose a pulse radar system that employs a generalized window function
derived from the root raised cosine (RRC), which relaxes the conventional
constraint that the window values are within the range [0, 1]. The proposed
window allows both negative values and values exceeding 1, enabling greater
flexibility in signal design. The system transmits orthogonal time frequency
space (OTFS) signals intermittently, establishing a flexible input-output
relationship that captures both fractional delays and Doppler shifts. By
combining the generalized RRC window with a rectangular pulse, the resulting
pilot signal achieves a sharp concentration in the ambiguity function over both
the delay and Doppler domains. To enhance the estimation accuracy of fractional
parameters, we apply frequency-domain interpolation based on the
autocorrelation of the RRC window, which outperforms conventional linear
interpolation by preserving the signal structure more effectively.

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著提升低分辨率转换器下大规模MIMO系统的性能，为6G及未来的无线通信系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: To leverage high-frequency bands in 6G wireless systems and beyond, employing
massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) arrays at the transmitter and/or
receiver side is crucial. To mitigate the power consumption and hardware
complexity across massive frequency bands and antenna arrays, a sacrifice in
the resolution of the data converters will be inevitable. In this paper, we
consider a point-to-point massive MIMO system with 1-bit digital-to-analog
converters at the transmitter, where the linearly precoded signal is
supplemented with dithering before the 1-bit quantization. For this system, we
propose a new maximumlikelihood (ML) data detection method at the receiver by
deriving the mean and covariance matrix of the received signal, where
symbol-dependent linear minimum mean squared error estimation is utilized to
efficiently linearize the transmitted signal. Numerical results show that the
proposed ML method can provide gains of more than two orders of magnitude in
terms of symbol error rate over conventional data detection based on soft
estimation.

Abstract: Flexible and intelligent antenna designs, such as pinching antenna systems
and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), have gained extensive research
attention due to their potential to enhance the wireless channels. This letter,
for the first time, presents a comparative study between the emerging pinching
antenna systems and RIS in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. Our results reveal
that RIS requires an extremely large number of elements (in the order of
$10^4$) to outperform pinching antenna systems in terms of spectral efficiency,
which severely impact the energy efficiency performance of RIS. Moreover,
pinching antenna systems demonstrate greater robustness against hardware
impairments and severe path loss typically encountered in high-frequency mmWave

### [8] [An SCMA Receiver for 6G NTN based on Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05111)
*Bruno De Filippo,Carla Amatetti,Riccardo Campana,Alessandro Guidotti,Alessandro Vanelli-Coralli*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 未来6G网络将结合地面与非地面网络（NTN）提供无处不在的连接，并通过边缘计算和分布式学习支持低延迟服务。非正交多址技术（SCMA）带来干扰问题，AI技术被用于优化SCMA接收器，实验表明其性能优于传统方法，但卫星上的实现复杂度仍需解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决6G网络中非正交多址技术（SCMA）带来的干扰问题，提升网络性能。

Method: 采用AI模型（多任务学习）优化SCMA接收器，分离和接收重叠信号，并通过链路级仿真评估性能（BLER和吞吐量）。

Result: AI模型在Eb/N0比基准算法低3.5dB时达到10% BLER目标，吞吐量表现更优。

Conclusion: AI模型在6G NTN中表现优于传统方法，但需解决低轨卫星上的实现复杂度。

Abstract: Future 6G networks are envisioned to enhance the user experience in a
multitude of different ways. The unification of existing terrestrial networks
with non-terrestrial network (NTN) components will provide users with
ubiquitous connectivity. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) will enable
low-latency services, with computations performed closer to the end users, and
distributed learning paradigms. Advanced multiple access schemes, such as
sparse code multiple access (SCMA), can be employed to efficiently move data
from edge nodes to spaceborne MEC servers. However, the non-orthogonal nature
of SCMA results in interference, limiting the effectiveness of traditional SCMA
receivers. Hence, NTN links should be protected with robust channel codes,
significantly reducing the uplink throughput. Thus, we investigate the
application of artificial intelligence (AI) to SCMA receivers for 6G NTNs. We
train an AI model with multi-task learning to optimally separate and receive
superimposed SCMA signals. Through link level simulations, we evaluate the
block error rate (BLER) and the aggregated theoretical throughput achieved by
the AI model as a function of the received energy per bit over noise power
spectral density ratio (Eb/N0). We show that the proposed receiver achieves a
target 10% BLER with 3.5dB lower Eb/N0 with respect to the benchmark algorithm.
We conclude the assessment discussing the complexity-related challenges to the
implementation of the AI model on board of a low earth orbit satellite.

Abstract: Wearable and implantable healthcare sensors are pivotal for real-time patient
monitoring but face critical challenges in power efficiency, data security, and
signal noise. This paper introduces a novel platform that leverages hardware
noise as a dual-purpose resource to enhance machine learning (ML) robustness
and secure data via Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). By integrating
noise-driven signal processing, PUFbased authentication, and ML-based anomaly
detection, our system achieves secure, low-power monitoring for devices like
ECG wearables. Simulations demonstrate that noise improves ML accuracy by 8%
(92% for detecting premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and atrial
fibrillation (AF)), while PUFs provide 98% uniqueness for tamper-resistant
security, all within a 50 uW power budget. This unified approach not only
addresses power, security, and noise challenges but also enables scalable,
intelligent sensing for telemedicine and IoT applications.

Conclusion: GS-based GNN在多小区无线网络优化中表现优异，解决了现有方法无法精确处理整数关联的限制。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models can effectively optimize a multi-cell wireless
network by designing the beamforming vectors and association decisions.
Existing ML designs, however, often needs to approximate the integer
association variables with a probability distribution output. We propose a
novel graph neural network (GNN) structure that jointly optimize beamforming
vectors and user association while guaranteeing association output as integers.
The integer association constraints are satisfied using the Gumbel-Softmax (GS)
reparameterization, without increasing computational complexity. Simulation
results demonstrate that our proposed GS-based GNN consistently achieves
integer association decisions and yields a higher sum-rate, especially when
generalized to larger networks, compared to all other fractional association

### [11] [Polarized 6D Movable Antenna for Wireless Communication: Channel Modeling and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04471)
*Xiaodan Shao,Qijun Jiang,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Naofal Al-Dhahir*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的极化六维可移动天线（P-6DMA），通过电调极化和机械旋转天线优化无线通信性能，并提出了一种低复杂度的联合设计算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了经济高效地提升无线通信性能，探索天线极化和空间多样性的联合利用。

Method: 首先建模P-6DMA信道，提出两阶段传输协议：基于统计CSI优化天线旋转，根据瞬时CSI设计极化向量；采用惩罚对偶分解算法联合优化。

Result: 仿真结果表明，联合设计的极化与天线旋转方案显著优于不带极化和旋转的基准方案。

Conclusion: P-6DMA通过极化和旋转的联合设计，为多用户系统提供了高性能的通信解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel polarized six-dimensional movable antenna
(P-6DMA) to enhance the performance of wireless communication cost-effectively.
Specifically, the P-6DMA enables polarforming by adaptively tuning the
antenna's polarization electrically as well as controls the antenna's rotation
mechanically, thereby exploiting both polarization and spatial diversity to
reconfigure wireless channels for improving communication performance. First,
we model the P-6DMA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming
vectors and antenna rotations. We then propose a new two-timescale transmission
protocol to maximize the weighted sum-rate for a P-6DMA-enhanced multiuser
system. Specifically, antenna rotations at the base station (BS) are first
optimized based on the statistical channel state information (CSI) of all
users, which varies at a much slower rate compared to their instantaneous CSI.
Then, transceiver polarforming vectors are designed to cater to the
instantaneous CSI under the optimized BS antennas' rotations. Under the
polarforming phase shift and amplitude constraints, a new polarforming and
rotation joint design problem is efficiently addressed by a low-complexity
algorithm based on penalty dual decomposition, where the polarforming
coefficients are updated in parallel to reduce computational time. Simulation
results demonstrate the significant performance advantages of polarforming,
antenna rotation, and their joint design in comparison with various benchmarks
without polarforming or antenna rotation adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统资源分配方法基于期望效用理论，但实际代理的偏好可能偏离该理论，需要考虑风险感知、损失厌恶等人类决策特点。

Method: 开发了一个综合分析框架，结合了累积前景理论，以捕捉人类决策中的风险选择和概率度量扭曲。

Result: 框架在多通道无线通信系统中展示了其适用性，特别是功率分配问题。

Conclusion: 研究为具有复杂偏好的代理提供了资源分配的新思路，扩展了传统设计原则。

Abstract: We introduce a resource allocation framework for goal-oriented semantic
networks, where participating agents assess system quality through subjective
(e.g., context-dependent) perceptions. To accommodate this, our model accounts
for agents whose preferences deviate from traditional expected utility theory
(EUT), specifically incorporating cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences.
We develop a comprehensive analytical framework that captures human-centric
aspects of decision-making and risky choices under uncertainty, such as risk
perception, loss aversion, and perceptual distortions in probability metrics.
By identifying essential modifications in traditional resource allocation
design principles required for agents with CPT preferences, we showcase the
framework's relevance through its application to the problem of power
allocation in multi-channel wireless communication systems.

Conclusion: 该算法框架在理论和实践上均有效，适用于复杂的语义通信场景。

Abstract: The problem of resource allocation in goal-oriented semantic communication
with semantic-aware utilities and subjective risk perception is studied here.
By linking information importance to risk aversion, we model agent behavior
using Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), which incorporates risk-sensitive
utility functions and nonlinear transformations of distributions, reflecting
subjective perceptions of gains and losses. The objective is to maximize the
aggregate utility across multiple CPT-modeled agents, which leads to a
nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problem. To efficiently solve this
challenging problem, we propose a new algorithmic framework that combines
successive convex approximation (SCA) with the projected subgradient method and
Lagrangian relaxation, Our approach enables tractable optimization while
preserving solution quality, offering both theoretical rigor and practical
effectiveness in semantics-aware resource allocation.

Abstract: Natural language processing techniques, such as Word2Vec, have demonstrated
exceptional capabilities in capturing semantic and syntactic relationships of
text through vector embeddings. Inspired by this technique, we propose CSI2Vec,
a self-supervised framework for generating universal and robust channel state
information (CSI) representations tailored to CSI-based positioning (POS) and
channel charting (CC). CSI2Vec learns compact vector embeddings across various
wireless scenarios, capturing spatial relationships between user equipment
positions without relying on CSI reconstruction or ground-truth position
information. We implement CSI2Vec as a neural network that is trained across
various deployment setups (i.e., the spatial arrangement of radio equipment and
scatterers) and radio setups (RSs) (i.e., the specific hardware used), ensuring
robustness to aspects such as differences in the environment, the number of
used antennas, or allocated set of subcarriers. CSI2Vec abstracts the RS by
generating compact vector embeddings that capture essential spatial
information, avoiding the need for full CSI transmission or reconstruction
while also reducing complexity and improving processing efficiency of
downstream tasks. Simulations with ray-tracing and real-world CSI datasets
demonstrate CSI2Vec's effectiveness in maintaining excellent POS and CC
performance while reducing computational demands and storage.

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Abstract: Indoor environments present a significant challenge for wireless
connectivity, as immense data demand strains traditional solutions. Public
Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), utilizing outdoor macro base stations (BSs),
suffer from poor signal penetration. Indoor Wi-Fi networks, on the other hand,
may face reliability issues due to spectrum contention. Shared spectrum models,
particularly the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) utilized by private
4G/5G networks, have emerged as a promising alternative to provide reliable
indoor service. Moreover, these private networks are equipped with the
neutral-host (NH) model, seamlessly offloading indoor MNOs' traffic to the
private CBRS network. This paper presents a comprehensive, in-situ performance
evaluation of three co-located technologies utilizing mid-bands spectrum (1-6
GHz)--a CBRS-based NH network, public MNO macro networks, and a Wi-Fi 6
network--within a large, big-box retail store characterized by significant
building loss. Our analysis demonstrates: (i) the NH network provides superior
indoor coverage compared to MNO macro, requiring only six CBRS devices
(CBSDs)--versus 65 Access Points (APs) for enterprise Wi-Fi--to achieve full
coverage, with a median building loss of 26.6 dB ensuring interference-free
coexistence with outdoor federal incumbents; (ii) the NH network achieves
substantial indoor throughput gains, with per-channel normalized throughput
improvements of 1.44x and 1.62x in downlink (DL), and 4.33x and 13x in uplink
(UL), compared to 4G and 5G macro deployments, respectively; (iii) the NH
deployment achieves a median indoor aggregated physical (PHY)-layer DL
throughput gain of 2.08x over 5G macro deployments indoors, despite utilizing
only 40 MHz of aggregated bandwidth compared to 225 MHz for 5G macro; and (iv)
the NH deployment also outperforms Wi-Fi in application-layer HTTP DL
performance by 5.05x.

TL;DR: MARS结合CNN与Transformer，通过多尺度特征融合和残差连接提升无线电地图重构精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法和深度学习方法在无线电地图重构中存在环境感知不足或依赖详细场景数据的局限。

Method: MARS采用多尺度感知特征提取，结合CNN和Transformer，增强全局与局部特征表示。

Result: MARS在多个场景和天线位置实验中，MSE和SSIM表现优于基线模型，计算成本低。

Conclusion: MARS在无线电地图重构中表现出高精度和实用性。

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了非神经网络方法在TWR人类活动识别任务中的可行性，并通过开源代码提供了实现细节。

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Synchro-Thermography的新方法，用于稳定监测面部温度变化与心率变异性的关联，提高了温度分辨率，并验证了其应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外热成像技术在手背等表面血管的非接触测量中表现良好，但面部和颈部等深层血管区域缺乏标准化方法，且外部刺激可能有害。

Method: 采用Synchro-Thermography方法，对八名受试者进行实验，测量前额和下巴区域约10mK的微小温度变化。

Result: 该方法提高了至少2倍的温度分辨率，能稳定测量由血流引起的皮肤温度变化。

Conclusion: 该方法有望应用于生理感知，如血流变化监测或压力指标评估。

Abstract: Infrared thermography has gained interest as a tool for non-contact
measurement of blood circulation and skin blood flow due to cardiac activity.
Partiularly, blood vessels on the surface, such as on the back of the hand, are
suited for visualization. However, standardized methodologies have not yet been
established for areas such as the face and neck, where many blood vessels are
lie deeper beneath the surface, and external stimulation for measurement could
be harmful. Here we propose Synchro-Thermography for stable monitoring of
facial temperature changes associated with heart rate variability. We conducted
experiments with eight subjects and measured minute temperature changes with an
amplitude of about \SI{10}{mK} on the forehead and chin. The proposed method
improves the temperature resolution by a factor of 2 or more, and can stably
measure skin temperature changes caused by blood flow. This skin temperature
change could be applied to physiological sensing such as blood flow changes due
to injury or disease, or as an indicator of stress.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种高效表示和复用阻抗计算的方法，用于解决大型阵列天线几何中的计算问题，显著降低内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阵列天线的几何通常具有有限平移对称性，利用MoM方法计算阻抗矩阵时会产生大量的内存需求，需要一种更高效的计算方法。

Method: 采用多级块Toeplitz矩阵结构，通过九种电连接组件组装阵列，并利用内部求解器加速计算。

Result: 计算了32x32阵列的远场和两个紧密耦合的9x9阵列的散射参数，内存占用从$⁡\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$降至$⁡\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了计算效率和内存利用率，适用于电连接元件的阵列分析。

Abstract: A large part of the geometry of array antennas is often partially defined by
finite translational symmetries. Applying the method of moments (MoM) with the
RWG-like element on an appropriately structured mesh to these arrays results in
an impedance matrix where the main part exhibits a multilevel block Toeplitz
structure. This article introduces a memory-efficient construction method that
effectively represents and reuses impedance calculations. The proposed method,
applicable to electrically connected elements, also accounts for all
non-symmetric parts of the array. The core idea involves nine distinct
electrically connectable components from which the array can be assembled. The
derived multilevel block Toeplitz matrix is further utilized by an in-house
inverse solver to achieve faster and more memory-efficient MoM current vector
calculations. We demonstrate the method by computing the far-field of a 32x32
array and the scattering parameters of two tightly coupled 9x9 arrays. This
approach reduces the memory allocation from $\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$, for an $N_x \times N_y$ array.
