Abstract: The recent surge in deploying extremely large antenna arrays is expected to
play a vital role in future sixth generation wireless networks, enabling
advanced radar target localization with enhanced angular and range resolution.
This paper focuses on the promising technology of Dynamic Metasurface Antennas
(DMAs), integrating numerous sub-wavelength-spaced metamaterials within a
single aperture, and presents a novel framework for designing its analog
reception beamforming weights with the goal to optimize sensing performance
within a spatial Area of Interest (AoI), while simultaneously guaranteeing
desired multi-user uplink communication performance. We derive the Cramer-Rao
Bound (CRB) with DMA-based reception for both passive and active radar targets
lying inside the AoI, which is then used as the optimization objective for
configuring the discrete tunable phases of the metamaterials. Capitalizing on
the DMA partially-connected architecture, we formulate the design problem as
convex optimization and present both direct CRB minimization approaches and low
complexity alternatives using a lower-bound approximation. Simulation results
across various scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework,
showing it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (HRISs) constitute a new paradigm
that redefines smart metasurfaces, not only offering tunable reflections of
incoming signals, but also incorporating signal reception and processing
capabilities. In this paper, leveraging the simultaneous dual-functionality of
HRISs, we propose a novel framework for tracking-aided multi-user
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications. In particular, a joint
design of the transmit multi-user precoding matrix together with the HRIS
reflection and analog combining configurations is presented, with the objective
to maximize the accuracy of position estimation of multiple mobile users while
meeting their individual quality-of-service constraints for sensing-aided

derived together with a prediction approach based on the extended Kalman
filter. Our simulation results showcase the efficacy of the proposed Integrated
Sensing And Communications (ISAC) framework over various system configuration
parameters.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于广义复指数基扩展模型（GCE-BEM）的低复杂度信道估计方案，用于双选信道下的仿频分复用（AFDM）系统，有效降低了计算复杂度并缓解了多普勒干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决双选信道中的分数多普勒色散问题，并降低传统搜索方法的高计算复杂度，作者提出了基于GCE-BEM的信道估计方案。

Method: 采用GCE-BEM建模信道，推导最小均方误差（MMSE）估计的闭式表达式，并通过MMSE检测分析信道估计对误码率（BER）的影响。

Conclusion: 基于GCE-BEM的信道估计方案在降低复杂度和抑制干扰方面具有优越性，理论性能与实验验证一致。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation scheme of
affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) based on generalized complex
exponential basis expansion model (GCE-BEM) over doubly selective channels. The
GCE-BEM is used to solve fractional Doppler dispersion while significantly
reducing the computational complexity of exhaustive search. Then, the
closed-form expression of channel estimation error is derived for the minimum
mean square error (MMSE) estimation algorithm. Based on the estimated channel,
the MMSE detection is adopt to characterize the impacts of estimated channel on
bit error rate (BER) by deriving the theoretical lower bound. Finally,
numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively mitigates
severe inter-Doppler interference (IDoI). Our theoretical performance an alysis
can perfectly match the Monte-Carlo results, validating the effectiveness of
our proposed channel estimation based on GCE-BEM.

### [4] [Two-Agent DRL for Power Allocation and IRS Orientation in Dynamic NOMA-based OWC Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18937)
*Ahrar N. Hamad,Ahmad Adnan Qidan,Taisir E. H. El-Gorashi,Jaafar M. H. Elmirghani*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 动态智能反射面（IRS）辅助的非正交多址（NOMA）可见光通信（VLC）系统通过双智能体深度强化学习（DRL）优化功率分配和IRS角度，显著提升系统性能和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对VLC系统的视距（LoS）阻塞问题，结合IRS和NOMA技术以提高覆盖率和总速率，但传统优化方法无法实时解决非凸问题。

Method: 提出双智能体DRL算法，基于集中训练与分散执行的框架，动态优化功率分配和IRS角度。

Result: 所提算法在动态环境中表现优于标准DRL算法，且性能优于无IRS或IRS随机部署的系统。

Conclusion: 动态IRS辅助的NOMA-VLC系统通过DRL实现了高效实时的资源分配，显著提升能源效率和用户公平性。

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) technology has been considered a
promising solution in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to its
potential to overcome the line-of-sight (LoS) blockage issue and enhance
coverage. Moreover, integrating IRS with a downlink non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) transmission technique for multi-users is a smart solution to
achieve a high sum rate and improve system performance. In this paper, a
dynamic IRS-assisted NOMA-VLC system is modeled, and an optimization problem is
formulated to maximize sum energy efficiency (SEE) and fairness among multiple
mobile users under power allocation and IRS mirror orientation constraints. Due
to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the non-linearity of
the constraints, conventional optimization methods are impractical for
real-time solutions. Therefore, a two-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm is designed for optimizing power allocation and IRS orientation based
on centralized training with decentralized execution to obtain fast and
real-time solutions in dynamic environments. The results show the superior
performance of the proposed DRL algorithm compared to standard DRL algorithms
typically used for resource allocation in wireless communication. The results
also show that the proposed DRL algorithm achieves higher performance compared
to deployments without IRS and with randomly oriented IRS elements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在未来6G网络中，ISAC通过共享频谱和硬件资源同时提供通信与感知服务，OFDM作为主流波形仍需深入研究其潜力与挑战。

Conclusion: MIMO-OFDM ISAC具备潜力，但仍需解决开放挑战，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is one of the key usage scenarios
for future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks, where
communication and sensing (C&S) services are simultaneously provided through
shared wireless spectrum, signal processing modules, hardware, and network
infrastructure. Such an integration is strengthened by the technology trends in
6G, such as denser network nodes, larger antenna arrays, wider bandwidths,
higher frequency bands, and more efficient utilization of spectrum and hardware
resources, which incentivize and empower enhanced sensing capabilities. As the
dominant waveform used in contemporary communication systems, orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is still expected to be a very
competitive technology for 6G, rendering it necessary to thoroughly investigate
the potential and challenges of OFDM ISAC. Thus, this paper aims to provide a
comprehensive tutorial overview of ISAC systems enabled by large-scale
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and OFDM technologies and to discuss their
fundamental principles, advantages, and enabling signal processing methods. To
this end, a unified MIMO-OFDM ISAC system model is first introduced, followed
by four frameworks for estimating parameters across the spatial, delay, and
Doppler domains, including parallel one-domain, sequential one-domain, joint
two-domain, and joint three-domain parameter estimation. Next, sensing
algorithms and performance analyses are presented in detail for far-field
scenarios where uniform plane wave (UPW) propagation is valid, followed by
their extensions to near-field scenarios where uniform spherical wave (USW)
characteristics need to be considered. Finally, this paper points out open
challenges and outlines promising avenues for future research on MIMO-OFDM
ISAC.

Conclusion: 提出的多级架构方案有效降低了CSVACs的功率耗散，为晶体管放大器的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: As transistor sizes reach the mesoscopic scale, the limitations of
traditional methods in ensuring thermodynamic consistency have made power
dissipation optimization in transistor amplifiers a critical challenge. Based
on stochastic thermodynamics, a transistor voltage amplifier model is first
proposed as a new insight to investigate nonlinear relationships between the
power dissipation and voltage gain for complementary symmetric voltage
amplifier circuits (CSVACs). Utilizing the proposed model, the phenomenon,
i.e., the power dissipation exponentially increases with the increase of
voltage gain in CSVACs, is first clarified by an analytical expression to
quantify the impact of voltage gain and input signal amplitude on the power
dissipation. Considering the characteristic of power dissipation, a new
multistage architecture is proposed to reduce the power dissipation in CSVACs.
To optimize the power dissipation by adjusting the number of stages and the
voltage gain at each stage, an optimal multistage scheme is proposed for
multistage CSVACs. Simulation and experimental results show up to 99.36% and
94.59% power dissipation reduction compared with traditional CSVACs by the
proposed optimal multistage scheme, respectively.

### [7] [ODE-Former for Mobile Channel Prediction: A Novel Learning Structure Leveraging The Physics Continuity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19122)
*Zhuoran Xiao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经常微分方程（NODE）的新型学习结构，用于准确和灵活地预测无线信道状态信息（CSI），解决了传统方法在高天线规模和高用户移动性下的信号开销大和信道老化问题。


<details>

Abstract: Obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI) is crucial and challenging
for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. With
the increasing antenna scale and user mobility, traditional channel estimation
approaches suffer greatly from high signaling overhead and channel aging
problems. By exploring the intrinsic correlation among a set of historical CSI
instances, channel prediction is proven to increase the CSI accuracy while
lowering the signaling overhead significantly. Existing works view this problem
as a regular discrete sequence prediction task while ignoring the unique
physics property of wireless channels. This letter proposes a novel former-like
learning structure based on neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs)
inclusively designed for accurate and flexible channel prediction. The proposed
network aims to represent wireless channels' implicit physics spatial-temporal
continuity by integrating the Neural ODE into a former-like learning structure.
Our proposed method impeccably fits channel matrices' mathematics features and
enjoys solid network interpretability. Experimental results show that the
proposed learning approach outperforms existing methods from the perspective of
accuracy, flexibility, and robustness.

### [8] [Coherent Source Enumeration with Compact ULAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19126)
*Dibakar Sil,Sunder Ram Krishnan,Kumar Vijay Mishra*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了TARgEt方法，通过分解前向-后向平滑协方差矩阵为秩约束的Toeplitz矩阵和对角矩阵，解决小均匀线性阵列中相干源导致的信号和噪声子空间模糊问题，并通过ADMM求解非凸优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小均匀线性阵列中相干源引起的信号和噪声子空间模糊问题，现有方法未有效处理此类情况。

Method: 将前向-后向平滑协方差矩阵分解为秩约束的Toeplitz矩阵（信号子空间）和非负对角矩阵（噪声子空间），采用ADMM求解非凸优化问题。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了TARgEt方法的有效性和鲁棒性，优于现有的子空间匹配和协方差矩阵重构方法。

Conclusion: TARgEt方法在小均匀线性阵列中有效解决了相干源导致的子空间模糊问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Source enumeration typically relies on subspace-based techniques that require
accurate separation of signal and noise subspaces. However, prior works do not
address coherent sources in small uniform linear arrays, where ambiguities
arise in the spatial spectrum. We address this by decomposing the
forward-backward smoothed covariance matrix into a sum of a rank-constrained
Toeplitz matrix and a diagonal matrix with non-negative entries representing
the signal and noise subspace, respectively. We solve the resulting non-convex
optimization problem by proposing Toeplitz approach for rank-based target
estimation (TARgEt) that employs the alternating direction method of
multipliers. Numerical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TARgEt over a recent subspace
matching method and a related covariance matrix reconstruction approach.

Abstract: Trust region optimization-based received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
interference source localization methods have been widely used in low-altitude
research. However, these methods often converge to local optima in complex
environments, degrading the positioning performance. This paper presents a
novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided progressive interference source
localization method based on improved trust region optimization. By combining
the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm with particle swarm optimization (PSO),
our proposed method can effectively enhance the success rate of localization.
We also propose a confidence quantification approach based on the UAV-to-ground
channel model. This approach considers the surrounding environmental
information of the sampling points and dynamically adjusts the weight of the
sampling data during the data fusion. As a result, the overall positioning
accuracy can be significantly improved. Experimental results demonstrate the
proposed method can achieve high-precision interference source localization in
noisy and interference-prone environments.

Conclusion: 基于元学习的SFANC系统显著提升了动态噪声环境下的性能，验证了其在实际工业应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The selective fixed-filter strategy is popular in industrial applications
involving active noise control (ANC) technology, which circumvents the
time-consuming online learning process by selecting the best-matched
pre-trained control filter. However, the existing selective fixed-filter ANC
(SFANC) based algorithms classify noises in frequency band, which is not a
reasonable approach. Moreover, they pre-train the control filter utilizing only
a single noise segment, leading to inaccurate estimation and undesirable noise
cancellation performance when dealing with dynamically time-varying noise.
Inspired by the applicability of meta-learning to various models utilizing
gradient descent technique, this paper proposes a novel meta-learning based
SFANC system, wherein the fixed-filters that may not be optimal for specific
types of noises but can rapidly adapt to previously unseen noise conditions are
pre-trained. To address the mismatch issue between meta-learning update methods
and ANC requirements while enhancing the receptive field and convergence speed
of control filters, a multiple-input batch processing strategy is utilized in
pre-training. Simulations based on the common ESC-50 noise dataset are
performed and demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed method in terms of
classification accuracy, convergence speed, and steady-state noise
cancellation.

Conclusion: 提出的设计指南为LIS在6G技术中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: A large intelligent surface (LIS) is a promising approach to enhancing 6G
performance in sub-10 GHz frequency bands. An analysis of the horizontal dipole
linear array reveals that when the array size is sufficiently large, employing
the conjugate phase method to excite the antenna elements results in a focal
point along the central line of the array that gradually stabilizes at a
constant value. The study evaluates the 3dB focal resolution generated by the
dipole array for two polarizations. Additionally, the feasibility of generating
circularly polarized focal points and the focal displacement under a limited
array size are explored. Previous near-field focal synthesis methods primarily
considered only the line-of-sight (LOS) channel. To enhance practicality, this
study adopts a two-ray channel model to analyze near-field focal synthesis
results in the presence of a reflected path. Both two polarizations are
discussed separately, with design guidelines provided for array placement and
focal point positioning. Finally, electromagnetic simulations are conducted
within the linear array to validate the proposed design. These simulations
highlight the capability of the horizontal dipole array configuration to be
directly applied without significant coupling effects between elements. The
proposed design guidelines lay a solid foundation for the application of LIS in
6G technology.

Conclusion: 通过分离收发阵列的方位操作并采用NAF采样，本文方法为未来双稳态ISAC部署提供了高效的采样策略，显著提升性能。

Abstract: A key challenge in future 6G Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC)
networks is to define the angular operations of transmitter and receiver, i.e.,
the sampling task of the angular domains, to acquire information about the
environment. In this work we extend previous analysis for optimal angular
sampling of monostatic setups to two-dimensional bistatic deployments, that are
as important as the former in future ISAC cellular scenarios. Our approach
overcomes the limitations of suboptimal prior art sampling and interpolation
techniques, such as spline interpolation. We demonstrate that separating
azimuth operations of the two transmit and receive arrays is optimal to sample
the angular domain in an array-specific normalized angular frequency (NAF).
This allows us to derive a loss-less reconstruction of the angular domain,
enabling a more efficient and accurate sampling strategy for bistatic sensing
applications compared to legacy approaches. As demonstrated by different Monte
Carlo experiments, our approach enables future bistatic ISAC deployments with
better performance compared to the other suboptimal solutions.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) poses various challenges that
arise from the communication-centric design of cellular networks. One of them
is target detection with time division duplex (TDD) transmission used in
current 5G and future 6G deployments, where the periodic on-off behavior of the
transmitter creates impulsive sidelobes in the radar point spread function
(PSF). These can be mistaken for actual targets by conventional peak detection
techniques, leading to false alarms. In this work, we first analytically
describe the range-Doppler PSF due to TDD windowing. We then propose a
computationally efficient method that leverages the PSF to distinguish
impulsive sidelobes from valid target peaks. Simulation results and outdoor
drone measurements with an ISAC proof of concept demonstrate the capability of
our algorithm, showing that it can achieve reliable target detection while
limiting false alarms.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a super-resolution wideband beam training method
for near-field communications, which is able to achieve ultra-low overhead. To
this end, we first study the multi-beam characteristic of a sparse uniform
linear array (S-ULA) in the wideband. Interestingly, we show that this leads to
a new beam pattern property, called rainbow blocks, where the S-ULA generates
multiple grating lobes and each grating lobe is further splitted into multiple
versions in the wideband due to the well-known beam-split effect. As such, one
directional beamformer based on S-ULA is capable of generating multiple rainbow
blocks in the wideband, hence significantly extending the beam coverage. Then,
by exploiting the beam-split effect in both the frequency and spatial domains,
we propose a new three-stage wideband beam training method for extremely
large-scale array (XL-array) systems. Specifically, we first sparsely activate
a set of antennas at the central of the XL-array and judiciously design the
time-delay (TD) parameters to estimate candidate user angles by comparing the
received signal powers at the user over subcarriers. Next, to resolve the
angular ambiguity introduced by the S-ULA, we activate all antennas in the
central subarray and design an efficient subcarrier selection scheme to
estimate the true user angle. In the third stage, we resolve the user range at
the estimated user angle with high resolution by controlling the splitted beams
over subcarriers to simultaneously cover the range domain. Finally, numerical
results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed wideband beam
training scheme, which only needs three pilots in near-field beam training,
while achieving near-optimal rate performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of a multi-reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted fluid antenna system (FAS). In this system, a
single-antenna transmitter communicates with a receiver equipped with a planar
FAS through multiple RISs in the absence of a direct link. To enhance the
system performance, we propose two novel selection schemes: \textit{Max-Max}
and \textit{Max-Sum}. In particular, the \textit{Max-Max} scheme selects the
best combination of a single RIS and a single fluid antenna (FA) port that
offers the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. On the other
hand, the \textit{Max-Sum} scheme selects one RIS while activating all FA ports
providing the highest overall SNR. We conduct a detailed performance analysis
of the proposed system under Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. First, we derive the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the SNR for both selection schemes.
The derived CDF is then used to obtain approximate theoretical expressions for
the outage probability (OP) and the delay outage rate (DOR). Next, a high-SNR
asymptotic analysis is carried out to provide further insights into the system
performance in terms of diversity and coding gains. Finally, the analytical
results are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating
their accuracy and providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's
performance.

this paper, we propose a model-based deep neural network (MB-DNN), which
leverages permutation equivalent properties and the optimal beamforming
structure to jointly optimize the holographic and digital beamforming.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MB-DNN outperforms benchmark

Abstract: In this paper, we study the deployment optimization for an extremely
large-scale intelligent reflecting surface (XL-IRS) assisted multi-user
communication system, within which the channels between the XL-IRS and the BS
(or user) are modeled by the near-field spherical wavefronts. To draw some
valuable insights, we first consider the single-user case, where an alternating
optimization (AO) based algorithm is devised to maximize the received
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the user. To address the high computational
complexity issue incurred by the AO based algorithm, three approximate received
SNR expressions are obtained to yield useful insights, corresponding to the
upper bound, approximate expression, and closed-form. It is demonstrated that
the XL-IRS ought to be positioned near the user (rather than the BS) to obtain
a higher beamforming gain. Then, for the multi-user scenario, an efficient
algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality XL-IRS placement solution by
using the AO and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Furthermore,
the effective degree of freedom (DoF) of the BS-IRS channel is provided, which
indicates that the additional effective DoF can be leveraged to improve
multi-user spatial multiplexing. Last, numerical results confirm the existence
of a trade-off between near-field beam-focusing gain and multiplexing gain.

Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a promising
technology to improve the spectrum efficiency and spatial resolution of future
wireless systems. Different from existing works that mostly considered physical
layer security (PLS) in either the far-field or near-field, we consider in this
paper a new and practical scenario, where legitimate users (Bobs) are located
in the far-field of a base station (BS) while eavesdroppers (Eves) are located
in the near-field for intercepting confidential information at short distance,
referred to as the mixed near-field and far-field PLS. Specifically, we
formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-secrecy-rate of all Bobs
by optimizing the power allocation of the BS, subject to the constraint on the
total BS transmit power. To shed useful insights, we first consider a
one-Bob-one-Eve system and characterize the insecure-transmission region of the
Bob in closed form. Interestingly, we show that the insecure-transmission
region is significantly \emph{expanded} as compared to that in conventional
far-field PLS systems, due to the energy-spread effect in the mixed-field
scenario. Then, we further extend the analysis to a two-Bob-one-Eve system. It
is revealed that as compared to the one-Bob system, the interferences from the
other Bob can be effectively used to weaken the capability of Eve for
intercepting signals of target Bobs, thus leading to enhanced secrecy rates.
Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality
solution to the formulated non-convex problem by leveraging the successive
convex approximation (SCA) technique. Finally, numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed algorithm achieves a higher sum-secrecy-rate than the
benchmark scheme where the power allocation is designed based on the
(simplified) far-field channel model.

Abstract: Token communication (TC) is poised to play a pivotal role in emerging
language-driven applications such as AI-generated content (AIGC) and wireless
language models (LLMs). However, token loss caused by channel noise can
severely degrade task performance. To address this, in this article, we focus
on the problem of semantics-aware packetization and develop a novel algorithm,
termed semantic packet aggregation with genetic beam search (SemPA-GBeam),
which aims to maximize the average token similarity (ATS) over erasure
channels. Inspired from the genetic algorithm (GA) and the beam search
algorithm, SemPA-GBeam iteratively optimizes token grouping for packetization
within a fixed number of groups (i.e., fixed beam width in beam search) while
randomly swapping a fraction of tokens (i.e., mutation in GA). Experiments on
the MS-COCO dataset demonstrate that SemPA-GBeam achieves ATS and LPIPS scores
comparable to exhaustive search while reducing complexity by more than 20x.

Conclusion: PhysioOmni为多模态生理信号分析提供了一种通用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial
for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on
specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle
to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle
missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose
PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis
that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal
signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility
with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal
tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and
modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete
modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning
with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four
downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor
prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing
modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.

Conclusion: 该低复杂度算法为STAR-RIS的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future
wireless communication systems. However, the conventional RIS can only reflect
the incident signal. Hence, it provides a limited coverage, as compared to a
simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS). Prior works on the
STAR-RIS address the power minimisation or the sum-rate maximisation problem by
reformulating the objective problem as a convex optimisation problem and then
employing numerical tools like CVX to obtain the solution, which introduces
significant computational complexity leading to a huge runtime, making the
algorithms impractical for real-world implementation. In this paper, we propose
a low complexity solution for the optimisation of a multi-user STAR-RIS system,
where the non-convex optimisation problem is decomposed into multiple convex
sub-problems with closed-form optimal solutions. The simulation results
illustrate that our proposed algorithm achieves similar performance to
CVX-based solutions in the literature while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: 有损BD-RIS模型的提出及优化算法验证了其实际应用潜力，且最优架构需根据损耗情况动态调整。

Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as an
advancement and generalization of the conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) by
introducing tunable interconnections between RIS elements, enabling smarter
wave manipulation and enlarged coverage. While BD-RIS has demonstrated
advantages over D-RIS in various aspects, most existing works rely on the
assumption of a lossless model, leaving practical considerations unaddressed.
This paper thus proposes a lossy BD-RIS model and develops corresponding
optimization algorithms for various BD-RIS-aided communication systems. First,
by leveraging admittance parameter analysis, we model each tunable admittance
based on a lumped circuit with losses and derive an expression of a circle
characterizing the real and imaginary parts of each tunable admittance. We then
consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input
single-output (SISO) systems with the proposed lossy BD-RIS model. To solve the
optimization problem, we design an effective algorithm by carefully exploiting
the problem structure. Specifically, an alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) framework is custom-designed to deal with the complicated
constraints associated with lossy BD-RIS. Furthermore, we extend the proposed
algorithmic framework to more general multiuser multiple-input single-output
(MU-MISO) systems, where the transmit precoder and BD-RIS scattering matrix are
jointly designed to maximize the sum-rate of the system. Finally, simulation
results demonstrate that all BD-RIS architectures still outperform D-RIS in the
presence of losses, but the optimal BD-RIS architectures in the lossless case
are not necessarily optimal in the lossy case, e.g. group-connected BD-RIS can
outperform fully- and tree-connected BD-RISs in SISO systems with relatively
high losses, whereas the opposite always holds true in the lossless case.

The experimental work reported here examines full right ascension coverage at

interferometer space delay aliasing were observed. A phase noise test,
celestial source identification methods and associated measurements were used

Result: 复杂度从O(NM×M!)降至O(NM)，与常规对角RIS的LS估计相当。

Conclusion: 所提协议显著降低计算负载，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Non-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) offer enhanced
wireless signal manipulation over conventional RIS by enabling the incident
signal on any of its $M$ elements to be reflected from another element via an
$M \times M$ switch array. To fully exploit this flexible configuration, the
acquisition of individual channel state information (CSI) is essential.
However, due to the passive nature of the RIS, cascaded channel estimation is
performed, as the RIS itself lacks signal processing capabilities. This entails
estimating the CSI for all $M \times M$ switch array permutations, resulting in
a total of $M!$ possible configurations, to identify the optimal one that
maximizes the channel gain. This process leads to long uplink training
intervals, which degrade spectral efficiency and increase uplink energy
consumption. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation
protocol that substantially reduces the need for exhaustive $M!$ permutations
by utilizing only three configurations to optimize the non-diagonal RIS switch
array and beamforming for single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input
single-output (MISO) systems. Specifically, our three-stage pilot-based
protocol estimates scaled versions of the user-RIS and RIS-base-station (BS)
channels in the first two stages using the least square (LS) estimator and the
commonly used ON/OFF protocol from conventional RIS. In the third stage, the
cascaded user-RIS-BS channels are estimated to enable efficient beamforming
optimization. Complexity analysis shows that our proposed protocol
significantly reduces the BS computational load from $\mathcal{O}(NM\times M!)$
to $\mathcal{O}(NM)$, where $N$ is the number of BS antennas. This complexity
is similar to the conventional ON/OFF-based LS estimation for conventional
diagonal RIS.

Conclusion: SemanticBC-TriRL通过分层交替学习有效解决多任务冲突，为语义通信提供可扩展的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic broadcast communications (Semantic BC) for image transmission have
achieved significant performance gains for single-task scenarios. Nevertheless,
extending these methods to multi-task scenarios remains challenging, as
different tasks typically require distinct objective functions, leading to
potential conflicts within the shared encoder. In this paper, we propose a
tri-level reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-task Semantic BC framework,
termed SemanticBC-TriRL, which effectively resolves such conflicts and enables
the simultaneous support of multiple downstream tasks at the receiver side,
including image classification and content reconstruction tasks. Specifically,
the proposed framework employs a bottom-up tri-level alternating learning
strategy, formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. At
the first level, task-specific decoders are locally optimized using supervised
learning. At the second level, the shared encoder is updated via proximal
policy optimization (PPO), guided by task-oriented rewards. At the third level,
a multi-gradient aggregation-based task weighting module adaptively adjusts
task priorities and steers the encoder optimization. Through this hierarchical
learning process, the encoder and decoders are alternately trained, and the
three levels are cohesively integrated via constrained learning objective.
Besides, the convergence of SemanticBC-TriRL is also theoretically established.
Extensive simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed framework across diverse channel conditions, particularly in low SNR
regimes, and confirm its scalability with increasing numbers of receivers.

### [29] [Graph Reinforcement Learning for QoS-Aware Load Balancing in Open Radio Access Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19499)
*Omid Semiari,Hosein Nikopour,Shilpa Talwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图强化学习（GRL）的QoS感知负载均衡方法，用于优化多频段O-RAN中GBR和BE流量的性能，相比基线方法显著降低了QoS违规并提升了BE流量的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代无线网络需要满足严格的QoS要求，而小区拥塞是实现这一目标的主要挑战。如何在不同QoS需求的流量中动态分配资源成为了关键问题。

Method: 提出了一种结合图神经网络（GNN）和强化学习（RL）的GRL框架，将负载均衡建模为马尔可夫决策过程，并使用GNN架构的DQN进行训练。

Result: 与基线方法相比，该方案将QoS违规减少了53%，BE流量的5th百分位速率提升了四倍。

Conclusion: GRL框架能够有效解决多频段O-RAN中的负载均衡问题，显著提升网络性能，同时适应不同网络规模和动态需求。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless cellular networks are expected to provide
unparalleled Quality-of-Service (QoS) for emerging wireless applications,
necessitating strict performance guarantees, e.g., in terms of link-level data
rates. A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention
of cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient
radio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User
Equipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach
is developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best
Effort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS
and resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement
Learning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural
Network (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process,
with states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both
state representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained
using an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based
architecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of
nodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of
accounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the
GRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show
substantial performance gains, including a $53\%$ reduction in QoS violations
and a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了非学习迭代优化器对对抗性示例的敏感性，揭示了其与机器学习模型相似的脆弱性，并通过对抗训练提升了鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索非学习决策规则（尤其是迭代优化器）是否与机器学习模型一样容易受到对抗性攻击的影响。

Method: 方法包括将迭代优化器视为机器学习模型进行分析，展示其对对抗性示例的敏感性，并通过对抗训练增强鲁棒性。

Result: 结果表明，迭代优化器确实存在对抗性脆弱性，且通过展开和对抗训练可以有效提升其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，非学习迭代优化器与机器学习模型在对抗性敏感性上具有共性，对抗训练是提升其鲁棒性的有效手段。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are often sensitive to carefully crafted yet
seemingly unnoticeable perturbations. Such adversarial examples are considered
to be a property of ML models, often associated with their black-box operation
and sensitivity to features learned from data. This work examines the
adversarial sensitivity of non-learned decision rules, and particularly of
iterative optimizers. Our analysis is inspired by the recent developments in
deep unfolding, which cast such optimizers as ML models. We show that
non-learned iterative optimizers share the sensitivity to adversarial examples
of ML models, and that attacking iterative optimizers effectively alters the
optimization objective surface in a manner that modifies the minima sought. We
then leverage the ability to cast iteration-limited optimizers as ML models to
enhance robustness via adversarial training. For a class of proximal gradient
optimizers, we rigorously prove how their learning affects adversarial
sensitivity. We numerically back our findings, showing the vulnerability of
various optimizers, as well as the robustness induced by unfolding and
adversarial training.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Transformer的深度学习方法，用于高精度、实时的天气短临预报，采用轴向注意力机制处理时间序列数据，并在指标上达到先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报模型在处理局部风暴或小时尺度天气事件时存在局限性，计算成本高且不够实时。本研究旨在利用深度学习技术替代现有系统，实现高精度、低延迟的短临预报。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的机器学习模型（UNet+轴向注意力机制），通过处理时间序列帧学习复杂天气动态模式，适用于单变量、多变量及嵌入时间序列数据。

Result: 在下一代帧预测数据集上取得最优指标（PSNR=47.67，SSIM=0.9943），验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的Transformer框架为天气短临预报提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，其低推理成本和高分辨率特性具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Making accurate weather predictions can be particularly challenging for
localized storms or events that evolve on hourly timescales, such as
thunderstorms. Hence, our goal for the project was to model Weather Nowcasting
for making highly localized and accurate predictions that apply to the
immediate future replacing the current numerical weather models and data
assimilation systems with Deep Learning approaches. A significant advantage of
machine learning is that inference is computationally cheap given an
already-trained model, allowing forecasts that are nearly instantaneous and in
the native high resolution of the input data. In this work we developed a novel
method that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast
precipitation. This approach works by leveraging axial attention mechanisms to
learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series frames. Moreover, it is a
generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series
data, as well as time series embeddings data. This paper represents an initial
research on the dataset used in the domain of next frame prediciton, and hence,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art results in terms of metrices (PSNR = 47.67,
SSIM = 0.9943) used for the given dataset using UNet with Axial Transformer.

### [32] [Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion via Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19530)
*Yicheng Li,Xinghua Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Burer-Monteiro分解的梯度型算法（APGD），用于解决欧氏距离矩阵补全（EDMC）问题。该算法在无样本分割的情况下，证明了全局收敛和精确恢复的理论保证，并通过数值实验展示了其性能与理论预测的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EDMC问题，特别是在部分欧氏距离测量下恢复点集配置，同时避免使用复杂的局部曲率和切线空间RIP条件。

Method: 采用非对称投影梯度下降（APGD）算法，基于Burer-Monteiro分解，并通过新的上界替换随机图引理来分析收敛性。

Result: 在样本充足区域，APGD表现出精确的线性收敛行为；但在样本有限时，其性能显著下降，与标准非凸方法（s-stress）相比有一定差距。

Conclusion: APGD虽在理论上匹配预测，但可能因隐式正则化能力受限或新梯度方向需要更多样本而表现不稳定，暗示其样本需求高于信息理论极限。

Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a gradient-type algorithm based on
Burer-Monteiro factorization, called the Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent
(APGD), for reconstructing the point set configuration from partial Euclidean
distance measurements, known as the Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion (EDMC)
problem. By paralleling the incoherence matrix completion framework, we show
for the first time that global convergence guarantee with exact recovery of
this routine can be established given $\mathcal{O}(\mu^2 r^3 \kappa^2 n \log
n)$ Bernoulli random observations without any sample splitting. Unlike
leveraging the tangent space Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and local
curvature of the low-rank embedding manifold in some very recent works, our
proof provides new upper bounds to replace the random graph lemma under EDMC
setting. The APGD works surprisingly well and numerical experiments demonstrate
exact linear convergence behavior in rich-sample regions yet deteriorates fast
when compared with the performance obtained by optimizing the s-stress
function, i.e., the standard but unexplained non-convex approach for EDMC, if
the sample size is limited. While virtually matching our theoretical
prediction, this unusual phenomenon might indicate that: (i) the power of
implicit regularization is weakened when specified in the APGD case; (ii) the
stabilization of such new gradient direction requires substantially more
samples than the information-theoretic limit would suggest.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) in Federated Learning (FL), showing KAN outperforms traditional MLP in blood cell classification with simpler structures. It also analyzes hyperparameter impacts and optimizes KAN architecture for FL, suggesting KAN as a viable option for privacy-preserving medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore KAN's potential in FL for healthcare, where preserving data privacy is critical, and compare its performance with traditional MLP in a medical imaging task.

Method: Benchmarked KAN against MLP across six FL algorithms on a blood cell dataset, studied hyperparameters (grid size, architecture), and conducted ablation tests on KAN's width and depth.

Result: KAN achieved superior performance with simpler architectures than MLP in FL, with optimized width and minimal depth yielding the best results.

Conclusion: KAN is a promising alternative to MLP in FL for medical imaging, offering better performance and simpler structures while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across decentralized devices
without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy in sensitive domains like
healthcare. In this paper, we evaluate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)
architectures against traditional MLP across six state-of-the-art FL algorithms
on a blood cell classification dataset. Notably, our experiments demonstrate
that KAN can effectively replace MLP in federated environments, achieving
superior performance with simpler architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters-grid size and network architecture-on KAN
performance under varying degrees of Non-IID data distribution. Additionally,
our ablation studies reveal that optimizing KAN width while maintaining minimal
depth yields the best performance in federated settings. As a result, these
findings establish KAN as a promising alternative for privacy-preserving
medical imaging applications in distributed healthcare. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark of KAN in FL settings for
medical imaging task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种非凸优化方法用于低阶线性系统辨识：Burer-Monterio因式分解和直接系统参数优化，以提高计算效率并降低统计误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Hankel秩最小化方法依赖凸松弛，计算成本高且需多次SVD分解，因此希望通过非凸优化改进计算效率。

Method: 使用Burer-Monterio因式分解优化Hankel矩阵的核范数，以及直接优化可对角化系统的参数，避免频繁SVD计算。

Result: 非凸方法显著降低计算成本，减少统计误差和样本复杂度，且在多项式时间内保证全局最优。

Conclusion: 所提方法在合成数据上验证了理论优势，为非凸优化在系统辨识中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-order linear System IDentification (SysID) addresses the challenge of
estimating the parameters of a linear dynamical system from finite samples of
observations and control inputs with minimal state representation. Traditional
approaches often utilize Hankel-rank minimization, which relies on convex
relaxations that can require numerous, costly singular value decompositions
(SVDs) to optimize. In this work, we propose two nonconvex reformulations to
tackle low-order SysID (i) Burer-Monterio (BM) factorization of the Hankel
matrix for efficient nuclear norm minimization, and (ii) optimizing directly
over system parameters for real, diagonalizable systems with an atomic norm
style decomposition. These reformulations circumvent the need for repeated
heavy SVD computations, significantly improving computational efficiency.
Moreover, we prove that optimizing directly over the system parameters yields
lower statistical error rates, and lower sample complexities that do not scale
linearly with trajectory length like in Hankel-nuclear norm minimization.
Additionally, while our proposed formulations are nonconvex, we provide
theoretical guarantees of achieving global optimality in polynomial time.
Finally, we demonstrate algorithms that solve these nonconvex programs and
validate our theoretical claims on synthetic data.

Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication toward next-generation networks
introduces unprecedented demands on data rates, latency, and connectivity. To
meet these requirements, two key trends have emerged: the use of higher
communication frequencies to provide broader bandwidth, and the deployment of
massive multiple-input multiple-output systems with large antenna arrays to
compensate for propagation losses and enhance spatial multiplexing. These
advancements significantly extend the Rayleigh distance, enabling near-field
(NF) propagation alongside the traditional far-field (FF) regime. As user
communication distances dynamically span both FF and NF regions, cross-field
(CF) communication has also emerged as a practical consideration. Beam
management (BM)-including beam scanning, channel state information estimation,
beamforming, and beam tracking-plays a central role in maintaining reliable
directional communications. While most existing BM techniques are developed for
FF channels, recent works begin to address the unique characteristics of NF and
CF regimes. This survey presents a comprehensive review of BM techniques from
the perspective of propagation fields. We begin by building the basic through
analyzing the modeling of FF, NF, and CF channels, along with the associated
beam patterns for alignment. Then, we categorize BM techniques by
methodologies, and discuss their operational differences across propagation
regimes, highlighting how field-dependent channel characteristics influence
design tradeoffs and implementation complexity. In addition, for each BM
method, we identify open challenges and future research directions, including
extending FF methods to NF or CF scenarios, developing unified BM strategies
for field-agnostic deployment, and designing low-overhead BM solutions for
dynamic environments.

Motivation: 研究Zak-OTFS调制中DD域的I/O关系和噪声协方差，以提升性能评估和收发器算法开发的效率。

Method: 通过推导闭式表达式，分析了三种接收滤波器配置（相同滤波、匹配滤波、信道匹配滤波）的I/O关系和噪声协方差。

Result: 结果显示，信道匹配滤波性能最佳，匹配滤波与相同滤波性能相近。

Conclusion: 闭式表达式为Zak-OTFS的性能分析和算法设计提供了有效工具，信道匹配滤波是实现最佳性能的关键。

Abstract: The transceiver operations in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain in Zak-OTFS
modulation, including DD domain filtering at the transmitter and receiver,
involve twisted convolution operation. The twisted convolution operations give
rise to multiple integrals in the end-to-end DD domain input-output (I/O)
relation. The I/O relation plays a crucial role in performance evaluation and
algorithm development for transceiver implementation. In this paper, we derive
discrete DD domain closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise
covariance in Zak-OTFS. We derive these expressions for sinc and Gaussian pulse
shaping DD filters at the transmitter (Tx). On the receiver (Rx) side, three
types of DD filters are considered, viz., $(i)$ Rx filter identical to Tx
filter (referred to as `identical filtering'), $(ii)$ Rx filter matched to the
Tx filter (referred to as `matched filtering'), and $(iii)$ Rx filter matched
to both Tx filter and channel response (referred to as `channel matched
filtering'). For all the above cases, except for the case of sinc identical
filtering, we derive exact I/O relation and noise covariance expressions in
closed-form. For the sinc identical filtering case, we derive approximate
closed-form expressions which are shown to be accurate. Using the derived
closed-form expressions, we evaluate the bit error performance of Zak-OTFS for
different Tx/Rx filter configurations. Our results using Vehicular-A (Veh-A)
channel model with fractional DDs show that, while matched filtering achieves
slightly better or almost same performance as identical filtering, channel
matched filtering achieves the best performance among the three.

Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers offer a quantum-native alternative to conventional
RF front-ends by directly detecting electromagnetic fields via highly excited
atomic states. While their quantum-limited sensitivity and hardware simplicity
make them promising for future wireless systems, extending their use to
scalable multi-antenna and multi-carrier configurations, termed Scalable
Atomic-MIMO (SA-MIMO), remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a
novel RF transmitter-atomic receiver architecture that addresses this gap. The
core idea lies in a novel modulation technique called Phase-Rotated Symbol
Spreading (PRSS), which transforms the nonlinear phase retrieval problem
inherent to atomic detection into a tractable linear demultiplexing task. PRSS
enables efficient signal processing and supports scalable MUX/DeMUX operations
in both atomic MIMO and atomic OFDM systems. Simulation results show that the
proposed system achieves up to 2.5 dB gain under optimal maximum-likelihood
detection and over 10 dB under suboptimal detection in MIMO settings. These
results establish PRSS assisted SA-MIMO as a promising architecture for
realizing high-sensitivity, interference-resilient atomic wireless
communication.

Motivation: 现有研究多采用理想化的即时生成模型（GAW），忽略了状态更新数据包生成的随机性。本文旨在通过更实际的模型填补这一空白。

Method: 建立了严格的解析框架，评估NOMA在有无重传情况下的平均AoI表现，并研究了传输概率对AoI的影响。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) to grant-free transmissions to reduce the age of information (AoI) in
uplink status update systems, where multiple sources upload their {status
updates} to {a common} receiver. Unlike existing studies which {adopted} the
idealized generate-at-will (GAW) model, {i.e., a status} update data can be
generated and transmitted at any time, this paper utilizes a more practical
model {to characterize} the inherent randomness of the generation of the status
updating data packets. A rigorous analytical framework is established to
precisely evaluate the average AoI achieved by the NOMA-assisted grant-free
schemes for both {the} cases with and without retransmission. The impact of the
choice of the probability {of transmission} on the average AoI is investigated.
Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the accuracy of the
developed analysis. It is shown that NOMA-assisted schemes are more superior in
reducing AoI{, compared} to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based schemes. In
addition, compared to schemes without retransmission, the AoI performance {of}
the schemes with retransmission can {be improved} significantly when the status
update generation rate is low or the user density is relatively high.
