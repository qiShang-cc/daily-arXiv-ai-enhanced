### [1] [Integrated Image Reconstruction and Target Recognition based on Deep Learning Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04836)
*Cien Zhang,Jiaming Zhang,Jiajun He,Okan Yurduseven*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出Att-ClassiGAN，一种结合注意力机制的深度学习模型，用于计算微波成像(CMI)中的图像重建和目标分类，显著提升了性能和效率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CMI方法存在计算瓶颈，尤其是图像重建阶段耗时较长。为解决这一问题，作者提出在ClassiGAN基础上引入注意力机制，以提高特征提取和目标分类的准确性。

Method: 研究在ClassiGAN模型中加入了注意力门模块（attention gate modules），动态聚焦重要特征并抑制无关信息，从而优化特征提取和分类性能。

Result: Att-ClassiGAN相比传统CMI方法显著缩短了重建时间，在NMSE、SSIM和分类结果上均优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入注意力机制，Att-ClassiGAN在计算微波成像中实现了高效且高精度的图像重建与分类，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Computational microwave imaging (CMI) has gained attention as an alternative
technique for conventional microwave imaging techniques, addressing their
limitations such as hardware-intensive physical layer and slow data collection
acquisition speed to name a few. Despite these advantages, CMI still encounters
notable computational bottlenecks, especially during the image reconstruction
stage. In this setting, both image recovery and object classification present
significant processing demands. To address these challenges, our previous work
introduced ClassiGAN, which is a generative deep learning model designed to
simultaneously reconstruct images and classify targets using only
back-scattered signals. In this study, we build upon that framework by
incorporating attention gate modules into ClassiGAN. These modules are intended
to refine feature extraction and improve the identification of relevant
information. By dynamically focusing on important features and suppressing
irrelevant ones, the attention mechanism enhances the overall model
performance. The proposed architecture, named Att-ClassiGAN, significantly
reduces the reconstruction time compared to traditional CMI approaches.
Furthermore, it outperforms current advanced methods, delivering improved
Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), higher Structural Similarity Index
(SSIM), and better classification outcomes for the reconstructed targets.

### [3] [Over-the-Air ODE-Inspired Neural Network for Dual Task-Oriented Semantic Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04970)

Conclusion: Air-ODE网络通过模拟计算和RIS技术显著提升了频谱效率和任务性能，证明了其在语义通信中的潜力。

Abstract: Analog machine-learning hardware platforms promise greater speed and energy
efficiency than their digital counterparts. Specifically, over-the-air analog
computation allows offloading computation to the wireless propagation through
carefully constructed transmitted signals. In addition, reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) is emerging as a promising solution for
next-generation wireless networks, offering the ability to tailor the
communication environment. Leveraging the advantages of RIS, we design and
implement the ordinary differential equation (ODE) neural network using
over-the-air computation (AirComp) and demonstrate its effectiveness for dual
tasks. We engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment through
distributed RISs to create an architecture termed the over-the-air ordinary
differential equation (Air-ODE) network. Unlike the conventional digital
ODE-inspired neural network, the Air-ODE block utilizes the physics of wave
reflection and the reconfigurable phase shifts of RISs to implement an ODE
block in the analog domain, enhancing spectrum efficiency. Moreover, the
advantages of Air-ODE are demonstrated in a deep learning-based semantic
communication (DeepSC) system by extracting effective semantic information to
reduce the data transmission load, while achieving the dual functions of image
reconstruction and semantic tagging simultaneously at the receiver. Simulation
results show that the analog Air-ODE network can achieve similar performance to
the digital ODE-inspired network. Specifically, for the image reconstruction
and semantic tagging task, compared with the analog network without the Air-ODE
block, the Air-ODE block can achieve around 2 times gain in both reconstruction
quality and tagging accuracy.

### [4] [Experiment Study on Reference-Path-Aided System Calibration for mmWave Bistatic ISAC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05003)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于参考路径的系统校准方案，用于解决毫米波双基地ISAC系统中的同步问题，通过补偿系统误差显著提升了感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双基地ISAC可以消除自干扰并兼容现有网络基础设施，但同步问题导致感知性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用毫米波ISAC系统中的延迟-角度稀疏特性，识别参考路径（LoS或NLoS），并利用其信道参数补偿所有路径的系统误差。

Result: 实验证明，该方案支持精确的多普勒频移和延迟估计，时间同步误差控制在1纳秒内。

Conclusion: 所提出的校准方案有效解决了双基地ISAC的同步问题，显著提升了感知性能。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been regarded as a key
enabling technology for next-generation wireless networks. Compared to
monostatic ISAC, bistatic ISAC can eliminate the critical challenge of
self-interference cancellation and is well compatible with the existing network
infrastructures. However, the synchronization between the transmitter and the
sensing receiver becomes a crucial problem. The extracted channel state
information (CSI) for sensing under communication synchronization contains
different types of system errors, such as the sampling time offset (STO),
carrier frequency offset (CFO), and random phase shift, which can severely
degrade sensing performance or even render sensing infeasible. To address this
problem, a reference-path-aided system calibration scheme is designed for
mmWave bistatic ISAC systems, where the line-of-sight (LoS) path can be
blocked. By exploiting the delay-angle sparsity feature in mmWave ISAC systems,
the reference path, which can be either a LoS or a non-LoS (NLoS) path, is
first identified. By leveraging the fact that all the paths suffer the same
system errors, the channel parameter extracted from the reference path is
utilized to compensate for the system errors in all other paths. A mmWave ISAC
system is developed to validate our design. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed scheme can support precise estimation of Doppler shift and
delay, maintaining time-synchronization errors within 1 nanosecond.

committed is presented, and the work is complemented with extensive synthetic

Abstract: Multi-frequency massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication is a
promising strategy for both 5G and future 6G systems, ensuring reliable
transmission while enhancing frequency resource utilization. Statistical
channel state information (CSI) has been widely adopted in multi-frequency
massive MIMO transmissions to reduce overhead and improve transmission
performance. In this paper, we propose efficient and accurate methods for
obtaining statistical CSI in multi-frequency massive MIMO systems. First, we
introduce a multi-frequency massive MIMO channel model and analyze the mapping
relationship between two types of statistical CSI, namely the angular power
spectrum (APS) and the spatial covariance matrix, along with their correlation
across different frequency bands. Next, we propose an autoregressive (AR)
method to predict the spatial covariance matrix of any frequency band based on
that of another frequency band. Furthermore, we emphasize that channels across
different frequency bands share similar APS characteristics. Leveraging the
maximum entropy (ME) criterion, we develop a low-complexity algorithm for
high-resolution APS estimation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
of the AR-based covariance prediction method and demonstrate the
high-resolution estimation capability of the ME-based approach. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-frequency cooperative transmission by
applying the proposed methods to obtain statistical CSI from low-frequency
bands and utilizing it for high-frequency channel transmission. This approach
significantly enhances high-frequency transmission performance while
effectively reducing system overhead.

Abstract: Sustainable energy supply and high-speed communications are two significant
needs for mobile electronic devices. This paper introduces a self-aligning
resonant beam system for simultaneous light information and power transfer
(SLIPT), employing a novel coupled spatially distributed resonator (CSDR). The
system utilizes a resonant beam for efficient power delivery and a
second-harmonic beam for concurrent data transmission, inherently minimizing
echo interference and enabling bidirectional communication. Through
comprehensive analyses, we investigate the CSDR's stable region, beam
evolution, and power characteristics in relation to working distance and device
parameters. Numerical simulations validate the CSDR-SLIPT system's feasibility
by identifying a stable beam waist location for achieving accurate mode-match
coupling between two spatially distributed resonant cavities and demonstrating
its operational range and efficient power delivery across varying distances.
The research reveals the system's benefits in terms of both safety and energy
transmission efficiency. We also demonstrate the trade-off among the
reflectivities of the cavity mirrors in the CSDR. These findings offer valuable
design insights for resonant beam systems, advancing SLIPT with significant
potential for remote device connectivity.

### [8] [Temperature-Resilient LC-RIS Phase-Shift Design for Multi-user Downlink Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05160)
*Nairy Moghadas Gholian,Mohamadreza Delbari,Vahid Jamali,Arash Asadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了温度对基于液晶的可重构智能表面(LC-RIS)性能的影响，并提出了一种温度弹性相移设计，优化了多用户毫米波网络的信干噪比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于半导体的可重构智能表面(RIS)功耗和成本高，尤其是在毫米波/亚太赫兹频段。液晶(LC)技术的应用有望降低这些成本，但LC对温度敏感，影响了其可靠性。

Method: 论文提出了一种温度弹性的相移设计，并通过最大-最小信干噪比优化方法，考虑温度对LC-RIS相位偏移的影响。

Result: 模拟结果显示，相比于忽略温度影响的基线方法，所提算法在参数集上表现显著改善。

Conclusion: 研究为LC-RIS在温度变化环境中的应用提供了有效解决方案，优化了其性能表现。

Abstract: The reflecting antenna elements in most reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs) use semiconductor-based (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes
and varactors) phase shifters. Although effective, a drawback of this
technology is the high power consumption and cost, which become particularly
prohibitive in millimeter-wave (mmWave)/sub-Terahertz range. With the advances
in Liquid Crystals (LCs) in microwave engineering, we have observed a new trend
in using LC for realizing phase shifter networks of RISs. LC-RISs are expected
to significantly reduce the fabrication costs and power consumption. However,
the nematic LC molecules are sensitive to temperature variations. Therefore,
implementing LC-RIS in geographical regions with varying temperatures requires
temperature-resilient designs. The mentioned temperature variation issue
becomes more significant at higher temperatures as the phase shifter range
reduces in warmer conditions, whereas it expands in cooler ones. In this paper,
we study the impact of temperature on the operation of LC-RISs and develop a
temperature-resilient phase shift design. Specifically, we formulate a max-min
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio optimization for a multi-user downlink
mmWave network that accounts for the impact of temperature in the LC-RIS phase
shifts. The simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement for the
considered set of parameters when using our algorithm compared to the baseline
approach, which neglects the temperature effects.

### [9] [From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated Sleep Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05371)
*Niklas Grieger,Siamak Mehrkanoon,Philipp Ritter,Stephan Bialonski*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化睡眠分析方法，结合了睡眠分期和纺锤波检测模型，验证了其在大规模睡眠研究中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化的睡眠分析可以解决大规模研究中的时间和评分者间差异问题，但目前多步骤分析的可行性尚不明确。

Method: 使用RobustSleepNet进行睡眠分期和SUMOv2进行纺锤波检测，对比专家手动分析的结果。

Result: 自动化方法在定性上复现了专家研究的关键发现，但定量结果存在差异，模型表现与评分者间一致性相当或更好。

Conclusion: 全自动化方法有望推动大规模睡眠研究，作者公开了代码并推出了隐私保护的睡眠分析平台SomnoBot。

Abstract: Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages)
and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable
large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater
incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle
detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating
multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully
automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep
staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can
replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The
automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based
study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between
bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously
took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis
differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases
between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually
performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle
detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the
potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public
access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and
introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.

### [10] [Chirp-Based Aliasing Analysis of Arrays in the Spherical Wavefront Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05378)
*Gilles Monnoyer,Laurence Defraigne,Baptiste Sambon,Jérôme Louveaux,Luc Vandendorpe*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于球面波阵面（SWR）的啁啾信号解释，将接收/发射信号的空间频谱与阵列几何结构关联，分析了有限天线数引起的混叠效应对模糊函数的退化，并通过圆阵和均匀线阵实例验证。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统天线阵列的波传播建模通常基于欧几里得原理，而该论文旨在提供一种球面波阵面下的新视角，以更深入理解空间混叠对信号处理的几何影响。

Method: 通过啁啾信号重新解释导向矢量，利用采样定理分析有限天线数导致的混叠效应，并建模其对模糊函数的退化，最终在圆阵和均匀线阵的近场条件下实例化。

Result: 揭示了非空间不变混叠机制的几何本质，为球面波阵面下的信号处理提供了新思路，并通过具体阵列结构验证了方法的普适性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅拓展了球面波阵面下的波传播理论，还为实际天线阵列设计中的混叠效应提供了可解释的几何分析工具。

Abstract: In antenna arrays, wave propagation modeling based on Euclidean principles is
typically represented by steering vectors or signals. This paper provides a
new, chirp-based, interpretation of steering vectors in the Spherical Wavefront
Regime (SWR), establishing a relationship between the spatial spectrum of the
received (resp. transmitted) signal and the geometry of the array and the
source (resp. target). Leveraging the well-known sampling theorem, we analyze
aliasing effects arising from spatial sampling with a finite number of antennas
and understand how these effects degrade the Ambiguity Function (AF). Our
framework provides geometric insight into these degradations, offering a deeper
understanding of the non-space-invariant aliasing mechanisms in the SWR. The
proposed approach is formulated for general antenna arrays and then
instantiated to Circular Array and to Uniform Linear Array structures operating
in Near Field conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ApoE基因变异对呼吸功能的影响，尤其是ApoE4等位基因与神经退行性疾病的关联，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过测量大鼠模型（gene59和gene95）的胸膜腔压力数据（PLETH），分析呼吸波形特征和熵统计。

Result: 两种基因型在活动和休息状态下的呼吸指标及熵值存在显著差异，且深呼吸（sighs）会短暂改变这些指标。

Conclusion: ApoE基因型对呼吸模式有显著影响，深呼吸会进一步调节这些模式，这可能为神经退行性疾病的研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene variations are involved in lipid metabolism and
cholesterol transport, with the ApoE4 allele being a known risk factor
associated with neurodegenerative conditions later in life. Emerging evidence
suggests these genetic variations may also influence respiratory function and
vitality. However, the specific impact of different ApoE genotypes on breathing
patterns remains largely unexplored. This work investigates differences in
breathing waveform characteristics and entropy statistics derived from
plethysmography (PLETH) data between rat models possessing two distinct ApoE
genotypes (referred to herein as gene59 and gene95). Findings reveal
significant distributional differences in common plethysmography metrics and
approximate entropy between the two genotypes, observed during both active and
resting states. Additionally, the study examines the transient impact of sighs
(deep breaths) on these breathing metrics, demonstrating that entropy and other
measures are altered in the breaths immediately following a sigh.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效计算标准离散分数傅里叶变换（MA-DFRFT）的简单方法，基于已有的MA-CDFRFT，并通过形式化对称性减少计算所需的FFT次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MA-CDFRFT虽在时频分析中有用，但局限于中心离散分数傅里叶变换（CDFRFT），而标准DFRFT已被广泛研究，需要将其扩展到标准形式以拓宽应用范围。

Method: 通过简单调整MA-CDFRFT，提出MA-DFRFT，并形式化其对称性以减少计算所需的FFT次数。

Result: 成功实现了标准DFRFT的高效计算，并减少了一半的FFT计算需求，适用于资源受限环境。

Conclusion: MA-DFRFT为资源受限环境中的时频分析提供了一种高效工具，扩展了离散分数傅里叶变换的应用潜力。

Abstract: The efficiently computed multiangle centered discrete fractional Fourier
transform (MA-CDFRFT) [1] has proven as a useful tool for time-frequency
analysis; however, its scope is limited to the centered discrete fractional
Fourier transform (CDFRFT). Meanwhile, extensive research on the standard DFRFT
has lead to a better understanding of this transform as well as numerous
possible choices for eigenvectors for implementation. In this letter we present
a simple adaptation of the MA-CDFRFT which allows us to efficiently compute its
standard counterpart, which we call the multiangle DFRFT (MA-DFRFT).
Furthermore, we formalize the symmetries inherent to the MA-CDFRFT and MA-DFRFT
to halve the number of FFTs needed to compute these transforms, paving the way
for applications in resource constrained environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种高效的混合场广义6DMA THz信道模型和低开销的信道估计算法，解决了THz网络中因6DMA运动范围大导致的远近场问题及信道估计的高计算复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究6DMA增强的THz网络，通过控制天线表面的3D位置和旋转支持多用户，但THz信号的短波长和大范围运动导致远近场问题及信道估计复杂度高。

Method: 提出混合场广义6DMA THz信道模型，结合单个表面内的平面波传播和不同表面间的球面波传播，并设计基于方向稀疏性的低开销信道估计算法。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提模型接近真实近场信道模型的性能和低复杂度的信道估计准确性。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了6DMA THz网络的远近场问题和高复杂度信道估计挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we study a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-enhanced
Terahertz (THz) network that supports a large number of users with a few
antennas by controlling the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations
of antenna surfaces/subarrays at the base station (BS). However, the short
wavelength of THz signals combined with a large 6DMA movement range extends the
near-field region. As a result, a user can be in the far-field region relative
to the antennas on one 6DMA surface, while simultaneously residing in the
near-field region relative to other 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, 6DMA THz channel
estimation suffers from increased computational complexity and pilot overhead
due to uneven power distribution across the large number of candidate
position-rotation pairs, as well as the limited number of radio frequency (RF)
chains in THz bands. To address these issues, we propose an efficient
hybrid-field generalized 6DMA THz channel model, which accounts for planar wave
propagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical waves among different
6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, we propose a low-overhead channel estimation
algorithm that leverages directional sparsity to construct a complete channel
map for all potential antenna position-rotation pairs.
  Numerical results show that the proposed hybrid-field channel model achieves
a sum rate close to that of the ground-truth near-field channel model and
confirm that the channel estimation method yields accurate results with low
complexity.

TL;DR: 论文研究了VLC与RIS的集成如何增强物理层安全，并提出两种框架优化VLC系统的SR和SEE，比较了RSMA与NOMA的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过VLC与RIS的结合，提升信号控制的精确性和动态适应性，从而增强VLC系统的保密性和安全性。

Method: 提出两种框架联合优化功率分配、RIS关联和角度调整，采用遗传算法解决混合整数非线性规划问题。

Result: 模拟显示RSMA方案在SR和SEE指标上优于NOMA，并分析了用户速率要求、RIS元素数量和最大发射功率的影响。

Conclusion: RSMA在安全性和能效上表现更优，为VLC系统的优化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Integrating VLC with the RIS significantly enhances physical layer security
by enabling precise directional signal control and dynamic adaptation to the
communication environment. These capabilities strengthen the confidentiality
and security of VLC systems. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
joint optimization of VLC AP power allocation, RIS association, and RIS
elements orientation angles for secure VLC systems, while considering RSMA and
power-domain NOMA schemes. Specifically, two frameworks are proposed to
maximize both the minimum secrecy rate (SR) and the minimum secrecy energy
efficiency (SEE) by jointly optimizing power allocation, RIS association, and
RIS elements orientation angles for both power-domain NOMA and RSMA-based VLC
systems. The proposed frameworks consider random device orientation and
guarantee the minimum user-rate requirement. The proposed optimization
frameworks belong to the class of mixed integer nonlinear programming, which
has no known feasible solution methodology to guarantee the optimal solution.
Moreover, the increased degree of freedom and flexibility from the joint
consideration of power control, RIS association and element orientation results
in a large set of decision variables and constraints, which further complicates
the optimization problem. To that end, we utilize a genetic algorithm-based
solution method, which through its exploration and exploitation capabilities
can obtain a good quality solution. Additionally, comprehensive simulations
show that the RSMA scheme outperforms the power-domain NOMA scheme across both
the SR and SEE metrics over various network parameters. Furthermore, useful
insights on the impact of minimum user rate requirement, number of RIS

Motivation: 流体天线系统（FAS）在下一代无线系统中提供更强的空间多样性，但由于可重构端口数量多且射频（RF）链有限，准确获取信道状态信息（CSI）仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的基于扩散模型的方法在高维度FAS中实现了高效且精确的信道估计，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer enhanced spatial diversity for
next-generation wireless systems. However, acquiring accurate channel state
information (CSI) remains challenging due to the large number of reconfigurable
ports and the limited availability of radio-frequency (RF) chains --
particularly in high-dimensional FAS scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose an efficient posterior sampling-based channel estimator that leverages
a diffusion model (DM) with a simplified U-Net architecture to capture the
spatial correlation structure of two-dimensional FAS channels. The DM is
initially trained offline in an unsupervised way and then applied online as a
learned implicit prior to reconstruct CSI from partial observations via
posterior sampling through a denoising diffusion restoration model (DDRM). To
accelerate the online inference, we introduce a skipped sampling strategy that
updates only a subset of latent variables during the sampling process, thereby
reducing the computational cost with minimal accuracy degradation. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher
estimation accuracy and over 20x speedup compared to state-of-the-art
compressed sensing-based methods, highlighting its potential for practical
deployment in high-dimensional FAS.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于时频相位偏移导频（TFPSPs）的信道获取方法，用于大规模MIMO-OFDM系统。通过引入三重波束（TB）信道张量模型，设计了TFPSPs，并开发了低复杂度的张量信息几何方法（IGA）进行信道估计。仿真结果表明，该方法显著降低了归一化均方误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模MIMO-OFDM系统中，传统信道估计方法面临高复杂度和导频开销大的问题。为了高效抑制用户间干扰并降低计算复杂度，作者提出了TFPSP方法。

Method: 1. 提出三重波束（TB）信道张量模型；2. 设计时频相位偏移导频（TFPSPs）；3. 开发低复杂度的张量信息几何方法（IGA）进行TB域信道估计。

Result: 仿真显示，该方法在用户数量多的场景下，归一化均方误差（NMSE）降低了8 dB以上，且复杂度低、导频开销小。

Conclusion: 该方法通过TFPSPs和IGA实现了高效信道估计，适用于大规模MIMO-OFDM系统，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a channel acquisition approach with time-frequency
phase-shifted pilots (TFPSPs) for massive multi-input multi-output orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We first present a
triple-beam (TB) based channel tensor model, allowing for the representation of
the space-frequency-time (SFT) domain channel as the product of beam matrices
and the TB domain channel tensor. By leveraging the specific characteristics of
TB domain channels, we develop TFPSPs, where distinct pilot signals are
simultaneously transmitted in the frequency and time domains. Then, we present
the optimal TFPSP design and provide the corresponding pilot scheduling
algorithm. Further, we propose a tensor-based information geometry approach
(IGA) to estimate the TB domain channel tensors. Leveraging the specific
structure of beam matrices and the properties of TFPSPs, we propose a
low-complexity implementation of the tensor-based IGA. We validate the
efficiency of our proposed channel acquisition approach through extensive
simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our
approach. The proposed approach can effectively suppress inter-UT interference
with low complexity and limited pilot overhead, thereby enhancing channel
estimation performance. Particularly in scenarios with a large number of UTs,
the channel acquisition method outperforms existing approaches by reducing the
normalized mean square error (NMSE) by more than 8 dB.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种分散式基带处理（DBP）架构，用于优化流体天线系统（FAS）的位置设计，并提出了基于分块坐标上升（BCA）的新算法，显著降低了计算和通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体天线系统（FAS）因其自由度（DoF）高而在无线通信中具有潜力，但优化其位置的计算成本巨大，尤其在多天线场景下，因此需要一种高效的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过DBP架构将FA阵列分簇并行处理，结合矩阵分数规划和MM方法，提出了一种分散式BCA算法，联合优化波束成形和FA位置设计以最大化加权和速率（WSR）。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该算法在DBP架构下计算时间减少了70%以上，且WSR性能损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 提出的分散式算法有效降低了FAS的计算和通信开销，为大规模FA系统的实际应用提供了可行性。

Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology,
offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) for wireless communication
systems. However, optimizing fluid antenna (FA) positions entails significant
computational costs, especially when the number of FAs is large. To address
this challenge, we introduce a decentralized baseband processing (DBP)
architecture to FAS, which partitions the FA array into clusters and enables
parallel processing. Based on the DBP architecture, we formulate a weighted sum
rate (WSR) maximization problem through joint beamforming and FA position
design for FA-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)
systems. To solve the WSR maximization problem, we propose a novel
decentralized block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based algorithm that leverages
matrix fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods.
The proposed decentralized algorithm achieves low computational, communication,
and storage costs, thus unleashing the potential of the DBP architecture.
Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm under the DBP architecture
reduces computational time by over 70% compared to centralized architectures
with negligible WSR performance loss.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种近场动态混合波束成形架构结合人工噪声，提升了多用户多输入单输出（MU-MISO）场景下的安全传输性能，在角度和距离维度均实现安全传输，性能优于传统远场技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着下一代无线网络中天线孔径和传输频率的增加，近场通信（NFC）的需求日益增长。极大规模天线阵列（ELAA）的应用增强了信道矩阵的空间自由度，为设计安全通信方案提供了新机会。

Method: 提出了一种动态混合波束成形架构，结合人工噪声设计，无需窃听者的信道状态信息（CSI），可有效干扰其通信。分析了动态预编码器在多指标下的性能。

Abstract: The increase in antenna apertures and transmission frequencies in
next-generation wireless networks is catalyzing advancements in near-field
communications (NFC). In this paper, we investigate secure transmission in
near-field multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenarios.
Specifically, with the advent of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA)
applied in the NFC regime, the spatial degrees of freedom in the channel matrix
are significantly enhanced. This creates an expanded null space that can be
exploited for designing secure communication schemes. Motivated by this
observation, we propose a near-field dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture
incorporating artificial noise, which effectively disrupts eavesdroppers at any
undesired positions, even in the absence of their channel state information
(CSI). Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the dynamic precoder's
performance in terms of the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio,
achievable rate, secrecy capacity, secrecy outage probability, and the size of
the secrecy zone. In contrast to far-field secure transmission techniques that
only enhance security in the angular dimension, the proposed algorithm exploits
the unique properties of spherical wave characteristics in NFC to achieve
secure transmission in both the angular and distance dimensions. Remarkably,
the proposed algorithm is applicable to arbitrary modulation types and array
configurations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
approximately 20\% higher rate capacity compared to zero-forcing and the
weighted minimum mean squared error precoders.

TL;DR: 该论文通过分析芬兰奥卢市的天气对Starlink FHP终端性能的影响，发现降雨显著降低了上下行吞吐量，但对往返时间无显著影响；云量覆盖与吞吐量呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Starlink作为全球覆盖的卫星通信解决方案，其FHP终端在极端天气下的性能尚未被详细研究，尤其是在北欧近北极圈地区的实际表现。

Method: 研究在芬兰奥卢市进行，通过测量不同天气条件（降雨、云量覆盖）下的Starlink FHP终端吞吐量和往返时间，并采用线性回归分析云量与吞吐量的关系。

Result: 降雨导致中位上下行吞吐量分别下降52.27%和37.84%，但对往返时间无显著影响；云量覆盖每增加75%（从12.5%到87.5%），吞吐量下降约20%。

Conclusion: 天气条件（尤其是降雨和云量）显著影响Starlink FHP终端的吞吐量，但在延迟方面表现稳定。这为高纬度地区用户提供了关键性能参考。

Abstract: Satellite communications have emerged as one of the most feasible solutions
to provide global wireless coverage and connect the unconnected. Starlink
dominates the market with over 7,000 operational satellites in low Earth orbit
(LEO) and offers global high-speed and low-latency Internet service for
stationary and mobile use cases, including in-motion connectivity for vehicles,
vessels, and aircraft. Starlink terminals are designed to handle extreme
weather conditions. Starlink recommends a flat high performance (FHP) terminal
for users living in areas with extreme weather conditions. The earlier studies
evaluated Starlink's FHP throughput for stationary and in-motion users without
providing a detailed analysis of how weather affects its performance. There
remains a need to investigate the impact of weather on FHP's throughput. In
this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing the impact of weather on
Starlink's performance in Oulu, Finland, a city located in Northern Europe near
the Arctic Circle. Our measurements reveal that rain degrades median uplink and
downlink throughput by 52.27% and 37.84%, respectively. On the contrary, there
was no noticeable impact on the round-trip time. Additionally, we also examine
the impact of cloud cover on the Starlink throughput. The linear regression
analysis reveals the negative relationship between throughput and cloud cover.
The cloud cover of up to 12.5% has around 20% greater throughput than the cloud
cover of 87.5%

Abstract: The sixth generation of wireless networks defined several key performance
indicators (KPIs) for assessing its networks, mainly in terms of reliability,
coverage, and sensing. In this regard, remarkable attention has been paid
recently to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm as an
enabler for efficiently and jointly performing communication and sensing using
the same spectrum and hardware resources. On the other hand, ensuring
communication and data security has been an imperative requirement for wireless
networks throughout their evolution. The physical-layer security (PLS) concept
paved the way to catering to the security needs in wireless networks in a
sustainable way while guaranteeing theoretically secure transmissions,
independently of the computational capacity of adversaries. Therefore, it is of
paramount importance to consider a balanced trade-off between communication
reliability, sensing, and security in future networks, such as the 5G and
beyond, and the 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and system-wise
review of designed secure ISAC systems from a PLS point of view. In particular,
the impact of various physical-layer techniques, schemes, and wireless
technologies to ensure the sensing-security trade-off is studied from the
surveyed work. Furthermore, the amalgamation of PLS and ISAC is analyzed in a
broader impact by considering attacks targeting data confidentiality,
communication covertness, and sensing spoofing. The paper also serves as a
tutorial by presenting several theoretical foundations on ISAC and PLS, which
represent a practical guide for readers to develop novel secure ISAC network
designs.
