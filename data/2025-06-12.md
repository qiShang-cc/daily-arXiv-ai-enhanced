### [1] [Estimating Visceral Adiposity from Wrist-Worn Accelerometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09167)
*James R. Williamson,Andrew Alini,Brian A. Telfer,Adam W. Potter,Karl E. Friedl*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了内脏脂肪组织（VAT）与日常体力活动（PA）的关系，并提出两种方法从活动中估算VAT，结果显示PA与VAT及代谢健康风险密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内脏脂肪组织（VAT）是代谢健康和日常体力活动的关键指标，过量VAT与2型糖尿病和胰岛素抵抗高度相关。研究旨在探讨如何从PA中准确估算VAT。

Method: 使用2011-2014年NHANES数据，采用两种方法估算VAT：一是基于步态和睡眠的工程特征和岭回归，二是基于24小时连续加速度计的深度神经网络和Transformer模型。

Result: 结合两种方法并提供人口统计学和身体测量信息时，VAT估算相关性最高（r=0.86），表明PA与VAT及代谢健康风险存在强关联。

Conclusion: 研究证实了PA与VAT及代谢健康风险的紧密关系，为通过PA监测VAT提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and
habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2
diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology
relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile
fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during
exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can
also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for
individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men;
2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity.
The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep,
and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a
VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours
of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame
into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each
day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over
multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained
with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body
measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two
approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These
findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by
extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.

Method: 使用电路模型设计传输Wiener滤波器解决方案，分析三种多天线架构的能源效率。

Result: 动态超表面天线在多种场景下表现优于传统阵列，尤其是低传输功率和强耦合情况下。

Conclusion: 动态超表面天线是实现绿色通信的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Motivated by the stringent and challenging need for `greener communications'
in increasingly power-hungry 5G networks, this paper presents a detailed energy
efficiency analysis for three different multi-antenna architectures, namely
fully-digital arrays, hybrid arrays, and dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs).
By leveraging a circuital model, which captures mutual coupling, insertion
losses, propagation through the waveguides in DMAs and other electromagnetic
phenomena, we design a transmit Wiener filter solution for the three systems.
We then use these results to analyze the energy efficiency, considering
different consumption models and supplied power, and with particular focus on
the impact of the physical phenomena. DMAs emerge as an efficient alternative
to classical arrays across diverse tested scenarios, most notably under low
transmission power, strong coupling, and scalability requirements.

### [3] [Not all those who drift are lost: Drift correction and calibration scheduling for the IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09186)
*Aaron Hurst,Andrey V. Kalinichev,Klaus Koren,Daniel E. Lucani*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯过程回归的概率传感器漂移校正方法，显著降低均方误差，并提出不确定性驱动的校准优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器老化导致的漂移问题严重影响数据质量，传统方法需要大量真实数据且未考虑不确定性。

Method: 使用高斯过程回归建模传感器响应，结合不确定性驱动优化校准计划。

Result: 溶解氧传感器测试中，均方误差降低高达90%，平均超过20%，校准优化进一步降低15.7%。

Conclusion: 方法有效解决了传感器漂移问题，显著提升数据质量并优化校准效率。

Abstract: Sensors provide a vital source of data that link digital systems with the
physical world. However, as sensors age, the relationship between what they
measure and what they output changes. This is known as sensor drift and poses a
significant challenge that, combined with limited opportunity for
re-calibration, can severely limit data quality over time. Previous approaches
to drift correction typically require large volumes of ground truth data and do
not consider measurement or prediction uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a
probabilistic sensor drift correction method that takes a fundamental approach
to modelling the sensor response using Gaussian Process Regression. Tested
using dissolved oxygen sensors, our method delivers mean squared error (MSE)
reductions of up to 90% and more than 20% on average. We also propose a novel
uncertainty-driven calibration schedule optimisation approach that builds on
top of drift correction and further reduces MSE by up to 15.7%.

Conclusion: 研究表明，SNN不仅能用于分类任务，还可以作为编码机制，为未来生物启发的计算模型提供新思路。

Abstract: This study examines the integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)
with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While CPC learns the predictive structure
of data to generate meaningful representations, SNN mimics the computational
processes of biological neural systems over time. In this study, the goal is to
develop a predictive coding model with greater biological plausibility by
processing inputs and outputs in a spike-based system. The proposed model was
tested on the MNIST dataset and achieved a high classification rate in
distinguishing positive sequential samples from non-sequential negative
samples. The study demonstrates that CPC can be effectively combined with SNN,
showing that an SNN trained for classification tasks can also function as an
encoding mechanism. Project codes and detailed results can be accessed on our

### [5] [Graph Attention-based Decentralized Actor-Critic for Dual-Objective Control of Multi-UAV Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09195)
*Haoran Peng,Ying-Jun Angela Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

Method: 采用图注意力网络处理无人机的局部观察数据，结合Actor-Double-Critic网络管理双政策，并使用KL散度因子平衡目标间的权衡。

Result: 在理论和实验验证中，GADC表现出卓越的覆盖性能和电池寿命优化能力。

Conclusion: GADC在多无人机系统的双重目标优化中展现出高效性和可扩展性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: This research focuses on optimizing multi-UAV systems with dual objectives:
maximizing service coverage as the primary goal while extending battery
lifetime as the secondary objective. We propose a Graph Attention-based
Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) to optimize the dual objectives. The proposed
approach leverages a graph attention network to process UAVs' limited local
observation and reduce the dimension of the environment states. Subsequently,
an actor-double-critic network is developed to manage dual policies for joint
objective optimization. The proposed GADC uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence factor to balance the tradeoff between coverage performance and
battery lifetime in the multi-UAV system. We assess the scalability and
efficiency of GADC through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art
methods, considering both theory and experimental aspects. Extensive testing in
both ideal settings and NVIDIA Sionna's realistic ray tracing environment
demonstrates GADC's superior performance.

Conclusion: 该框架为高机动性无线网络提供了新的波束成形解决方案，并指出了未来研究的潜在方向。

Abstract: The article proposes a novel near-field predictive beamforming framework for
high-mobility wireless networks. Specifically, due to the spherical waves and
non-uniform Doppler frequencies brought by the near-field region, the new
ability of full-dimensional location and velocity sensing is characterized.
Building on this foundation, the near-field predictive beamforming framework is
proposed to proactively design beamformers for mobility users following
arbitrary trajectories. Compared to the conventional far-field counterpart, the
near-field predictive beamforming stands out due to: i) Prior-Knowledge-Free
Prediction, and ii) Low-Complexity and Generalizable System Design. To realize
these advantages, the implementation methods are discussed, followed by a case
study confirming the benefits of the proposed framework. Finally, the article
highlights promising research opportunities inspired by the proposed framework.

Result: 实验证明该模型在极短飞行时间（2纳秒）和扩展目标（1微秒）下优于当前最优方法，且能准确校正死区时间，适用于极短积分时间。

Conclusion: 该噪声模型为未来高通量和动态大气特征的精确研究提供了基础。

Abstract: This work derives and validates a noise model that encapsulates deadtime of
non-paralyzable detectors with random photon arrivals to enable advanced
processing, like maximum-likelihood estimation, of high resolution atmospheric
lidar profiles while accounting for deadtime bias. This estimator was validated
across a wide dynamic range at high resolution (4 millimeters in range, 17
milliseconds in time). Experiments demonstrate that the noise model outperforms
the current state-of-the-art for very short time-of-flight (2 nanoseconds) and
extended targets (1 microsecond). The proposed noise model also produces
accurate deadtime correction for very short integration times. This work sets
the foundation for further study into accurate retrievals of high flux and
dynamic atmospheric features, e.g., clouds and aerosol layers.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器学习的SEEG通道排序方法，结合临床医生选择和计算分析，用于识别癫痫发作相关通道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEEG信号人工检查耗时且低效，因此需要自动化方法帮助识别重要通道。

Method: 使用XGBoost分类模型和SHAP评分排序通道，并扩展搜索空间以发现新的可疑癫痫区。

Result: 对五名患者的SEEG数据分析显示，该方法在准确性、一致性和可解释性方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法可有效辅助SEEG数据分析，提高癫痫病灶定位效率。

Abstract: Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive technique to implant
depth electrodes and collect data for pre-surgery evaluation. Visual inspection
of signals recorded from hundreds of channels is time consuming and
inefficient. We propose a machine learning approach to rank the impactful
channels by incorporating clinician's selection and computational finding. A
classification model using XGBoost is trained to learn the discriminative
features of each channel during ictal periods. Then, the SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) scoring is utilized to rank SEEG channels based on their
contribution to seizures. A channel extension strategy is also incorporated to
expand the search space and identify suspicious epileptogenic zones beyond
those selected by clinicians. For validation, SEEG data for five patients were
analyzed showing promising results in terms of accuracy, consistency, and
explainability.

### [9] [Eigenvalue-Based Detection in MIMO Systems for Integrated Sensing and Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09439)
*Alex Obando,Saman Atapattu,Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa,Akram Hourani,Kandeepan Sithamparanathan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了MIMO集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统，提出了联合功率分配和阈值优化方案，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIMO ISAC研究常单独优化通信速率或检测概率，忽略了对检测可靠性与通信约束的联合分析，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用基于特征值的检测器进行鲁棒感知，并使用总检测误差作为性能指标。推导了特征值检测器的闭式表达式，并优化功率分配和阈值以最小化总检测误差。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提联合设计方案明显优于传统的CFAR方案，突出了功率和阈值优化的重要性。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论与仿真验证了联合优化的有效性，为MIMO ISAC系统的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper considers a MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)
system, where a base station simultaneously serves a MIMO communication user
and a remote MIMO sensing receiver, without channel state information (CSI) at
the transmitter. Existing MIMO ISAC literature often prioritizes communication
rate or detection probability, typically under constant false-alarm rate (CFAR)
assumptions, without jointly analyzing detection reliability and communication
constraints. To address this gap, we adopt an eigenvalue-based detector for
robust sensing and use a performance metric, the total detection error, that
jointly captures false-alarm and missed-detection probabilities. We derive
novel closed-form expressions for both probabilities under the eigenvalue
detector, enabling rigorous sensing analysis. Using these expressions, we
formulate and solve a joint power allocation and threshold optimization problem
that minimizes total detection error while meeting a minimum communication rate
requirement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint design
substantially outperforms conventional CFAR-based schemes, highlighting the
benefits of power- and threshold-aware optimization in MIMO ISAC systems.

### [10] [Mathematical proof of errors in Capasso's excess noise factor formula for an n-step staircase multiplier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09649)
*Ankitha E Bangera*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文证明了Capasso公式在计算阶梯式雪崩光电二极管的噪声因子时，错误地将Friis总噪声因子公式中的功率增益视为增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示Capasso公式在阶梯式雪崩光电二极管噪声分析中的错误，并纠正其对功率增益的处理问题。

Method: 通过理论分析，对比Capasso公式与Friis总噪声因子公式，指出其中的不一致之处。

Result: 发现Capasso公式对功率增益的错误处理，导致对噪声因子的估计不准确。

Conclusion: 文章纠正了Capasso公式的错误，为阶梯式雪崩光电二极管的噪声分析提供了更准确的理论基础。

Abstract: Solid-state devices such as multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs)
are analogues to the photomultiplier tubes and are considered as a
cascade-amplifier. The major source of internal noise in these APDs is due to
the randomness in their stepwise impact ionization. Recent literature on
staircase APDs by research groups such as Campbell and co-workers have reported
the theoretical estimates of total excess noise factors using Capasso's excess
noise factor formula. This formula is based on Friis' total noise factor
formula for cascade networks. This article proves that Capasso's formula for a
staircase APD, erroneously considers the power gains in Friis' total noise
factor formula as the gains.

### [11] [Don't be Afraid of Cell Complexes! An Introduction from an Applied Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09726)
*Josef Hoppe,Vincent P. Grande,Michael T. Schaub*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文旨在简化高阶网络模型——细胞复合体（CCs）的定义，使其更易于理解和应用，尤其关注信号处理和网络科学领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CCs的定义基于抽象的拓扑学概念，与信号处理方法脱节，作者希望通过更简单的定义弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出了抽象正则细胞复合体（ARCCs）的简化概念，仅依赖代数概念，并针对维数2及以下的CCs提供更简单的定义。

Result: ARCCs与正则细胞复合体在大多数实际应用中等效，且简化定义显著提升了CCs的可理解性和实用性。

Conclusion: 通过简化CCs的定义，本文使其更易于广泛应用，特别是为信号处理和网络科学领域提供了更直观的工具。

Abstract: Cell complexes (CCs) are a higher-order network model deeply rooted in
algebraic topology that has gained interest in signal processing and network
science recently. However, while the processing of signals supported on CCs can
be described in terms of easily-accessible algebraic or combinatorial notions,
the commonly presented definition of CCs is grounded in abstract concepts from
topology and remains disconnected from the signal processing methods developed
for CCs. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a simplified
definition of CCs that is accessible to a wider audience and can be used in
practical applications. Specifically, we first introduce a simplified notion of
abstract regular cell complexes (ARCCs). These ARCCs only rely on notions from
algebra and can be shown to be equivalent to regular cell complexes for most
practical applications. Second, using this new definition we provide an
accessible introduction to (abstract) cell complexes from a perspective of
network science and signal processing. Furthermore, as many practical
applications work with CCs of dimension 2 and below, we provide an even simpler
definition for this case that significantly simplifies understanding and
working with CCs in practice.

Result: 实验实现了对干扰信号高达43 dB的抑制，并通过误码率评估验证了系统的可行性。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来DMA无线系统的算法和技术挑战提供了实践基础，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising hybrid analog/digital
beamforming technology to realize next-generation wireless systems with low
cost, footprint, and power consumption. The research on DMA-empowered wireless
systems is still at an early stage, mostly limited to theoretical studies under
simplifying assumptions on the one hand and a few antenna-level experiments on
the other hand. Substantial knowledge gaps arise from the lack of complete
end-to-end DMA-empowered wireless system prototypes. In addition, recently
unveiled benefits of strong inter-element mutual coupling (MC) in DMAs remain
untapped. Here, we demonstrate a K-band prototype of an end-to-end wireless
system based on a DMA with strong inter-element MC. To showcase the flexible
control over the DMA's radiation pattern, we present an experimental case study
of simultaneously steering a beam to a desired transmitter and a null to an
undesired jammer, achieving up to 43~dB discrimination. Using software-defined
radios, we transmit and receive QPSK OFDM waveforms to evaluate the bit error
rate. We also discuss algorithmic and technological challenges associated with
envisioned future evolutions of our end-to-end testbed and real-life DMA-based
wireless systems.

Result: 在全脑钙成像应用中验证了框架的实用性，能够准确重建信号，即使样本与神经元映射不精确。

Conclusion: 该框架在处理样本与通道关联不精确的实际场景中表现出色，扩展了应用范围并提升了重建精度。

Abstract: Cross-channel unlabeled sensing addresses the problem of recovering a
multi-channel signal from measurements that were shuffled across channels. This
work expands the cross-channel unlabeled sensing framework to signals that lie
in a union of subspaces. The extension allows for handling more complex signal
structures and broadens the framework to tasks like compressed sensing. These
mismatches between samples and channels often arise in applications such as
whole-brain calcium imaging of freely moving organisms or multi-target
tracking. We improve over previous models by deriving tighter bounds on the
required number of samples for unique reconstruction, while supporting more
general signal types. The approach is validated through an application in
whole-brain calcium imaging, where organism movements disrupt sample-to-neuron
mappings. This demonstrates the utility of our framework in real-world settings
with imprecise sample-channel associations, achieving accurate signal
reconstruction.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用预训练开源基础模型（LWM）处理无线信道并结合深度强化学习（DRL）来优化基站波束成形和RIS配置的新框架，显著提高了频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可重构智能表面（RIS）在无线通信中有潜力，但其高效部署需要精确的信道状态信息（CSI），而由于RIS的被动性和大量反射元件，CSI估计的开销很高。

Method: 提出利用预训练的LWM模型生成信道嵌入，并设计DRL模型联合优化基站波束成形和RIS相移矩阵，以最大化频谱效率。

Result: 仿真结果显示，所提方法比基于DRL和波束扫描的方法分别提高了9.89%和43.66%的频谱效率。

Conclusion: 预训练的无线信号理解基础模型可以微调并与DRL结合，为无线网络的优化决策提供有效支持，突显了模态特定基础模型在实际网络优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a promising
technology for enhancing wireless communication by dynamically controlling
signal propagation in the environment. However, their efficient deployment
relies on accurate channel state information (CSI), which leads to high channel
estimation overhead due to their passive nature and the large number of
reflective elements. In this work, we solve this challenge by proposing a novel
framework that leverages a pre-trained open-source foundation model (FM) named
large wireless model (LWM) to process wireless channels and generate versatile
and contextualized channel embeddings. These embeddings are then used for the
joint optimization of the BS beamforming and RIS configurations. To be more
specific, for joint optimization, we design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
model to automatically select the BS beamforming vector and RIS phase-shift
matrix, aiming to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE). This work shows that a
pre-trained FM for radio signal understanding can be fine-tuned and integrated
with DRL for effective decision-making in wireless networks. It highlights the
potential of modality-specific FMs in real-world network optimization.
According to the simulation results, the proposed method outperforms the
DRL-based approach and beam sweeping-based approach, achieving 9.89% and 43.66%
higher SE, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文指出了Friis噪声因子公式在高阶级联网络中的主要错误，重新推导了正确的级联网络噪声因子计算公式，并与Friis公式进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Friis噪声因子公式在高阶级联网络中存在的错误。

Method: 从噪声因子的基本定义出发，重新推导级联网络的噪声因子计算公式。

Result: 提出了新的噪声因子计算公式，并通过与阶梯雪崩光电二极管的表达式对比验证了其正确性。

Conclusion: 新公式比Friis公式更准确地计算高阶级联网络的噪声因子。

Abstract: The signal-to-noise ratio of a multistage cascade network is often estimated
using the well-known Friis' formulas for noise factors (or the noise figures in
decibels). However, this article addresses the major errors in Friis' noise
factor formulas for higher stages. Additionally, we re-derive the correct
formulas to calculate the stage-wise noise factors for cascade networks from
the basic definition of noise factors. We then present a comparison of our
derived formulas with Friis' noise factor formulas. Contrary to Friis' formula,
we define the total noise factor of an n-stage cascade network as the product
of its stage-wise noise factors. We further validate our derived formulas for a
cascade network by correlating them with the expressions for a staircase
avalanche photodiode.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合音频与视觉特征的多模态框架，用于无参考信号的语音质量与可懂度评估，其性能优于仅使用音频的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在没有清洁参考信号的情况下，非侵入式评估语音质量和可懂度至关重要。

Method: 采用双分支架构，分别提取频谱特征（STFT）和视觉嵌入（视觉编码器），通过CNN-BLSTM结合注意力机制进行特征融合，并采用多任务学习同时预测PESQ和STOI。

Result: 在LRS3-TED数据集上的评估显示，该模型在已知噪声条件下，PESQ的LCC提升了9.61%，STOI的LCC提升了11.47%。

Abstract: Non-intrusive assessment of speech quality and intelligibility is essential
when clean reference signals are unavailable. In this work, we propose a
multimodal framework that integrates audio features and visual cues to predict
PESQ and STOI scores. It employs a dual-branch architecture, where spectral

visual encoder. These features are then fused and processed by a CNN-BLSTM with
attention, followed by multi-task learning to simultaneously predict PESQ and
STOI. Evaluations on the LRS3-TED dataset, augmented with noise from the DEMAND
corpus, show that our model outperforms the audio-only baseline. Under seen
noise conditions, it improves LCC by 9.61% (0.8397->0.9205) for PESQ and 11.47%
(0.7403->0.8253) for STOI. These results highlight the effectiveness of
incorporating visual cues in enhancing the accuracy of non-intrusive speech
assessment.

Abstract: The identification of the devices from which a message is received is part of
security mechanisms to ensure authentication in wireless communications.
Conventional authentication approaches are cryptography-based, which, however,
are usually computationally expensive and not adequate in the Internet of
Things (IoT), where devices tend to be low-cost and with limited resources.
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of physical layer-based device
fingerprinting, which is an emerging device authentication for wireless
security. In particular, this article focuses on hardware impairment-based
identity authentication and channel features-based authentication. They are
passive techniques that are readily applicable to legacy IoT devices. Their
intrinsic hardware and channel features, algorithm design methodologies,
application scenarios, and key research questions are extensively reviewed
here. The remaining research challenges are discussed, and future work is
suggested that can further enhance the physical layer-based device
fingerprinting.

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) offer the potential to achieve
large-scale antenna arrays with low power consumption and reduced hardware
costs, making them a promising technology for future communication systems.
This paper investigates the spectral efficiency (SE) of DMA-enabled multiuser
multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems in both uplink and downlink
transmissions, using only statistical channel state information (CSI) to
maximize the ergodic sum rate of multiple users. For the uplink system, we
consider two decoding rules: minimum mean square error (MMSE) with and without
successive interference cancellation (SIC). For both decoders, we derive
closed-form surrogates to substitute the original expressions of ergodic sum
rate and formulate tractable optimization problems for designing DMA weights.
Then, a weighted MMSE (WMMSE)-based algorithm is proposed to maximize the
ergodic sum rate. For the downlink system, we derive an approximate expression
for the ergodic sum rate and formulate a hybrid analog/digital beamforming
optimization problem that jointly optimizes the digital precoder and DMA
weights. A penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed by
leveraging the fractional programming framework. Numerical results validate the
accuracy of the derived surrogates and highlight the superiority of the
proposed algorithms over baseline schemes. It is shown that these algorithms
are effective across various DMA settings and are particularly well-suited for
system design in fast time-varying channels.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide an analytical study of single-carrier
faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling for integrated sensing and communications
(ISAC). Our derivations show that FTN is advantageous for ISAC, and reveal new
insights that these advantages come from the fact that FTN signaling can
effectively avoid the spectral aliasing due to the mismatch between the symbol
rate and the bandwidth of the shaping pulse. Specifically, the communication
spectral efficiency advantages of FTN signaling over time-invariant multipath
channels are analytically shown, where both upper- and lower-bounds on the
spectral efficiency are derived. We show that the gap between these two bounds
corresponds to the potential signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation due to the
presence of multipath delay and spectral aliasing, which diminishes as the
symbol rate grows higher. Particularly, in the limiting case, this SNR
variation disappears while the degree of freedom (DoF) of the system attain the
maximum. Furthermore, the sensing advantages for FTN signals are verified in
terms of the expected normalized squared ambiguity function. We show that FTN
signals generally enjoy a more robust ranging performance. More importantly, we
prove that FTN signaling can effectively avoid the undesired peaks in the
considered ambiguity function along the Doppler dimension, thereby reducing the
ambiguities in velocity estimation. All these conclusions are explicitly
verified by numerical results.
