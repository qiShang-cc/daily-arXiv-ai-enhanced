We analyzed Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from 2010-2019 to examine vessel speed over ground (SOG). Over half of the AIS records showed zero SOG, and treating zero and positive SOG as a single continuous process can obscure important patterns. We therefore applied a two-stage machine learning framework, first modeling the probability of SOG greater than zero and then modeling SOG conditional on being positive. AIS observations were integrated with sea ice concentration, course over ground, wind, bathymetric depth, distance to coast, vessel group, and navigational status. Gradient boosted decision trees with random effects captured nonlinear environmental responses while accounting for repeated observations. The positive SOG classifier achieved strong discrimination (AUC = 0.85), while the conditional speed model explained approximately 77 percent of out-of-fold variance. SHAP values quantified covariate effects by decomposing model predictions into additive contributions from individual variables. Distance to coast and bathymetric depth were dominant determinants of both the likelihood and magnitude of vessel speed, while changes in course, vessel group, and navigational status introduced secondary variation. Wind and sea ice effects were modest. Together, these results empirically characterize Arctic vessel operating regimes relevant to speed management and corridor-level assessment."}

It has recently been proposed as a powerful tool for executing consensus-based optimization algorithms in fully decentralized systems. A key advantage of NCOTA is that it enables unbiased consensus estimation without channel state information at either transmitters or receivers, requires no transmission scheduling, and scales efficiently to dense network deployments. However, NCOTA is inherently susceptible to external interference, which can bias the consensus estimate and deteriorate the convergence of the underlying decentralized optimization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel interference-robust (IR-)NCOTA scheme. The core idea is to apply a coordinated random rotation of the frame of reference across all nodes, and transmit a pseudo-random pilot signal, allowing to transform external interference into a circularly symmetric distribution with zero mean relative to the rotated frame. This ensures that the consensus estimates remain unbiased, preserving the convergence guarantees of the underlying optimization algorithm. Through numerical results on a classification task, it is demonstrated that IR-NCOTA exhibits superior performance over the baseline NCOTA algorithm in the presence of external interference."}

IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), May 2026, Glasgow, UK", "summary": "We experimentally demonstrate the performance gains achieved by an in-house built reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) integrated with a real-time 5G new radio (NR) system implemented using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework. We first quantify the gain in throughput achievable by integrating an RIS with a 5G system. Next, we show that randomly setting the RIS phase configuration and leveraging the inherent proportional fair (PF) scheduling mechanism of 5G NR can yield near-optimal throughput, provided the throughput averaging window of the PF scheduler is chosen judiciously. This occurs because, in each time slot, the PF scheduler naturally prioritizes data transmission to the user equipment (UE) that experiences the best channel conditions, namely, the UE to which the randomly configured RIS is aligned. Subsequently, we experimentally evaluate key performance metrics, including the reference signal received power (RSRP), block error rate (BLER), modulation and coding scheme (MCS) index, and throughput, under random RIS configurations. These results confirm that even a randomly configured RIS with negligible overhead can deliver performance comparable to optimized RIS designs, in real-world 5G NR wireless communication systems."}

Since automated algorithms for analyzing such signals increasingly inform clinically relevant decisions, identifying signal segments on which these algorithms may produce unreliable outputs is of critical importance. Signal quality indices (SQIs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, most existing SQIs are task agnostic and do not account for the specific algorithm and performance metric used downstream. In this work, we formalize signal quality as a task- and metric-dependent concept and propose a perturbation-based SQI (pSQI) that aims to detect an algorithm's performance degradation on an input signal with respect to a metric. The pSQI is defined as the worst-case value of the performance metric under an additive, colored Gaussian noise perturbation with a lower-bounded signal-to-noise ratio. We introduce formal requirements for task- and metric-specific SQIs, including monotonicity of the metric in expectation and maximal separation under thresholding. Experiments on R-peak detection and atrial fibrillation classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed pSQI consistently outperforms existing feature- and deep learning-based SQIs in identifying unreliable inputs without requiring training."}

Instead of distilling high-dimensional Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings using model-specific decoders, LatentAM proposes an online dictionary learning approach that is both model-agnostic and pretraining-free, enabling plug-and-play integration with different VLMs at test time. Specifically, our approach associates each Gaussian primitive with a compact query vector that can be converted into approximate VLM embeddings using an attention mechanism with a learnable dictionary. The dictionary is initialized efficiently from streaming observations and optimized online to adapt to evolving scene semantics under trust-region regularization. To scale to long trajectories and large environments, we further propose an efficient map management strategy based on voxel hashing, where optimization is restricted to an active local map on the GPU, while the global map is stored and indexed on the CPU to maintain bounded GPU memory usage.

In the proposed design, a low-dimensional SIM probing codebook is first constructed by maximizing the mutual information between the RSRP feedback and the site-specific channel. This design not only reduces the initial beam sweeping overhead, but also enhances the amount of channel state information conveyed through UE feedback. By treating the RSRP feedback as a conditional prior, a CFM-based generative model is further developed to explicitly capture the uncertainty in beam generation. Specifically, a small set of UE-specific candidate beams is generated by inferring the learned generative model and sampling from the corresponding posterior distribution, after which the final data transmission beam is selected by the UE. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed SIM codebook and the CFM-based beam generator.

Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) is considered as a main technology in enabling operational advancements including Automatic Train Operation (ATO), moving block signaling, and virtual coupling, which are the core components of the Horizon Europe 2024 rail digitalization agenda. However, GNSS signal integrity is increasingly threatened by intentional and unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI). This include jamming and spoofing, which are particularly concerning as the broadcasted signal can deliberately disrupt or manipulate the GNSS signal. - Jamming refers to an intentional form of interference that induces disturbances in the GNSS band, causing performance degradation or can even entirely block the receiver from acquiring the satellite signals. - Spoofing involves broadcasting counterfeit satellite signals to deceive the GNSS receiver, leading to inaccurate estimation of position, navigation and timing information. This concern about interference is not unique to rail applications. The aeronautical sector has long recognized the risks posed by GNSS interference, with extensive documentation on its impact on navigation, landing procedures, and surveillance systems. In recent years, awareness of these risks has expanded to other transport sectors. Within the automotive industry, particularly in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), several studies [2][3][4] have addressed the vulnerability of GNSS against interference. Similar concerns are now emerging in the rail domain [5][6][7], especially as GNSS is increasingly adopted in safety-critical applications. In literature, several levels of actions have been explored, ranging from merely the detection of a malicious signal at the initial phase to the application of advanced signal processing methods aimed at suppressing the effects of interference [8]. In alignment with the goal of the R2DATO project, we evaluated the impact of various classes of interference signals such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), pulsed, frequency hopping and chirp signals on the GNSS observables including Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and Carrier to Noise Ratio (CNO) as measured by a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS). However, in this work, the analysis is only limited to impact of chirp interference on GPS L1 receiver observables and detection performance."}

However, its high computational cost, dominated by repeated log-determinant evaluations, has limited its use in real-time planning. This letter presents Schur-MI, a Gaussian process (GP) MI formulation that (i) leverages the iterative structure of RIG to precompute and reuse expensive intermediate quantities across planning steps, and (ii) uses a Schur-complement factorization to avoid large determinant computations. Together, these methods reduce the per-evaluation cost of MI from $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{V}|^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{A}|^3)$, where $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$ denote the candidate and selected sensing locations, respectively. Experiments on real-world bathymetry datasets show that Schur-MI achieves up to a $12.7\\times$ speedup over the standard MI formulation. Field trials with an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) performing adaptive IPP further validate its practicality. By making MI computation tractable for online planning, Schur-MI helps bridge the gap between information-theoretic objectives and real-time robotic exploration."}

While extensive research focuses on planar RIS architectures, practical deployments often involve non-planar surfaces, such as structural columns or curved facades, where standard planar beamforming models fail. Moreover, existing analytical solutions for curved RISs are often restricted to specific, pre-defined array manifold geometries. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel deep learning (DL) framework for optimizing the phase shifts of non-planar RISs. We first introduce a low-dimensional parametric model to capture arbitrary surface curvature effectively. Based on this, we design a neural network (NN) that utilizes a sparse set of received power measurements to estimate the surface geometry and derive the optimal phase configuration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges fast and significantly outperforms conventional planar beamforming designs, validating its robustness against arbitrary surface curvature. We also analyze the impact of the measurement location error on the algorithm's performance."}

Unlike existing single-turn paradigm, LongNav-R1 reformulates the navigation decision process as a continuous multi-turn conversation between the VLA policy and the embodied environment. This multi-turn RL framework offers two distinct advantages: i) it enables the agent to reason about the causal effects of historical interactions and sequential future outcomes; and ii) it allows the model to learn directly from online interactions, fostering diverse trajectory generation and avoiding the behavioral rigidity often imposed by human demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Horizon-Adaptive Policy Optimization. This mechanism explicitly accounts for varying horizon lengths during advantage estimation, facilitating accurate temporal credit assignment over extended sequences. Consequently, the agent develops diverse navigation behaviors and resists collapse during long-horizon tasks. Experiments on object navigation benchmarks validate the framework's efficacy: With 4,000 rollout trajectories, LongNav-R1 boosts the Qwen3-VL-2B success rate from 64.3% to 73.0%. These results demonstrate superior sample efficiency and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. The model's generalizability and robustness are further validated by its zero-shot performance in long-horizon real-world navigation settings. All source code will be open-sourced upon publication."}

OFDM is known to be sensitive to phase noise, which could limit the potential gains promised by RIS systems. OTFS, on the other hand, is a compelling potential waveform for RIS-aided systems in the presence of phase noise due to it's resilience to time-varying channels. However, the effect of phase noise on OTFS has not been fully analyzed in the literature as of yet. Additionally, no existing works in the literature consider the effect of phase noise on an RIS-aided OTFS system. Hence, we propose a joint RIS channel and phase noise estimation technique using a Wiener filtering approach. Our proposed method exploits the statistical nature of both the phase noise and the Doppler spread channel in a setup with RIS. Our numerical analysis demonstrates the significant gain of RIS-aided OTFS offers compared to RIS-aided OFDM in the presence in the presence of phase noise. Additionally, our results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed estimation technique, with gains of up to 3~dB in terms of bit error rate (BER), over existing methods in the literature."}

Traditional vision-based 3D reconstruction methods lack RT compatibility due to geometrically defective meshes and missing material properties. This paper presents Holistic Reconstruction with Automated Material Assignment (HoRAMA) for wireless propagation prediction using NYURay. HoRAMA generates RT-compatible 3D models from RGB video readily captured using a smartphone or low-cost portable camera, by integrating MASt3R-SLAM dense point cloud generation with vision language model-assisted material assignment. The HoRAMA 3D reconstruction method is verified by comparing NYURay RT predictions, using both manually created and HoRAMA-generated 3D models, against field measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz across 12 TX-RX locations in a 700 square meter factory. HoRAMA ray tracing predictions achieve a 2.28 dB RMSE for matched multipath component (MPC) power predictions, comparable to the manually created 3D model baseline (2.18 dB), while reducing 3D reconstruction time from two months to 16 hours.

We address this problem by introducing ARMOR: Adaptive Round-based Multi-task mOdel for Robotic failure detection and reasoning. We formulate detection and reasoning as a multi-task self-refinement process, where the model iteratively predicts detection outcomes and natural language reasoning conditioned on past outputs. During training, ARMOR learns from heterogeneous supervision - large-scale sparse binary labels and small-scale rich reasoning annotations - optimized via a combination of offline and online imitation learning. At inference time, ARMOR generates multiple refinement trajectories and selects the most confident prediction via a self-certainty metric. Experiments across diverse environments show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving over the previous approaches by up to 30% on failure detection rate and up to 100% in reasoning measured through LLM fuzzy match score, demonstrating robustness to heterogeneous supervision and open-ended reasoning beyond predefined failure modes.

These environments are dynamic and often visually occluded, which complicates perception and navigation. In this context, valuable information from audio sources remains underutilized in most autonomy stacks. This work presents a control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filter that provides safety guarantees for obstacle avoidance while adapting safety margins during navigation using an audio-derived risk cue. The proposed framework augments the CBF with a lightweight, real-time jackhammer detector based on signal envelope and periodicity. Its output serves as an exogenous risk that is directly enforced in the controller by modulating the barrier function. The approach is evaluated in simulation with two CBF formulations (circular and goal-aligned elliptical) with a unicycle robot navigating a cluttered construction environment. Results show that the CBF safety filter eliminates safety violations across all trials while reaching the target in 40.2% (circular) vs. 76.5% (elliptical), as the elliptical formulation better avoids deadlock. This integration of audio perception into a CBF-based controller demonstrates a pathway toward richer multimodal safety reasoning in autonomous robots for safety-critical and dynamic environments."}

Specifically, the LIS elements are distributed in 3D space within a long corridor, rather than being confined to a single planar aperture, and the focal point is located at a prescribed position in the radiating near field. By formulating optimization problems under both local and global power constraints, we obtain the corresponding optima. For continuous apertures, the optimal current magnitude distribution matches time-reversal (TR) solution under the global constraint and conjugate-phase (CP) solution when the local constraint dominates. When both constraints are active, the solution assigns larger excitation magnitudes to elements closer to the illumination field. This behavior remains invariant with respect to frequency and polarization for a fixed-size LIS. These findings are consistent to the more practical case of using discretized apertures in the form of Hertzian dipole arrays, studied using both analytical results and full-wave simulation. In addition, with the CP method, specific polarizations lead to identical transverse and longitudinal resolution, in contrast, under the TR method, these quantities can differ across polarizations."}

While traditional GP-based approaches provide reliable Bayesian predictions with uncertainty quantification, they are computationally expensive and thus unsuitable for real-time simulations. To address this challenge, we integrate gradient information to improve accuracy and introduce a novel partitioning and approximation strategy to reduce online computational cost. In particular, for the latter, we associate a local GP with each non-overlapping region; by splitting the training data into local near and far subsets, and by using Schur complements, we show that a large part of the matrix inversions required for inference can be performed offline, enabling real-time inference at frequencies above 30 Hz on standard desktop hardware. To generate a training dataset that captures aerodynamic effects, such as rotor-rotor interactions and apparent wind direction, we use the CHARM code, which is a mid-fidelity aerodynamic solver. It is applied to the SUI Endurance quadrotor to predict force and torque, along with noise at three specified locations. The derivative information is obtained via finite differences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed partitioned GP with gradient conditioning achieves higher accuracy than standard partitioned GPs without gradient information, while greatly reducing computational time. This framework provides an efficient foundation for real-time aerodynamic prediction and control algorithms in complex and unsteady environments."}

In this paper, we present FPNet, a unified deep learning framework that jointly addresses channel feedback compression, accurate indoor positioning, and robust anomaly detection (AD). FPNet leverages the beamforming feedback matrix (BFM), a compressed CSI representation natively supported by IEEE 802.11ac/ax/be protocols, to minimize feedback overhead while preserving critical positioning features. To enhance reliability, we integrate ADBlock, a lightweight AD module trained on normal BFM samples, which identifies out-of-distribution scenarios when users exit predefined spatial regions.

To address this, we introduce CRAFT, a force-aware curriculum fine-tuning framework that integrates a variational information bottleneck module to regulate vision and language embeddings during early training. This curriculum strategy encourages the model to prioritize force signals initially, before progressively restoring access to the full multimodal information. To enable force-aware learning, we further design a homologous leader-follower teleoperation system that collects synchronized vision, language, and force data across diverse contact-rich tasks. Real-world experiments demonstrate that CRAFT consistently improves task success, generalizes to unseen objects and novel task variations, and adapts effectively across diverse VLA architectures, enabling robust and generalizable contact-rich manipulation."}

The key to our method lies in a carefully designed training recipe and deployment strategy.

During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation.

This work studies how robots can similarly exploit signs for mapless navigation in the open world. A central challenge lies in interpreting signs: real-world signs are diverse and complex, and their abstract semantic contents need to be grounded in the local 3D scene. We formalize this as sign grounding, the problem of mapping semantic instructions on signs to corresponding scene elements and navigational actions. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the semantic common-sense and reasoning capabilities required for this task, but are sensitive to how spatial information is represented. We propose SignScene, a sign-centric spatial-semantic representation that captures navigation-relevant scene elements and sign information, and presents them to VLMs in a form conducive to effective reasoning. We evaluate our grounding approach on a dataset of 114 queries collected across nine diverse environment types, achieving 88% grounding accuracy and significantly outperforming baselines. Finally, we demonstrate that it enables real-world mapless navigation on a Spot robot using only signs."}

Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training.

Traditional fuzzy PID tuning often relies on empirical methods, making it difficult to achieve a stable and reproducible equilibrium solution between performance enhancement and control cost. This paper proposes a constrained particle swarm optimization (PSO) method for tuning six-parameter fuzzy PID controllers. By adjusting the benchmark PID parameters alongside the fuzzy controller's input quantization factor and output proportional gain, it achieves synergistic optimization of the overall tuning strength and dynamic response characteristics of the fuzzy PID system. To ensure engineering feasibility of the optimization results, a time-weighted absolute error integral, adjustment time, relative overshoot control energy, and saturation occupancy rate are introduced. Control energy constraints are applied to construct a constraint-driven comprehensive evaluation system, suppressing pseudo-improvements achieved solely by increasing control inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that, while maintaining consistent control energy and saturation levels, the proposed method significantly enhances deep tracking performance: the time-weighted absolute error integral decreases from 0.2631 to 0.1473, the settling time shortens from 2.301 s to 1.613 s, and the relative overshoot reduces from 0.1494 to 0.01839. Control energy varied from 7980 to 7935, satisfying the energy constraint, while saturation occupancy decreased from 0.004 to 0.003.

Conventional quadrupedal navigation typically separates motion planning from locomotion control, neglecting whole-body constraints and terrain awareness.

In addition, most existing approaches assume static environments, limiting their use in human-populated settings. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage training framework with three DRL pipelines. (1) TRANS-Loco employs an asymmetric actor-critic (AC) model for quadrupedal locomotion, enabling traversal of uneven terrains without explicit terrain or contact observations. (2) TRANS-Nav applies a symmetric AC framework for social navigation, directly mapping transformed LiDAR data to ego-agent actions under differential-drive kinematics.

When exploring such fabrics, fingertip skin senses both spatio-temporal force patterns and texture-induced vibrations that are integrated to form a haptic representation of the explored material. It is challenging to reproduce this rich, dynamic perceptual capability in robots because tactile sensors typically cannot achieve both high spatial resolution and high temporal sampling rate. In this work, we present a system that can sense both types of haptic information, and we investigate how each type influences robotic tactile perception of fabrics. Our robotic hand's middle finger and thumb each feature a soft tactile sensor: one is the open-source Minsight sensor that uses an internal camera to measure fingertip deformation and force at 50 Hz, and the other is our new sensor Minsound that captures vibrations through an internal MEMS microphone with a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 15 kHz. Inspired by the movements humans make to evaluate fabrics, our robot actively encloses and rubs folded fabric samples between its two sensitive fingers. Our results test the influence of each sensing modality on overall classification performance, showing high utility for the audio-based sensor. Our transformer-based method achieves a maximum fabric classification accuracy of 97 % on a dataset of 20 common fabrics. Incorporating an external microphone away from Minsound increases our method's robustness in loud ambient noise conditions. To show that this audio-visual tactile sensing approach generalizes beyond the training data, we learn general representations of fabric stretchiness, thickness, and roughness."}

However, existing approaches are fundamentally misaligned with the needs of embodied tasks. As they rely on either offline batch processing or implicit feature embeddings, the maps can hardly support interpretable human-intent reasoning in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present INHerit-SG. We redefine the map as a structured, RAG-ready knowledge base where natural-language descriptions are introduced as explicit semantic anchors to better align with human intent. An asynchronous dual-process architecture, together with a Floor-Room-Area-Object hierarchy, decouples geometric segmentation from time-consuming semantic reasoning. An event-triggered map update mechanism reorganizes the graph only when meaningful semantic events occur. This strategy enables our graph to maintain long-term consistency with relatively low computational overhead. For retrieval, we deploy multi-role Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose queries into atomic constraints and handle logical negations, and employ a hard-to-soft filtering strategy to ensure robust reasoning. This explicit interpretability improves the success rate and reliability of complex retrievals, enabling the system to adapt to a broader spectrum of human interaction tasks. We evaluate INHerit-SG on a newly constructed dataset, HM3DSem-SQR, and in real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex queries, and reveal its scalability for downstream navigation tasks.

Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time."}

Hence, we investigate the impact of feature sets for collective behaviours. We select swarm feature sets and similarity measures from prior swarm robotics works, which mainly considered a narrow behavioural context and assess their robustness. We demonstrate that the interplay of feature set and similarity measure makes some combinations more suitable to distinguish groups of similar behaviours. We also propose a self-organised map-based approach to identify regions of the feature space where behaviours cannot be easily distinguished."}

To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively.

As the robots move throughout the environment and towards their goal, the optimal route is continuously revised as the sensors perceive new information. In traditional autonomous navigation architectures, a regional motion planner will consume the environment map and output a trajectory for the local motion planner to use as a reference. Due to the continuous revision of the regional plan guidance as a result of changing map information, the reference trajectories which are passed down to the local planner can differ significantly across sequential planning cycles. This rapidly changing guidance can result in unsafe navigation behavior, often requiring manual safety interventions during autonomous traversals in off-road environments. To remedy this problem, we propose Temporally-Sampled Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (TSEASL), which is a regional planner arbitration architecture that considers updated and optimized versions of previously generated trajectories against the currently generated trajectory. When tested on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle as well as real map data collected from the Warthog, results indicate that when running TSEASL, the robot did not require manual interventions in the same locations where the robot was running the baseline planner. Additionally, higher levels of planner stability were recorded with TSEASL over the baseline. The paper concludes with a discussion of further improvements to TSEASL in order to make it more generalizable to various off-road autonomy scenarios."}

However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning.

Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities. We show through real-world experiments that our framework can be used to learn precise manipulation skills efficiently without any robot data, resulting in significantly more robust performance than using a grasp generator naively."}

In this paper, we present an improved Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) with lower computational cost while maintaining estimation accuracy, which is named \"Kaisoku Cubature Kalman Filter (KCKF)\". The computationally efficient equations of the KCKF are derived by simplifying those of the CKF, while preserving equivalent mathematical relations. The lightweight prediction equations in the KCKF are derived by expanding the summation terms in the CKF and simplifying the result. This paper shows that the KCKF requires fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) than the CKF. The controlled experimental results show that the KCKF reduces the computation time by approximately 19% compared to the CKF on a high-performance computer, whereas the KCKF reduces the computation time by approximately 15% compared to the CKF on a low-cost single-board computer. In addition, the KCKF maintains the attitude estimation accuracy of the CKF."}

However, existing robotic approaches either focus primarily on grasping or target object-specific articulated manipulation, and they rarely incorporate explicit actuation energy into multi-objective optimisation, which limits their scalability and suitability for long-term deployment in real O&M settings. Therefore, this paper proposes an articulation-agnostic and energy-aware reinforcement learning framework for robotic manipulation in intelligent infrastructure O&M. The method combines part-guided 3D perception, weighted point sampling, and PointNet-based encoding to obtain a compact geometric representation that generalises across heterogeneous articulated objects. Manipulation is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), in which actuation energy is explicitly modelled and regulated via a Lagrangian-based constrained Soft Actor-Critic scheme. The policy is trained end-to-end under this CMDP formulation, enabling effective articulated-object operation while satisfying a long-horizon energy budget. Experiments on representative O&M tasks demonstrate 16%-30% reductions in energy consumption, 16%-32% fewer steps to success, and consistently high success rates, indicating a scalable and sustainable solution for infrastructure O&M manipulation."}

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{AD-LiST-JEPA}, a self-supervised world model for autonomous driving that predicts future spatiotemporal evolution from LiDAR data using a JEPA framework. We evaluate the quality of the learned representations through a downstream LiDAR-based occupancy completion and forecasting (OCF) task, which jointly assesses perception and prediction. Proof of concept experiments show better OCF performance with pretrained encoder after JEPA-based world model learning."}

Hota", "Lars Lindemann"], "title": "When Environments Shift: Safe Planning with Generative Priors and Robust Conformal Prediction", "categories": ["eess.SY", "cs.RO"], "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous systems operate in environments that may change over time. An example is the control of a self-driving vehicle among pedestrians and human-controlled vehicles whose behavior may change based on factors such as traffic density, road visibility, and social norms. Therefore, the environment encountered during deployment rarely mirrors the environment and data encountered during training -- a phenomenon known as distribution shift -- which can undermine the safety of autonomous systems. Conformal prediction (CP) has recently been used along with data from the training environment to provide prediction regions that capture the behavior of the environment with a desired probability. When embedded within a model predictive controller (MPC), one can provide probabilistic safety guarantees, but only when the deployment and training environments coincide. Once a distribution shift occurs, these guarantees collapse. We propose a planning framework that is robust under distribution shifts by: (i) assuming that the underlying data distribution of the environment is parameterized by a nuisance parameter, i.e., an observable, interpretable quantity such as traffic density, (ii) training a conditional diffusion model that captures distribution shifts as a function of the nuisance parameter, (iii) observing the nuisance parameter online and generating cheap, synthetic data from the diffusion model for the observed nuisance parameter, and (iv) designing an MPC that embeds CP regions constructed from such synthetic data. Importantly, we account for discrepancies between the underlying data distribution and the diffusion model by using robust CP. Thus, the plans computed using robust CP enjoy probabilistic safety guarantees, in contrast with plans obtained from a single, static set of training data. We empirically demonstrate safety under diverse distribution shifts in the ORCA simulator."}

Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently."}

Positive or negative media framing may shape and shift how individuals evaluate HRC. This study examines how message framing moderates the effects of perceived risks and perceived benefits on overall attributed value. In a pre-registered study, participants (N = 1150) were randomly assigned to read either a positively or negatively framed newspaper article in one of three industrial contexts (autonomy, employment, safety) about HRC in production. Subsequently, perceived risks, benefits, and value were measured using reliable and publicly available psychometric scales. Two multiple regressions (one per framing condition) tested for main and interaction effects. Framing influenced absolute evaluations of risk, benefits, and value. In both frames, risks and benefits significantly predicted attributed value. Under positive framing, only main effects were observed (risks: beta = -0.52; benefits: beta = 0.45). Under negative framing, both predictors had stronger main effects (risks: beta = -0.69; benefits: beta = 0.63) along with a significant negative interaction (beta = -0.32), indicating that higher perceived risk diminishes the positive effect of perceived benefits. Model fit was higher for the positive frame (R^2 = 0.715) than for the negative frame (R^2 = 0.583), indicating greater explained variance in value attributions. Framing shapes the absolute evaluation of HRC and how risks and benefits are cognitively integrated in trade-offs. Negative framing produces stronger but interdependent effects, whereas positive framing supports additive evaluations. These findings highlight the role of strategic communication in fostering acceptance of HRC and underscore the need to consider framing in future HRC research."}

The algorithm does not require knowledge of the system dynamics but instead uses only a finite-length sampling of arbitrary input-output data. The algorithm is based on a constrained optimization problem that enforces a necessary condition on the dynamics of the optimal value function along any trajectory. In addition to calculating the standard LQR gain matrix, a feedforward gain can be found to implement a reference tracking controller. This paper presents a theoretical justification for the method and shows several examples, including a validation test on a real scale aircraft."}
