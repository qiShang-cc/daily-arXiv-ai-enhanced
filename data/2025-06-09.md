TL;DR: 该研究评估了无人机搭载便携式L波段辐射计（PoLRa）在不同地表覆盖（灌木丛、裸土和森林带）中的土壤湿度（SM）反演效果，并通过贝叶斯推理框架量化了不确定性。结果显示，反演精度高，且不确定性范围较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前卫星被动微波任务无法提供高分辨率（几十米）的土壤湿度观测数据，而无人机搭载微波辐射计技术具有潜力，但此前研究多集中于农业场景，且缺乏对其他地表覆盖和不确定性量化的探索。

Method: 研究使用无人机在不同高度（10 m、20 m、30 m）飞行，生成不同空间分辨率（7 m、14 m、21 m）的亮度温度数据，并采用多种基于tau-omega模型的算法（SCA、DCA、MTDCA）反演土壤湿度。同时应用贝叶斯推理框架量化不确定性。

Result: 结果表明，反演结果能够捕捉干湿梯度，且与实地测量数据对比显示，ubRMSE普遍低于0.04 m3/m3。贝叶斯分析证实了不确定性范围的合理性，分别为SCA和DCA相关反演提供了0.02 m3/m3和0.11 m3/m3的平均不确定性范围。

Conclusion: 无人机搭载微波辐射计技术在高分辨率土壤湿度观测中表现出色，且通过贝叶斯方法成功量化了不确定性，为农业、林业和灾害预测提供了实用工具。

Abstract: High-resolution soil moisture (SM) observations are critical for agricultural
monitoring, forestry management, and hazard prediction, yet current satellite
passive microwave missions cannot directly provide retrievals at tens-of-meter
spatial scales. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted microwave radiometry
presents a promising alternative, but most evaluations to date have focused on
agricultural settings, with limited exploration across other land covers and
few efforts to quantify retrieval uncertainty. This study addresses both gaps
by evaluating SM retrievals from a drone-based Portable L-band Radiometer
(PoLRa) across shrubland, bare soil, and forest strips in Central Illinois,
U.S., using a 10-day field campaign in 2024. Controlled UAV flights at
altitudes of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m were performed to generate brightness
temperatures (TB) at spatial resolutions of 7 m, 14 m, and 21 m. SM retrievals
were carried out using multiple tau-omega-based algorithms, including the
single channel algorithm (SCA), dual channel algorithm (DCA), and
multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MTDCA). A Bayesian inference framework
was then applied to provide probabilistic uncertainty characterization for both
SM and vegetation optical depth (VOD). Results show that the gridded TB
distributions consistently capture dry-wet gradients associated with vegetation
density variations, and spatial correlations between polarized observations are
largely maintained across scales. Validation against in situ measurements
indicates that PoLRa derived SM retrievals from the SCAV and MTDCA algorithms
achieve unbiased root-mean-square errors (ubRMSE) generally below 0.04 m3/m3
across different land covers. Bayesian posterior analyses confirm that
reference SM values largely fall within the derived uncertainty intervals, with
mean uncertainty ranges around 0.02 m3/m3 and 0.11 m3/m3 for SCA and DCA
related retrievals.

### [3] [On Level Crossings and Fade Durations in von Mises-Fisher Scattering Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05898)
*Kenan Turbic,Slawomir Stanczak*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了具有vMF分布散射体的多径衰落信道的二阶统计特性，推导了多普勒频移和扩展的封闭解，分析了参数对LCR的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨vMF分布散射体对衰落信道动态特性的影响，特别是通过多普勒统计量捕捉移动和散射特性的关系。

Method: 推导了vMF分布下的多普勒频移和扩展的封闭解，并将其应用于分析LCR。

Result: 各向同性散射的LCR最高；散射体角度扩展越小，衰落动态越弱；移动天线平行于主散射方向时的LCR低于垂直运动。

Conclusion: 散射体的空间分布和天线运动方向对衰落信道的动态特性有显著影响。

Abstract: This paper investigates the second-order statistics of multipath fading
channels with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributed scatters. Simple closed-form
expressions for the mean Doppler shift and Doppler spread are derived as the
key spectral moments that capture the impact of mobility and scattering
characteristics on level crossings and fade durations. These expressions are
then used to analyze the influence of vMF parameters on the Level-Crossing Rate
(LCR) The results show that isotropic scattering yields the highest LCR, while
fading dynamics reduce with the decreasing angular spread of scatterers.
Moreover, obile antenna motion parallel to the mean scattering direction
results in a lower LCR than the perpendicular motion, with the difference
between the two cases increasing with the higher concentration of scatterers.

### [4] [Multi-Modal Large Models Based Beam Prediction: An Example Empowered by DeepSeek](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05921)

TL;DR: 提出了基于多模态大模型的波束预测框架MLM-BP，通过融合环境信息提升泛化能力，在仿真和真实数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有波束预测模型在多样化场景中泛化能力不足，需结合多模态环境信息以提升性能。

Method: 利用传感器捕获散射体分布，生成文本表示；通过LoRA微调的图像编码器提取环境嵌入，结合大模型预测最优波束。

Result: 仿真数据集上Top-1准确率98.1%；真实数据集中仅用30%数据即达到72.7% Top-1精度，超越小模型15%。

Conclusion: MLM-BP通过多模态信息融合显著提升了波束预测的泛化能力，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Beam prediction is an effective approach to reduce training overhead in
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, existing beam
prediction models still exhibit limited generalization ability in diverse
scenarios, which remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose
MLM-BP, a beam prediction framework based on the multi-modal large model
released by DeepSeek, with full consideration of multi-modal environmental
information. Specifically, the distribution of scatterers that impact the
optimal beam is captured by the sensing devices. Then positions are tokenized
to generate text-based representations, and multi-view images are processed by
an image encoder, which is fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to
extract environmental embeddings. Finally, these embeddings are fed into the
large model, and an output projection module is designed to determine the
optimal beam index. Simulation results show that MLM-BP achieves 98.1% Top-1
accuracy on the simulation dataset. Additionally, it demonstrates few-shot
generalization on a real-world dataset, achieving 72.7% Top-1 accuracy and
92.4% Top-3 accuracy with only 30% of the dataset, outperforming the existing
small models by over 15%.

### [5] [A Flexible Design Framework for Integrated Communication and Computing Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05944)
*Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe,Kengo Ando,Hyeon Seok Rou,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu,Takumi Takahashi,Marco Di Renzo,David González G*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种同时支持数据符号检测和空中计算（AirComp）的集成通信与计算（ICC）接收器框架，适用于大规模用户设备（UEs）和边缘设备（EDs）的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在无线通信系统中实现高效的数据传输与计算功能，尤其是支持多用户和多功能的并行操作，同时满足大规模设备的需求。

Method: 基于高斯置信传播（GaBP）框架，设计多流和多接入方法，结合封闭形式的组合器，实现大规模场景下的高效运行。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在高达200个天线和300个用户设备/边缘设备的场景下表现良好，接近理论性能极限。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于大规模无线通信与计算集成系统。

Abstract: We propose a framework to design integrated communication and computing (ICC)
receivers capable of simultaneously detecting data symbols and performing
over-the-air computing (AirComp) in a manner that: a) is systematically
generalizable to any nomographic function, b) scales to a massive number of
user equipments (UEs) and edge devices (EDs), c) supports the computation of
multiple independent functions (streams), and d) operates in a multi-access
fashion whereby each transmitter can choose to transmit either data symbols,
computing signals or both. For the sake of illustration, we design the proposed
multi-stream and multi-access method under an uplink setting, where multiple
single-antenna UEs/EDs simultaneously transmit data and computing signals to a
single multiple-antenna base station (BS)/access point (AP). Under the
communication functionality, the receiver aims to detect all independent
communication symbols while treating the computing streams as aggregate
interference which it seeks to mitigate; and conversely, under the computing
functionality, to minimize the distortion over the computing streams while
minimizing their mutual interference as well as the interference due to data
symbols. To that end, the design leverages the Gaussian belief propagation
(GaBP) framework relying only on element-wise scalar operations coupled with
closed-form combiners purpose-built for the AirComp operation, which allows for
its use in massive settings, as demonstrated by simulation results
incorporating up to 200 antennas and 300 UEs/EDs. The efficacy of the proposed
method under different loading conditions is also evaluated, with the
performance of the scheme shown to approach fundamental limiting bounds in the
under/fully loaded cases.

### [6] [Dual Approach to Inverse Covariance Intersection Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05955)
*Jiří Ajgl,Ondřej Straka*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了在估计误差相关性的部分知识情况下，特别是针对‘共同噪声’的线性融合问题，提出了理论分析和实际改进，尽管在单一均方误差上限方面结果不理想，但在子优化情况下优于无知识情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理‘共同信息’或‘共同噪声’的线性融合问题，尤其是在严格定义下的‘共同噪声’尚未被研究的情况下。

Method: 首先提出‘共同噪声’假设，接着进行理论性质分析和实例验证。

Result: 尽管在单一均方误差上限方面表现不佳，但在子优化情况下部分知识优于无知识情况。

Conclusion: 论文填补了‘共同噪声’严格定义下线性融合的空白，并展示了部分知识在某些情况下的优势。

Abstract: Linear fusion of estimates under the condition of no knowledge of correlation
of estimation errors has reached maturity. On the other hand, various cases of
partial knowledge are still active research areas. A frequent motivation is to
deal with "common information" or "common noise", whatever it means. A fusion
rule for a strict meaning of the former expression has already been elaborated.
Despite the dual relationship, a strict meaning of the latter one has not been
considered so far. The paper focuses on this area. The assumption of unknown
"common noise" is formulated first, analysis of theoretical properties and
illustrations follow. Although the results are disappointing from the
perspective of a single upper bound of mean square error matrices, the partial
knowledge demonstrates improvement over no knowledge in suboptimal cases and
from the perspective of families of upper bounds.

Abstract: The conventional FL methods face critical challenges in realistic wireless
edge networks, where training data is both limited and heterogeneous, often
leading to unstable training and poor generalization. To address these
challenges in a principled manner, we propose a novel wireless FL framework
grounded in Bayesian inference. By virtue of the Bayesian approach, our
framework captures model uncertainty by maintaining distributions over local
weights and performs distribution-level aggregation of local distributions into
a global distribution. This mitigates local overfitting and client drift,
thereby enabling more reliable inference. Nevertheless, adopting Bayesian FL
increases communication overhead due to the need to transmit richer model
information and fundamentally alters the aggregation process beyond simple
averaging. As a result, conventional Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp), widely
used to improve communication efficiency in standard FL, is no longer directly
applicable. To overcome this limitation, we design a dedicated AirComp scheme
tailored to Bayesian FL, which efficiently aggregates local posterior
distributions at the distribution level by exploiting the superposition
property of wireless channels. In addition, we derive an optimal transmit power
control strategy, grounded in rigorous convergence analysis, to accelerate
training under power constraints. Our analysis explicitly accounts for
practical wireless impairments such as fading and noise, and provides
theoretical guarantees for convergence. Extensive simulations validate the
proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in test accuracy and
calibration performance over conventional FL methods, particularly in
data-scarce and heterogeneous environments.

care. This document sets out the math behind the spectral-derivatives Python
package. I touch on fundamental signal processing and calculus concepts as
necessary and build upwards.

Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total
power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity
suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback
on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates
have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly
consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a
household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power
for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM
are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire
household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world
smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each
segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper
introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new
subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the
distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only
on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world
datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.
Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's
(Electricit\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed
insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power
consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.

Result: 开发了DeviceScope工具，能够有效检测和定位电器使用模式。

Conclusion: DeviceScope为智能电表数据分析提供了一种实用的解决方案，解决了数据理解难和标记稀缺的问题。

Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart
meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These
meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce
valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint.
However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand
these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a
significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the
aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels
(which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive
to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope,
an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by
detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time
period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance
Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach for appliance localization
that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a
household to be trained. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health
condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is
essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and
self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters
the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to
self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG)
in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant
group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting
disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in
depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area
under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy
from depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups
with and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior
electrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key
contributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures
of depression that may inform future diagnostic tools.

Abstract: The user-centric, cell-free wireless network is a promising next-generation
communication system, but signal synchronization issues arise due to
distributed access points and lack of cellular structure. We propose a novel
method to recover synchronous pilot reception by introducing new pilot
sequences and a matched filter window, enabling orthogonality even with
asynchronous reception. Our approach mimics synchronous transmission by
extending training sequences. Analysis shows asynchronous reception's impact on
channel estimation, and our method significantly improves performance with a
small increase of training time overhead. Results demonstrate a 7.26 dB
reduction in normalized mean square error and 40% increase in data rate,
achieving performance levels comparable to the synchronous case.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于流体天线系统（FAS）的自干扰消除（SIC）框架，通过动态选择无干扰端口有效抑制全双工系统中的环路自干扰，显著提高频谱效率和前向链路速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全双工（IBFD）系统的频谱效率理论上可翻倍，但需有效抑制自干扰（SI）。FAS技术因其固有的干扰抑制能力，成为解决这一问题的理想选择。

Method: 利用接收端FAS动态选择无干扰端口，并在富散射信道中推导了残余自干扰（RSI）功率的下界和近似值。

Result: 仿真显示，RSI功率和前向链路速率验证了分析结果，SIC性能随FAS端口数增加而提升。在实际有限散射和宽带IAB信道条件下，该方法优于传统SIC方案。

Conclusion: FAS辅助SIC框架在高性能和实际场景下均表现出卓越的自干扰抑制能力和显著的前向速率增益。

Abstract: In-band full-duplex (IBFD) systems are expected to double the spectral
efficiency compared to half-duplex systems, provided that loopback
self-interference (SI) can be effectively suppressed. The inherent interference
mitigation capabilities of the emerging fluid antenna system (FAS) technology
make it a promising candidate for addressing the SI challenge in IBFD systems.
This paper thus proposes a FAS-assisted self-interference cancellation (SIC)
framework, which leverages a receiver-side FAS to dynamically select an
interference-free port. Analytical results include a lower bound and an
approximation of the residual SI (RSI) power, both derived for rich-scattering
channels by considering the joint spatial correlation amongst the FAS ports.
Simulations of RSI power and forward link rates validate the analysis, showing
that the SIC performance improves with the number of FAS ports. Additionally,
simulations under practical conditions, such as finite-scattering environments
and wideband integrated access and backhaul (IAB) channels, reveal that the
proposed approach offers superior SIC capability and significant forward rate
gains over conventional IBFD SIC schemes.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned to play a
more important role in future wireless networks. However, the design of ISAC
networks is challenging, especially when there are multiple communication and
sensing (C\&S) nodes and multiple sensing targets. We investigate a multi-base
station (BS) ISAC network in which multiple BSs equipped with multiple antennas
simultaneously provide C\&S services for multiple ground communication users
(CUs) and targets. To enhance the overall performance of C\&S, we formulate a
joint user association (UA) and multi-BS transmit beamforming optimization
problem with the objective of maximizing the total sum rate of all CUs while
ensuring both the minimum target detection and parameter estimation
requirements. To efficiently solve the highly non-convex mixed integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem, we propose an alternating
optimization (AO)-based algorithm that decomposes the problem into two
sub-problems, i.e., UA optimization and multi-BS transmit beamforming
optimization. Inspired by large language models (LLMs) for prediction and
inference, we propose a unified framework integrating LLMs with convex-based
optimization methods. First, we propose a comprehensive design of prompt
engineering, including few-shot, chain of thought, and self-reflection
techniques to guide LLMs in solving the binary integer programming UA
optimization problem. Second, we utilize convex-based optimization methods to
handle the non-convex beamforming optimization problem based on fractional
programming (FP), majorization minimization (MM), and the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) with an optimized UA from LLMs. Numerical results
demonstrate that our proposed LLM-enabled AO-based algorithm achieves fast
convergence and near upper-bound performance with the GPT-o1 model,
outperforming various benchmark schemes.

Abstract: Future wireless systems, known as gigantic multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO), are expected to enhance performance by significantly increasing the
number of antennas, e.g., a few thousands. To enable gigantic MIMO overcoming
the scalability limitations of digital architectures, microwave linear analog
computers (MiLACs) have recently emerged. A MiLAC is a multiport microwave
network that processes input microwave signals entirely in the analog domain,
thereby reducing hardware costs and computational complexity of gigantic MIMO
architectures. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits on the rate
achievable in MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. We model a MIMO system employing
MiLAC-aided beamforming at the transmitter and receiver, and formulate the rate
maximization problem to optimize the microwave networks of the MiLACs, which
are assumed lossless and reciprocal for practical reasons. Under the lossless
and reciprocal constraints, we derive a global optimal solution for the
microwave networks of the MiLACs in closed form. In addition, we also
characterize in closed-form the capacity of MIMO systems operating MiLAC-aided
beamforming. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations,
reveals that MiLAC-aided beamforming achieves the same capacity as digital
beamforming, while significantly reducing the number of radio frequency (RF)
chains, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs)
resolution requirements, and computational complexity.

Abstract: Pinching antennas have emerged as a promising technology for reconfiguring
wireless propagation environments, particularly in high-frequency communication
systems operating in the millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. By enabling
dynamic activation at arbitrary positions along a dielectric waveguide,
pinching antennas offer unprecedented channel reconfigurability and the ability
to provide line-of-sight (LoS) links in scenarios with severe LoS blockages.
The performance of pinching-antenna systems is highly dependent on the
optimized placement of the pinching antennas, which must be jointly considered
with traditional resource allocation (RA) variables -- including transmission
power, time slots, and subcarriers. The resulting joint RA problems are
typically non-convex with complex variable coupling, necessitating
sophisticated optimization techniques. This article provides a comprehensive
survey of existing RA algorithms designed for pinching-antenna systems,
supported by numerical case studies that demonstrate their potential
performance gains. Key challenges and open research problems are also
identified to guide future developments in this emerging field.

Motivation: 传统的线性滤波器在处理非线性问题时存在局限性，需要通过线性化或无迹变换来近似，但仍然是线性估计器。

Method: 通过二次近似最优估计器，保留线性滤波器的结构，但包含测量平方的信息，以提高估计精度。

Result: 数值结果表明，新方法在精度上有显著优势，并可推广到其他线性估计器的二次版本升级。

Conclusion: 提出的二次非线性滤波器在精度上优于传统线性滤波器，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Common filters are usually based on the linear approximation of the optimal
minimum mean square error estimator. The Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters
handle nonlinearity through linearization and unscented transformation,
respectively, but remain linear estimators, meaning that the state estimate is
a linear function of the measurement. This paper proposes a quadratic
approximation of the optimal estimator, creating the Quadratic Extended and
Quadratic Unscented Kalman Filter. These retain the structure of their linear
counterpart, but include information from the measurement square to obtain a
more accurate estimate. Numerical results show the benefits in accuracy of the
new technique, which can be generalized to upgrade other linear estimators to
their quadratic versions.

Conclusion: CO-GNN为IRS-NOMA系统提供高效安全传输方案，简化复杂数学问题，适合动态异构资源配置。

Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) enhance spectral efficiency by
adjusting reflection phase shifts, while Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)
increases system capacity. Consequently, IRS-assisted NOMA communications have
garnered significant research interest. However, the passive nature of the IRS,
lacking authentication and security protocols, makes these systems vulnerable
to external eavesdropping due to the openness of electromagnetic signal
propagation and reflection. NOMA's inherent multi-user signal superposition
also introduces internal eavesdropping risks during user pairing. This paper
investigates secure transmissions in IRS-assisted NOMA systems with
heterogeneous resource configuration in wireless networks to mitigate both
external and internal eavesdropping. To maximize the sum secrecy rate of
legitimate users, we propose a combinatorial optimization graph neural network
(CO-GNN) approach to jointly optimize beamforming at the base station, power
allocation of NOMA users, and phase shifts of IRS for dynamic heterogeneous
resource allocation, thereby enabling the design of dual-link or multi-link
secure transmissions in the presence of eavesdroppers on the same or
heterogeneous links. The CO-GNN algorithm simplifies the complex mathematical
problem-solving process, eliminates the need for channel estimation, and
enhances scalability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm significantly enhances the secure transmission performance of the
system.

Conclusion: 论文表明指纹认证系统在特定攻击下存在漏洞，但通过优化模型可以提升其防御能力，尤其适用于小型卫星星座的保护。

Abstract: As satellite systems become increasingly vulnerable to physical layer attacks
via SDRs, novel countermeasures are being developed to protect critical
systems, particularly those lacking cryptographic protection, or those which
cannot be upgraded to support modern cryptography. Among these is transmitter
fingerprinting, which provides mechanisms by which communication can be
authenticated by looking at characteristics of the transmitter, expressed as
impairments on the signal.
  Previous works show that fingerprinting can be used to classify satellite
transmitters, or authenticate them against SDR-equipped attackers under simple
replay scenarios. In this paper we build upon this by looking at attacks
directly targeting the fingerprinting system, with an attacker optimizing for
maximum impact in jamming, spoofing, and dataset poisoning attacks, and
demonstrate these attacks on the SatIQ system designed to authenticate Iridium
transmitters. We show that an optimized jamming signal can cause a 50% error
rate with attacker-to-victim ratios as low as -30dB (far less power than
traditional jamming) and demonstrate successful identity forgery during
spoofing attacks, with an attacker successfully removing their own
transmitter's fingerprint from messages. We also present a data poisoning
attack, enabling persistent message spoofing by altering the data used to
authenticate incoming messages to include the fingerprint of the attacker's
transmitter.
  Finally, we show that our model trained to optimize spoofing attacks can also
be used to detect spoofing and replay attacks, even when it has never seen the
attacker's transmitter before. Furthermore, this technique works even when the
training dataset includes only a single transmitter, enabling fingerprinting to
be used to protect small constellations and even individual satellites,
providing additional protection where it is needed the most.

Abstract: Inverse-designed nanophotonic devices offer promising solutions for analog
optical computation. High-density photonic integration is critical for scaling
such architectures toward more complex computational tasks and large-scale
applications. Here, we present an inverse-designed photonic neural network
(PNN) accelerator on a high-index contrast material platform, enabling
ultra-compact and energy-efficient optical computing. Our approach introduces a
wave-based inverse-design method based on three dimensional finite-difference
time-domain (3D-FDTD) simulations, exploiting the linearity of Maxwell's
equations to reconstruct arbitrary spatial fields through optical coherence. By
decoupling the forward-pass process into linearly separable simulations, our
approach is highly amenable to computational parallelism, making it
particularly well suited for acceleration using graphics processing units
(GPUs) and other parallel computing platforms, thereby enhancing scalability
across large problem domains. We fabricate and experimentally validate two
inverse-designed PNN accelerators on the silicon-on-insulator platform,
achieving on-chip MNIST and MedNIST classification accuracies of 89% and 90%
respectively, within ultra-compact footprints of just 20 $\times$ 20
$\mu$m$^{2}$ and 30 $\times$ 20 $\mu$m$^{2}$. Our results establish a scalable
and energy-efficient platform for analog photonic computing, effectively
bridging inverse nanophotonic design with high-performance optical information

Abstract: We propose a proximal variable smoothing algorithm for a nonsmooth
optimization problem whose cost function is the sum of three functions
including a weakly convex composite function. The proposed algorithm has a
single-loop structure inspired by a proximal gradient-type method. More
precisely, the proposed algorithm consists of two steps: (i) a gradient descent
of a time-varying smoothed surrogate function designed partially with the
Moreau envelope of the weakly convex function; (ii) an application of the
proximity operator of the remaining function not covered by the smoothed
surrogate function. We also present a convergence analysis of the proposed
algorithm by exploiting a novel asymptotic approximation of a gradient
mapping-type stationarity measure. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in two scenarios: (i) maxmin dispersion
problem and (ii) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) signal detection.
