A fundamental question,\nhowever, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of\nspatial multiplexing in the distance domain?\n  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF\nof a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit\naperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at\nthe same angular direction) but located at different distances from the\ntransmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are\ncontinuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and\ninfinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees\nof freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case\nwhere the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad\nside of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral\noperator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form\nexpression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows\nthat the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the\nextreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We\nfurther extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a\nprojection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent\nbroadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular\narray, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the\nconstraint of the physical length of the array.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fd1\u573a\u5927\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u9635\u5217\u8fb9\u754c\u800c\u975e\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u9635\u5217\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd1\u573a\u5927\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u8fdc\u573a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u89d2\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u540c\u65f6\u670d\u52a1\u591a\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79ef\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5408\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u6b63\u4fa7\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u9635\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u9635\u5217\u8fb9\u754c\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u9635\u5217\u5728\u7269\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u573a\u9635\u5217\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u53d7\u8fb9\u754c\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In\nthis paper, an integrated scheme of uplink (UL) channel estimation and downlink\n(DL) channel prediction is proposed to alleviate channel aging in time division\nduplex (TDD) massive MIMO-OTFS systems. Specifically, first, an iterative basis\nexpansion model (BEM) based UL channel estimation scheme is proposed to\naccurately estimate UL channels with the aid of carefully designed OTFS frame\npattern.

Although the proposed FSA experiences additional\npath-gain attenuation in the received signals, it can overcome several hardware\nand signal processing issues incurred by MAs, such as limited positioning\naccuracy, considerable response latency, and demanding hardware and energy\ncost. To shed useful insights, we first consider a secrecy-guaranteed problem\nwith a null-steering constraint for which maximum ratio transmission (MRT)\nbeamformer is considered at Alice and the frequency offsets are set as uniform\nfrequency increment.

Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing\nthese signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,\nlimiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings\nand acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing\nfoundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a\ngenerative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from\nvast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative\nmulti-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including\nMIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the\ncorresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7\nmillion individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM\nnot only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing\nscenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input\nconfigurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic\ntasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical\noutcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently\noutperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits\nrobust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard\n12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only\nPPG, or a combination thereof is available.

In such a UAV-assisted network, this paper investigates\nposition-based beamforming between ABSs and ground users (GUs). To mitigate\ninter-cell interference, we propose a novel fluid aerial network that leverages\nABS rotation to increase multi-cell capacity and overall network efficiency.\nSpecifically, considering the line-of-sight channel model, the spatial\nbeamforming weights are determined by the orientation angles of the GUs. In\nthis direction, we examine the beamforming gain of a two-dimensional\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array at various ground positions,\nrevealing that ABS rotation significantly affects multi-user channel\ncorrelation and inter-cell interference. Based on these findings, we propose an\nalternative low-complexity algorithm to design the optimal rotation angle for\nABSs, aiming to reduce inter-cell interference and thus maximize the sum rate\nof multi-cell systems. In simulations, exhaustive search serves as a benchmark\nto validate the optimization performance of the proposed sequential ABS\nrotation scheme. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that, in\ninterference-limited regions, the proposed ABS rotation paradigm can\nsignificantly reduce inter-cell interference in terrestrial networks and\nimprove the multi-cell sum rate by approximately 10\\% compared to\nfixed-direction ABSs without rotation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7a7a\u4e2d\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u57fa\u7ad9\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e3a\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6309\u9700\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e94\u6025\u901a\u4fe1\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d41\u4f53\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5c0f\u533a\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4MIMO\u9635\u5217\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u9762\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5c0f\u533a\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u53d7\u9650\u533a\u57df\u5c06\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u603b\u901f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea610%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This work has been\n  submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Vocoders, encoding speech signals into acoustic features and allowing for\nspeech signal reconstruction from them, have been studied for decades.\nRecently, the rise of deep learning has particularly driven the development of\nneural vocoders to generate high-quality speech signals. On the other hand, the\nexisting end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds\nthe speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech,\nresulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and\nresonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying\nspeech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation\nusually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption.\nIn this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech\nas sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process\nto propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech\nsignals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to\nmodel the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the\namplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the\nspeech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting\nand time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network\nsize decrease. The experiments indicate that the proposed method leverages the\nstrengths of QHM, the ARMA model, and neural networks, leading to the\noutperformance of our methods over other methods in terms of generation speed,\nsynthesis quality, and modification flexibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u51c6\u8c10\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\uff08QHM\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u58f0\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u795e\u7ecf\u58f0\u7801\u5668\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u7279\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u795e\u7ecf\u58f0\u7801\u5668\u56e0\u9ed1\u76d2\u7279\u6027\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6e05\u6670\u5c55\u793a\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u7cca\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408QHM\u548cARMA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408QHM\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7f16\u7801\u4e3aARMA\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u5171\u632f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u8c10\u6ce2\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86QHM\u3001ARMA\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u58f0\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In contrast to\nprior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)\napproximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information\nto capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian\nmatrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned\nwhen the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a\nmore reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate\nthe rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a\nquadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in\ngeneral. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular\nfunction maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with\napproximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under\nwhich the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a\nclosed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid\ntheoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational\nefficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,\nalternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank\nbudget constraint.
