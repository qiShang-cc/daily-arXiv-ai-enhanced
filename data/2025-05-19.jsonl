This task becomes particularly challenging with increasing user\nmobility. In this paper, we focus on an uplink scenario in which a massive MIMO\nbase station serves multiple high-mobility users. We leverage variational\nBayesian(VB) inference for joint channel estimation and data detection(JED),\ntailored for time-varying channels. In particular, we use the VB framework to\nprovide approximations of the true posterior distributions. To cover more\nreal-world scenarios, we assume the time correlation coefficients associated\nwith the channels are unknown. Our simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our\nproposed VB-based approach in tracking these unknown time correlation\ncoefficients. We present two processing strategies within the VB framework:\nonline and block processing strategies. The online strategy offers a\nlow-complexity solution for a given time slot, requiring only the knowledge of\nthe parameters/statistics within that time slot. In contrast, the block\nprocessing strategy focuses on the entire communication block and processes all\nreceived signals together to reduce channel estimation errors. Additionally, we\nintroduce an interleaved structure for the online processing strategy to\nfurther enhance its performance. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of\nour VB approach against the linear minimum mean squared error(LMMSE), the\nKalman Filter(KF), and the expectation propagation(EP) methods in terms of\nsymbol error rate(SER) and channel normalized mean squared error(NMSE). Our\nfindings reveal that our VB framework surpasses these benchmarks across the\nperformance metrics."}

This is typically achieved by exploiting the polarimetric\ncovariance or coherence matrix associated with each pixel, which is processed\nto meet a specific goal in Earth observation. This paper presents a design\nframework for selecting the structure of the polarimetric covariance matrix\nthat accurately reflects the symmetry associated with the analyzed pixels. The\nproposed methodology leverages both polarimetric and temporal information from\nmultipass PolSAR images to enhance the retrieval of information from the\nacquired data. To accomplish this, it is assumed that the covariance matrix (of\nthe overall acquired data) is given as the Kronecker product of the temporal\nand polarimetric covariances. An alternating maximization algorithm, known as\nthe flip-flop method, is then developed to estimate both matrices while\nenforcing the symmetry constraint on the polarimetric covariance.
