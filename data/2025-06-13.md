### [1] [Deep Semantic Segmentation for Multi-Source Localization Using Angle of Arrival Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10107)
*Mustafa Atahan Nuhoglu,Hakan Ali Cirpan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的多源定位方法，利用语义分割模型（UNet和UNetPP）处理运动平台上的到达角度测量数据，有效定位静态多源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于单源定位，而动态环境中的多源定位存在显著研究空白，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用UNet和UNetPP作为骨干模型，处理包含平台位置和方向测量线的输入图像，通过分析交点实现多源定位。

Result: 模拟实验显示，该方法在单源定位中与传统方法表现相当，而在高噪声和多源情况下仍能准确定位。

Conclusion: 提出的深度学习框架为动态环境下的多源定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a solution for multi source localization using only angle
of arrival measurements. The receiver platform is in motion, while the sources
are assumed to be stationary. Although numerous methods exist for single source
localization, many relying on pseudo-linear formulations or non convex
optimization techniques, there remains a significant gap in research addressing
multi source localization in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we
propose a deep learning-based framework that leverages semantic segmentation
models for multi source localization. Specifically, we employ UNet and UNetPP
as backbone models, processing input images that encode the platform's
positions along with the corresponding direction finding lines at each
position. By analyzing the intersections of these lines, the models effectively
identify and localize multiple sources. Through simulations, we evaluate both
single- and multi-source localization scenarios. Our results demonstrate that
while the proposed approach performs comparably to traditional methods in
single source localization, it achieves accurate source localization even in
challenging conditions with high noise levels and an increased number of
sources.

### [2] [Quantifying Data Requirements for EEG Independent Component Analysis Using AMICA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10156)
*Gwenevere Frank,Seyed Yahya Shirazi,Jason Palmer,Gert Cauwenberghs,Scott Makeig,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了数据量（帧数）与通道数对独立成分分析（ICA）分解质量的影响，发现增加数据量能持续提升分解质量，未观察到明显的平台期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨数据量与通道数对ICA分解质量的影响，以优化EEG数据处理。

Method: 使用AMICA算法在71通道数据集上随机子采样，评估不同数据量下的分解质量（MIR和近双极性）。

Result: 随数据量增加，MIR和近双极性均呈上升趋势，但未观察到平台期，表明增加数据量会持续提升质量。

Conclusion: 收集更多EEG数据可能超出常规阈值，继续提升分解质量。

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an important step in EEG processing
for a wide-ranging set of applications. However, ICA requires well-designed
studies and data collection practices to yield optimal results. Past studies
have focused on quantitative evaluation of the differences in quality produced
by different ICA algorithms as well as different configurations of parameters
for AMICA, a multimodal ICA algorithm that is considered the benchmark against
which other algorithms are measured. Here, the effect of the data quantity
versus the number of channels on decomposition quality is explored. AMICA
decompositions were run on a 71 channel dataset with 13 subjects while randomly
subsampling data to correspond to specific ratios of the number of frames in a
dataset to the channel count. Decomposition quality was evaluated for the
varying quantities of data using measures of mutual information reduction (MIR)
and the near dipolarity of components. We also note that an asymptotic trend
can be seen in the increase of MIR and a general increasing trend in near
dipolarity with increasing data, but no definitive plateau in these metrics was
observed, suggesting that the benefits of collecting additional EEG data may
extend beyond common heuristic thresholds and continue to enhance decomposition
quality.

### [3] [Intelligent Travel Activity Monitoring: Generalized Distributed Acoustic Sensing Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10237)
*Ruikang Zhong,Chia-Yen Chiang,Mona Jaber,Rupert De Wilde,Peter Hayward*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的分布式声学感知系统（DAS），用于监测步行、骑行等活动，解决了隐私和通用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为可持续交通系统提供准确、经济、隐私保护且通用的活动监测方案。

Method: 利用DAS捕捉环境振动，结合深度学习技术；提出两种解决方案（基于联邦学习的IoT方案和基于元学习的离线初始化方法）。

Result: 实验验证了系统在步行和骑行分类中的性能和通用性。

Conclusion: 该系统为大规模监测主动出行活动提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Obtaining data on active travel activities such as walking, jogging, and
cycling is important for refining sustainable transportation systems (STS).
Effectively monitoring these activities not only requires sensing solutions to
have a joint feature of being accurate, economical, and privacy-preserving, but
also enough generalizability to adapt to different climate environments and
deployment conditions. In order to provide a generalized sensing solution, a
deep learning (DL)-enhanced distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system for
monitoring active travel activities is proposed. By leveraging the ambient
vibrations captured by DAS, this scheme infers motion patterns without relying
on image-based or wearable devices, thereby addressing privacy concerns. We
conduct real-world experiments in two geographically distinct locations and
collect comprehensive datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed
system. To address the generalization challenges posed by heterogeneous
deployment environments, we propose two solutions according to network
availability: 1) an Internet-of-Things (IoT) scheme based on federated learning
(FL) is proposed, and it enables geographically different DAS nodes to be
trained collaboratively to improve generalizability; 2) an off-line
initialization approach enabled by meta-learning is proposed to develop
high-generality initialization for DL models and to enable rapid model
fine-tuning with limited data samples, facilitating generalization at newly
established or isolated DAS nodes. Experimental results of the walking and
cycling classification problem demonstrate the performance and generalizability
of the proposed DL-enhanced DAS system, paving the way for practical,
large-scale DAS monitoring of active travel.

### [4] [Ground Reaction Force Estimation via Time-aware Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10265)
*Eun Som Jeon,Sinjini Mitra,Jisoo Lee,Omik M. Save,Ankita Shukla,Hyunglae Lee,Pavan Turaga*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间感知的知识蒸馏框架，用于从鞋垫传感器数据中估计地面反作用力（GRF），解决了便携式传感器噪声多且不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面反作用力（GRF）是步行中身体与地面交互的重要指标，但传统设备（如跑步机）成本高且不便携，而便携式鞋垫传感器又不够准确。

Method: 采用时间感知的知识蒸馏框架，利用小批量数据中的相似性和时间特征，捕捉目标与输入数据的互补关系及序列特性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在GRF估计上优于现有基线，且轻量化模型表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为便携式GRF测量提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

### [5] [Heterogeneous-IRS-Assisted MIMO Systems: Channel Estimation and Beamforming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10350)
*Weibiao Zhao,Qiucen Wu,Yuanqi Tang,Yu Zhu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型智能反射面结构HE-IRS，通过结合动态和静态可调元件，在优化性能和功耗的同时，解决了信道估计和波束形成的新挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规IRS功耗高，需要一种绿色结构来平衡性能和功耗，同时应对由此带来的新问题。

Method: 采用分解信道估计方法，结合稀疏性和流形优化，提出高效信道估计方案和鲁棒秩选择规则；波束形成则分在线优化和离线优化。

Result: HE-IRS比常规IRS减少导频开销，功耗显著降低的同时保持竞争力总和速率性能。

Conclusion: HE-IRS是一种有效的绿色IRS解决方案，适用于多用户MIMO系统。

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has gained great attention for its
ability to create favorable propagation environments. However, the power
consumption of conventional IRSs cannot be ignored due to the large number of
reflecting elements and control circuits. To balance performance and power
consumption, we previously proposed a heterogeneous-IRS (HE-IRS), a green IRS
structure integrating dynamically tunable elements (DTEs) and statically
tunable elements (STEs). Compared to conventional IRSs with only DTEs, the
unique DTE-STE integrated structure introduces new challenges in both channel
estimation and beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the channel
estimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel
estimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated
is decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent
channel. Leveraging it along with the inherent sparsity of DTE- and STE-based
channels and manifold optimization, we propose an efficient channel estimation
scheme. To address the rank mismatch problem in the imperfect channel sparsity
information, a robust rank selection rule is developed. For beamforming, we
propose an offline algorithm to optimize the STE phase shifts for wide beam
coverage, and an online algorithm to optimize the BS precoder and the DTE phase
shifts using the estimated HE-IRS channel. Simulation results show that the
HE-IRS requires less pilot overhead than conventional IRSs with the same number
of elements. With the proposed channel estimation and beamforming schemes, the
green HE-IRS achieves competitive sum rate performance with significantly
reduced power consumption.

### [6] [Relaxation-Free Min-k-Partition for PCI Assignment in 5G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10362)
*Yeqing Qiu,Chengpiao Huang,Ye Xue,Zhipeng Jiang,Qingjiang Shi,Dong Zhang,Zhi-Quan Luo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的物理小区标识（PCI）分配框架，通过分解问题和采用中国剩余定理，显著提高了5G网络的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCI分配对5G网络的可靠性和用户体验至关重要，现有方法在效率和干扰解决方面存在不足。

Method: 将问题分解为Min-3-Partition、Min-10-Partition和图着色问题，采用无松弛的二次规划方法，并结合惩罚镜像下降算法。

Result: 方法在计算效率和可扩展性上优于现有技术，减少了干扰并消除了碰撞和混淆，计算时间减少最多20倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在大型5G网络中具有实际应用潜力，能够提升网络性能并降低部署成本。

Abstract: Physical Cell Identity (PCI) is a critical parameter in 5G networks.
Efficient and accurate PCI assignment is essential for mitigating mod-3
interference, mod-30 interference, collisions, and confusions among cells,
which directly affect network reliability and user experience. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework for PCI assignment by decomposing the problem into
Min-3-Partition, Min-10-Partition, and a graph coloring problem, leveraging the
Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Furthermore, we develop a relaxation-free
approach to the general Min-$k$-Partition problem by reformulating it as a
quadratic program with a norm-equality constraint and solving it using a
penalized mirror descent (PMD) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates
superior computational efficiency and scalability, significantly reducing
interference while eliminating collisions and confusions in large-scale 5G
networks. Numerical evaluations on real-world datasets show that our approach
reduces computational time by up to 20 times compared to state-of-the-art
methods, making it highly practical for real-time PCI optimization in
large-scale networks. These results highlight the potential of our method to
improve network performance and reduce deployment costs in modern 5G systems.

### [7] [A Neural Network-aided Low Complexity Chase Decoder for URLLC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10513)
*Enrico Testi,Enrico Paolini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合神经网络预测的增强型 Chase-II 解码算法，用于提升超可靠低延迟通信（URLLC）的解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码算法在 URLLC 短块长度场景下难以同时满足高可靠性和低复杂度的需求。

Method: 通过神经网络预测有效扰动模式，减少了 Chase-II 解码算法的尝试次数。

Result: 结合了准最大似然解码的可靠性和神经网络推断的高效性。

Conclusion: 该算法适合时间敏感且资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand decoding algorithms
that simultaneously offer high reliability and low complexity under stringent
latency constraints. While iterative decoding schemes for LDPC and Polar codes
offer a good compromise between performance and complexity, they fall short in
approaching the theoretical performance limits in the typical URLLC short block
length regime. Conversely, quasi-ML decoding schemes for algebraic codes, like
Chase-II decoding, exhibit a smaller gap to optimum decoding but are
computationally prohibitive for practical deployment in URLLC systems. To
bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced Chase-II decoding algorithm that
leverages a neural network (NN) to predict promising perturbation patterns,
drastically reducing the number of required decoding trials. The proposed
approach combines the reliability of quasi-ML decoding with the efficiency of
NN inference, making it well-suited for time-sensitive and resource-constrained
applications.

Abstract: In this letter, a pinching antennas (PAs) assisted rate splitting multiple
access (RSMA) system with multiple waveguides is investigated to maximize sum
rate. A two-step algorithm is proposed to determine PA activation scheme and
optimize the waveguide beamforming. Specifically, a low complexity spatial
correlation and distance based method is proposed for PA activation selection.
After determining the PA activation status, a semi-definite programming (SDP)
based successive convex approximation (SCA) is leveraged to obtain the optimal
waveguide beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed multiple
waveguides based PAs assisted RSMA method achieves better performance than
various benchmarking schemes.

### [9] [Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10662)
*George C. Alexandropoulos,Konstantinos D. Katsanos,Evangelos Vlachos*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本章提出了一种半被动可重构智能表面（RIS）的硬件架构，用于提升多输入多输出（MIMO）通信系统的性能，并介绍了一种基于ADMM的通道估计算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过RIS的硬件架构和通道估计优化，提升MIMO系统的性能，尤其是在高频段（FR3及以上）的应用。

Result: 数值实验表明，提出的通道估计技术优于基准方案，且动态优化RIS反射系数能有效提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 该RIS架构和通道估计算法在高频MIMO系统中展现出显著优势，为未来通信系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration
for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple
radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase
profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller
encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and
consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel
channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal
training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable
absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its
signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly
used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase
configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation
algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the
entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank
properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for
communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical
investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation
technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware
configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel
estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized
reflection coefficients of its unit elements.

Conclusion: 提出的传感器处理流程在小距离和高速度场景中表现优异，为可穿戴技术提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wearable technologies, such as AR glasses, demands
compact, energy-efficient sensors capable of high-precision measurements in
dynamic environments. Traditional Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW)
Laser Feedback Interferometry (LFI) sensors, while promising, falter in
applications that feature small distances, high velocities, shallow modulation,
and low-power constraints. We propose a novel sensor-processing pipeline that
reliably extracts distance and velocity measurements at distances as low as 1
cm. As a core contribution, we introduce a four-ramp modulation scheme that
resolves persistent ambiguities in beat frequency signs and overcomes spectral
blind regions caused by hardware limitations. Based on measurements of the
implemented pipeline, a noise model is defined to evaluate its performance and
sensitivity to several algorithmic and working point parameters. We show that
the pipeline generally achieves robust and low-noise measurements using
state-of-the-art hardware.

### [11] [Automotive Radar Online Channel Imbalance Estimation via NLMS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10841)
*Esmaeil Kavousi Ghafi,Oliver Lang,Matthias Wagner,Alexander Melzer,Mario Huemer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于NLMS算法的在线方法，用于估计汽车雷达中的通道不平衡问题，具有低计算复杂度和快速更新率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车雷达通道不平衡可能导致安全风险，需要一种高效的在线监测方法。

Result: 方法在仿真和实测中表现良好，支持多目标场景。

Conclusion: 新方法优于现有技术，适用于雷达的并行运行。

Abstract: Automotive radars are one of the essential enablers of advanced driver
assistance systems (ADASs). Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and
reliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents
and increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this
context is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the
reliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter
variations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may
affect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In
this work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel
imbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean
squares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to
estimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected
targets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior
knowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in
combination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed
method suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the
normal operation of the radar. Furthermore, it features reduced dependency on
specific targets of interest and faster update rates of the channel imbalance
estimation compared to the majority of state-of-the-art methods. This
improvement is achieved by allowing for multiple targets in the angular
spectrum, whereas most other methods are restricted to only single targets in
the angular spectrum. The performance of the proposed method is validated using
various simulation scenarios and is supported by measurement results.

### [12] [Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration with Structural Nonparametric Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10813)
*Hang Zhang,Xiang Chen,Renjiu Hu,Rongguang Wang,Jinwei Zhang,Min Liu,Yaonan Wang,Gaolei Li,Xinxing Cheng,Jinming Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SmoothProper的神经网络模块，用于解决稀疏特征图像的形变配准问题，通过优化层和交互项实现平滑性和结构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决稀疏特征图像在形变配准中的大位移和孔径问题，传统无监督方法表现不佳，需要一种新方法来提升配准效果。

Method: 引入SmoothProper模块，结合基于对偶的优化层和定制交互项，在网络前向传播中传递流信号并强制平滑性。

Result: 在视网膜血管数据集上，该方法将配准误差降低至1.88像素，首次有效解决了大位移和孔径问题。

Conclusion: SmoothPrope是一种模型无关、即插即用的模块，无需调整超参数，显著提升了形变配准的性能。

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at
https://github.com/tinymilky/SmoothProper.

*Shubham Srivastava,Adrish Banerjee*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: DeepPolar+通过创新架构和优化策略解决了DeepPolar代码的BER-BLER权衡问题，同时提升了误码率和块错误率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DeepPolar码在误码率（BER）表现优异，但块错误率（BLER）不佳，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入注意力增强解码器、结构化损失函数和自适应SNR匹配冗余技术（SMART）来优化BER和BLER。

Result: 在(256,37)码配置下，DeepPolar+显著提升了BER和BLER性能，并加快了收敛速度。

Conclusion: DeepPolar+填补了神经极性码理论与实际应用的差距，为下一代纠错系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: DeepPolar codes have recently emerged as a promising approach for channel
coding, demonstrating superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to
conventional polar codes. Despite their excellent BER characteristics, these
codes exhibit suboptimal block error rate (BLER) performance, creating a
fundamental BER-BLER trade-off that severely limits their practical deployment
in communication systems. This paper introduces DeepPolar+, an enhanced neural
polar coding framework that systematically eliminates this BER-BLER trade-off
by simultaneously improving BLER performance while maintaining the superior BER
characteristics of DeepPolar codes. Our approach achieves this breakthrough
through three key innovations: (1) an attention-enhanced decoder architecture
that leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture complex
dependencies between bit positions, (2) a structured loss function that jointly
optimizes for both bit-level accuracy and block-level reliability, and (3) an
adaptive SNR-Matched Redundancy Technique (SMART) for decoding DeepPolar+ code
(DP+SMART decoder) that combines specialized models with CRC verification for
robust performance across diverse channel conditions. For a (256,37) code
configuration, DeepPolar+ demonstrates notable improvements in both BER and
BLER performance compared to conventional successive cancellation decoding and
DeepPolar, while achieving remarkably faster convergence through improved
architecture and optimization strategies. The DeepPolar+SMART variant further
amplifies these dual improvements, delivering significant gains in both error
rate metrics over existing approaches. DeepPolar+ effectively bridges the gap
between theoretical potential and practical implementation of neural polar
codes, offering a viable path forward for next-generation error correction
systems.

### [14] [Anomaly Detection for Sensing Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10718)
*Stefan Roth,Aydin Sezgin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了物理层安全中的异常检测方法，改进了现有算法以适应不同环境需求，并通过案例研究验证了这些方法的有效性，同时指出了当前防御措施的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决物理层安全中异常检测的需求，特别是在不同环境下需要轻量计算、抗温度变化和抗相位噪声的稳健方法。

Method: 研究采用了移动平均滤波、自回归滤波和卡尔曼滤波来预测满足条件的特征向量，并设计了不同的假设测试来实现多方向离群值检测。

Result: 在案例研究中，基于商用WiFi设备的算法与信道特征组合在运动检测攻击中表现出有效性，同时发现仅依赖发射功率随机化的防御措施不足。

Conclusion: 研究表明，频率变异随机化可能是更有效的防御方式，尤其是在攻击者能够获取信道状态信息的情况下。

Abstract: Various approaches in the field of physical layer security involve anomaly
detection, such as physical layer authentication, sensing attacks, and
anti-tampering solutions. Depending on the context in which these approaches
are applied, anomaly detection needs to be computationally lightweight,
resilient to changes in temperature and environment, and robust against phase
noise. We adapt moving average filters, autoregression filters and Kalman
filters to provide predictions of feature vectors that fulfill the above
criteria. Different hypothesis test designs are employed that allow
omnidirectional and unidirectional outlier detection. In a case study, a
sensing attack is investigated that employs the described algorithms with
various channel features based on commodity WiFi devices. Thereby, various
combinations of algorithms and channel features show effectiveness for motion
detection by an attacker. Countermeasures only utilizing transmit power
randomization are shown insufficient to mitigate such attacks if the attacker
has access to channel state information (CSI) measurements, suggesting that
mitigation solutions might require frequency-variant randomization.

comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of wireless networks has resulted in numerous
challenges stemming from their extensive demands for quality of service towards
innovative quality of experience metrics (e.g., user-defined metrics in terms
of sense of physical experience for haptics applications). In the meantime,
large language models (LLMs) emerged as promising solutions for many difficult
and complex applications/tasks. These lead to a notion of the integration of
LLMs and wireless networks. However, this integration is challenging and needs
careful attention in design. Therefore, in this article, we present a notion of
rational wireless networks powered by \emph{telecom LLMs}, namely,
\emph{LLM-native wireless systems}. We provide fundamentals, vision, and a case
study of the distributed implementation of LLM-native wireless systems. In the
case study, we propose a solution based on double deep Q-learning (DDQN) that
outperforms existing DDQN solutions. Finally, we provide open challenges.

Abstract: The increasing demand for reliable, high-capacity communication during
large-scale outdoor events poses significant challenges for traditional
Terrestrial Networks (TNs), which often struggle to provide consistent coverage
in high-density environments. This paper presents a novel 6G radio network
planning framework that integrates Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to deliver ubiquitous coverage and
enhanced network capacity. Our framework overcomes the limitations of
conventional deployable base stations by leveraging NTN architectures,
including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and passive RIS platforms seamlessly
integrated with Beyond 5G (B5G) TNs. By incorporating advanced B5G technologies
such as Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and beamforming, and by
optimizing spectrum utilization across the C, S, and Ka bands, we implement a
rigorous interference management strategy based on a dynamic SINR model.
Comprehensive calculations and simulations validate the proposed framework,
demonstrating significant improvements in connectivity, reliability, and
cost-efficiency in crowded scenarios. This integration strategy represents a
promising solution for meeting the evolving demands of future 6G networks.
