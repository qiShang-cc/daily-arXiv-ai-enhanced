Among these, quadruped robots with\nmanipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.\nHowever, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of\nintegrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic\narm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.\nTeleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high\nlevel of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load\non the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that\ndirectly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler\nand more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by\nleveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external\ncamera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist\nposition. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to\ncontrol the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe\nteleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and\nthe robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,\ndemonstrating robust performance in real-time control.

To investigate their capabilities, we\nstudy the sum rate maximization problem in an SIM-based multiuser (MU)\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system. A vast majority of pioneer\nstudies, if not all, address this fundamental problem using the prevailing\nalternating optimization (AO) framework, where the digital beamforming (DB) and\nSIM phase shifts are optimized alternately. However, many of these approaches\nsuffer from suboptimal performance, quickly leading to performance saturation,\nwhen the number of SIM layers increases assuming the \\emph{fixed SIM\nthickness}. In this letter, we demonstrate that significant performance gains\ncan still be achieved, and such saturation does not occur with the proposed\nmethod in the considered setting. To this end, we provide practical design\nguidelines to improve AO-based optimization of digital precoders and SIM phase\nshifts. Specifically, we show that (i) optimizing the SIM phase shifts first\nyields significant performance improvements, compared to optimizing the DB\nfirst; and (ii) when applying projected gradient (PG) methods, which are\ngradually becoming more popular to optimize the phase shifts thanks to their\nscalability, we find that using an iterative PG method achieves better\nperformance than the single PG step, which is commonly used in existing\nsolutions.

To complement this, we conceptualize in this study a novel\nspace-air-ground-underground integrated network (SAGUIN) architecture that\nseamlessly incorporates satellite systems, aerial platforms, terrestrial\nnetworks, and underground communications. On this basis, we integrate LoRaWAN\nand wireless energy transfer (WET) technologies into SAGUIN to enable\nsustainable subterranean mMTC.

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range\nof challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can\nalready noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional\nsupervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical\npoints in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes\nleads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our\nperturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success\nrate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger\nmanipulation."}

Self-supervised contrastive learning has\nemerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from\nunlabeled signals.

We validate our approach through extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate\nthat poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional\ntwo-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher\nAUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to\nfour times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock\npre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we\nachieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total\ncomputation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.\nThrough extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate\nrobustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window\ncontrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated\nECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised\nrepresentation learning in biomedical time-series data."}

The\nproposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution,\nand the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform\nconstellation (NUC), and the latter decreases the number of signal points\nwithout compromising the achievable bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Since\nthe proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only the two parameters,\neach associated with NUC and cardinality, the complexity required for the\nnumerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the\nconstellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation\n(PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM\nreceiver.
