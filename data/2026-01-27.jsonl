This shortcoming has recently been addressed with the advent of waveform measurement units (WMUs), which provide high-resolution, time-synchronized raw voltage and current waveform samples from multiple locations in the power system. However, transient model learning based on synchro-waveform measurements remains constrained by the scarcity of network disturbances and the complexity of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of IBRs. We propose to address these problems by developing a data-efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework for synchro-waveform analytics that estimates the IBR terminal current response from only a few network disturbance signatures. Here, the physics of the electrical circuits are used to compensate for limited data availability by constraining the learning process through known circuit relationships. Two cases are considered, with known and unknown circuit parameters. In the latter case, the framework jointly learns the transient dynamics of the IBRs and the parameters of the electrical circuit. Case studies using WMU disturbance data across multiple sampling rates shows consistently lower current estimation error with substantially fewer training events than a purely data-driven baseline."}

This model is also leveraged to formulate an RIS-based spoofing design with the dual objective to enforce strict nulls around the UE's true reflection AoA and maximize the channel gain towards a decoy direction. The RIS's deception capability is quantified using point-wise and angle-range robust criteria, and a configuration-independent placement score guiding decoy selection is proposed.

Cooperative multi-task SemCom (CMT-SemCom) further improves task execution performance. However, [1] demonstrates that cooperative multi-tasking can be either constructive or destructive. Moreover, the existing CMT-SemCom framework is not directly applicable to distributed multi-user scenarios, such as non-terrestrial satellite networks, where each satellite employs an individual semantic encoder. In this paper, we extend our earlier CMT-SemCom framework to distributed settings by proposing a federated learning (FL) based CMT-SemCom that enables cooperative multi-tasking across distributed users. Moreover, to address performance degradation caused by negative information transfer among heterogeneous tasks, we propose a semantic-aware task clustering method integrated in the FL process to ensure constructive cooperation based on an information-theoretic approach. Unlike common clustering methods that rely on high-dimensional data or feature space similarity, our proposed approach operates in the low-dimensional semantic domain to identify meaningful task relationships. Simulation results based on a LEO satellite network setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and performance gain over unclustered FL and individual single-task SemCom."}

The tool's flexibility enables ergonomic risk assessment using any system capable of reliably measuring joint angles, extending the applicability of RULA beyond proprietary setups. To validate its performance, the tool was tested in an industrial setting during the assembly of conveyor belts, which involved high-risk tasks such as inserting rods and pushing conveyor belt components.

While robotic automation offers solutions, construction robots struggle to adapt to unstructured, dynamic sites. Central to this is improvisation, adapting to unexpected situations through creative problem-solving, which remains predominantly human. In construction's unpredictable environments, collaborative human-robot improvisation is essential for workflow continuity. This research develops a six-level taxonomy classifying human-robot collaboration (HRC) based on improvisation capabilities. Through systematic review of 214 articles (2010-2025), we categorize construction robotics across: Manual Work (Level 0), Human-Controlled Execution (Level 1), Adaptive Manipulation (Level 2), Imitation Learning (Level 3), Human-in-Loop BIM Workflow (Level 4), Cloud-Based Knowledge Integration (Level 5), and True Collaborative Improvisation (Level 6). Analysis reveals current research concentrates at lower levels, with critical gaps in experiential learning and limited progression toward collaborative improvisation. A five-dimensional radar framework illustrates progressive evolution of Planning, Cognitive Role, Physical Execution, Learning Capability, and Improvisation, demonstrating how complementary human-robot capabilities create team performance exceeding individual contributions. The research identifies three fundamental barriers: technical limitations in grounding and dialogic reasoning, conceptual gaps between human improvisation and robotics research, and methodological challenges. We recommend future research emphasizing improved human-robot communication via Augmented/Virtual Reality interfaces, large language model integration, and cloud-based knowledge systems to advance toward true collaborative improvisation."}

Falls are among the most critical events to monitor due to their timely response requirement, yet frequent false alarms or uncertain detections can overwhelm caregivers and contribute to alarm fatigue. This motivates the design of reliable, whole end-to-end ambient monitoring systems from occupancy and activity awareness to fall and post-fall detection. In this paper, we focus on robust post-fall floor-occupancy detection using an off-the-shelf 60 GHz FMCW radar and evaluate its deployment in a realistic, furnished indoor environment representative of LTC facilities. Post-fall detection is challenging since motion is minimal, and reflections from the floor and surrounding objects can dominate the radar signal return. We compare a vendor-provided digital beamforming (DBF) pipeline against a proposed preprocessing approach based on Capon or minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming. A cell-averaging constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector is applied and evaluated on the resulting range-azimuth maps across 7 participants. The proposed method improves the mean frame-positive rate from 0.823 (DBF) to 0.916 (Proposed)."}

Yet detecting quasi-static presence (lying, sitting, or standing with only subtle micro-motions) is difficult for low-resolution SIMO FMCW radar because near-zero Doppler energy is often buried under static clutter. We present Respiratory-Amplification Semi-Static Occupancy (RASSO), an invertible Doppler-domain non-linear remapping that densifies the slow-time FFT (Doppler) grid around 0 m/s before adaptive Capon beamforming. The resulting range-azimuth (RA) maps exhibit higher effective SNR, sharper target peaks, and lower background variance, making thresholding and learning more reliable. On a real nursing-home dataset collected with a short-range 1Tx-3Rx radar, RASSO-RA improves classical detection performance, achieving AUC = 0.981 and recall = 0.920/0.947 at FAR = 1%/5%, outperforming conventional Capon processing and a recent baseline. RASSO-RA also benefits data-driven models: a frame-based CNN reaches 95-99% accuracy and a sequence-based CNN-LSTM reaches 99.4-99.6% accuracy across subjects. A paired session-level bootstrap test confirms statistically significant macro-F1 gains of 2.6-3.6 points (95% confidence intervals above zero) over the non-warped pipeline. These results show that simple Doppler-domain warping before spatial processing can materially improve semi-static occupancy detection with low-resolution radar in real clinical environments."}

In this work, we present the quantitative evaluation of ergonomics and comfort of the Elevate suit - a cable driven soft robotic suit that assists shoulder elevation. Using a motion-capture system and force sensors, we measured the suit's ergonomics during assisted shoulder elevation up to 70 degrees. Two 4-hour sessions were conducted with one subject, involving transmitting cable tensions of up to 200N with no discomfort reported. We estimated that the pressure applied to the shoulder during assisted movements was within the range seen in a human grasp (approximately 69.1-85.1kPa), and estimated volumetric compression of <3% and <8% across the torso and upper arm, respectively. These results provide early validation of Elevate's ergonomic design in preparation for future studies with patient groups."}

To address these issues, we propose a sensitivity-aware model division multiple access (S-MDMA) framework tailored for bandwidth-limited multi-user scenarios. The proposed framework first performs semantic extraction and merging based on the MDMA architecture to consolidate redundant information. To further improve transmission efficiency, a semantic sensitivity sorting algorithm is presented, which can selectively retain key semantic features.

However, it still faces limitations when scaling to complex, wide-ranging task spaces. Such task spaces often lack a well-defined difficulty structure, making the difficulty ordering required by previous methods challenging to define. We propose a Learning Progress-based Automatic Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (LP-ACRL) framework, which estimates the agent's learning progress online and adaptively adjusts the task-sampling distribution, thereby enabling automatic curriculum generation without prior knowledge of the difficulty distribution over the task space. Policies trained with LP-ACRL enable the ANYmal D quadruped to achieve and maintain stable, high-speed locomotion at 2.5 m/s linear velocity and 3.0 rad/s angular velocity across diverse terrains, including stairs, slopes, gravel, and low-friction flat surfaces--whereas previous methods have generally been limited to high speeds on flat terrain or low speeds on complex terrain. Experimental results demonstrate that LP-ACRL exhibits strong scalability and real-world applicability, providing a robust baseline for future research on curriculum generation in complex, wide-ranging robotic learning task spaces."}

In this paper, we investigate the use of MAs for two typical near-field beamforming scenarios: beam nulling and multi-beam forming. In the first scenario, we aim to jointly optimize the positions of multiple MAs and the beamforming vector to maximize the beam gain toward a desired direction while nulling interference toward multiple undesired directions. In the second scenario, the objective is to maximize the minimum beam gain among all the above directions. However, both problems are non-convex and challenging to solve optimally. To gain insights, we first analyze several special cases and show that, with proper positioning of the MAs, directing the beam toward a specific direction can lead to nulls or full gains in other directions in the two scenarios, respectively. For the general cases, we propose a discrete sampling method and an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions to the two formulated problems. Furthermore, considering the practical limitations in antenna positioning accuracy, we analyze the impact of position errors on the performance of the optimized beamforming and MA positions, by introducing a Taylor series approximation for the near-field beam gain at each target. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms."}

To enhance terrain awareness and ensure precise foot placement, we design a cross-modal context encoder that fuses prediction-based proprioceptive features with attention-based perceptive representations.

However, point cloud-based policies remain highly sensitive to sensor noise, pose perturbations, and occlusion-induced artifacts, which distort geometric structure and break the equivariance assumptions required for robust generalization. Existing equivariant approaches primarily encode symmetry constraints into neural architectures, but do not explicitly correct noise-induced geometric deviations or enforce equivariant consistency in learned representations. We introduce EquiForm, a noise-robust SE(3)-equivariant policy learning framework for point cloud-based manipulation. EquiForm formalizes how noise-induced geometric distortions lead to equivariance deviations in observation-to-action mappings, and introduces a geometric denoising module to restore consistent 3D structure under noisy or incomplete observations. In addition, we propose a contrastive equivariant alignment objective that enforces representation consistency under both rigid transformations and noise perturbations. Built upon these components, EquiForm forms a flexible policy learning pipeline that integrates noise-robust geometric reasoning with modern generative models. We evaluate EquiForm on 16 simulated tasks and 4 real-world manipulation tasks across diverse objects and scene layouts. Compared to state-of-the-art point cloud imitation learning methods, EquiForm achieves an average improvement of 17.2% in simulation and 28.1% in real-world experiments, demonstrating strong noise robustness and spatial generalization."}

A non-orthogonal pilot transmission scheme is considered to accommodate a larger number of users that can be supported by ELAA systems without incurring an excessive amount of training overhead. To facilitate efficient multi-user channel estimation, we express the received signal as a third-order low-rank tensor, which admits a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) model for line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios and a block term decomposition (BTD) model for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. An alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm and a non-linear least squares (NLS) algorithm are employed to perform CPD and BTD, respectively. Channel parameters are then efficiently extracted from the recovered factor matrices. By exploiting the geometry of the propagation paths in the estimated channel, users' positions can be precisely determined in LoS scenarios. Moreover, our uniqueness analysis shows that the proposed tensor-based joint multi-user channel estimation framework is effective even when the number of pilot symbols is much smaller than the number of users, revealing its potential in training overhead reduction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves markedly higher channel estimation accuracy than compressed sensing (CS)-based approaches."}

In this paper, we present an autonomous aerial robot for navigation in the dark by combining an Infra-Red (IR) monocular camera with a large-aperture coded lens and structured light without external infrastructure like GPS or motion-capture. Our approach obtains depth-dependent defocus cues (each structured light point appears as a pattern that is depth dependent), which acts as a strong prior for our AsterNet deep depth estimation model. The model is trained in simulation by generating data using a simple optical model and transfers directly to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining. AsterNet runs onboard the robot at 20 Hz on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin$^\\text{TM}$ Nano. Furthermore, our network is robust to changes in the structured light pattern and relative placement of the pattern emitter and IR camera, leading to simplified and cost-effective construction. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate our proposed depth navigation approach AsterNav using depth from AsterNet in many real-world experiments using only onboard sensing and computation, including dark matte obstacles and thin ropes (diameter 6.25mm), achieving an overall success rate of 95.5% with unknown object shapes, locations and materials.

Traditional Channel Charting (CC) methods map high-dimensional CSI data to low-dimensional spaces to help reveal the geometric structure of wireless channels. However, most existing CC methods focus on learning static geometric structures and ignore the dynamic nature of the channel over time, leading to instability and poor topological consistency of the channel charting in complex environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel time-series channel charting approach based on the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Auto encoders (AE) (LSTM-AE-CC). This method incorporates a temporal modeling mechanism into the traditional CC framework, capturing temporal dependencies in CSI using LSTM and learning continuous latent representations with AE. The proposed method ensures both geometric consistency of the channel and explicit modeling of the time-varying properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional CC methods in various real-world communication scenarios, particularly in terms of channel charting stability, trajectory continuity, and long-term predictability."}

While deep neural networks have been successfully used for vision-based tasks, they inherently lack provable guarantees on the correctness of their output, which is crucial for safety-critical applications. We present a framework for designing certifiable neural networks (NNs) for perception-based pose estimation that integrates physics-driven modeling with learning-based estimation. The proposed framework begins by leveraging the known geometry of planar objects commonly found in the environment, such as traffic signs and runway markings, referred to as target objects. At its core, it introduces a geometric generative model (GGM), a neural-network-like model whose parameters are derived from the image formation process of a target object observed by a camera. Once designed, the GGM can be used to train NN-based pose estimators with certified guarantees in terms of their estimation errors. We first demonstrate this framework in uncluttered environments, where the target object is the only object present in the camera's field of view. We extend this using ideas from NN reachability analysis to design certified object NN that can detect the presence of the target object in cluttered environments. Subsequently, the framework consolidates the certified object detector with the certified pose estimator to design a multi-stage perception pipeline that generalizes the proposed approach to cluttered environments, while maintaining its certified guarantees. We evaluate the proposed framework using both synthetic and real images of various planar objects commonly encountered by autonomous vehicles. Using images captured by an event-based camera, we show that the trained encoder can effectively estimate the pose of a traffic sign in accordance with the certified bound provided by the framework."}

This paper introduces a point-spread-function (PSF)-centric framework for dual-band OFDM delay estimation. We model the observed delay profile as the convolution of the true target response with a PSF determined by the dual-band subcarrier selection pattern, explicitly linking band configuration to resolution and ambiguity. To suppress PSF-induced artifacts, we adapt the RELAX algorithm for dual-band multi-target delay estimation. Simulations demonstrate improved robustness and accuracy in dual-band scenarios, supporting ILC under fragmented spectrum."}

Conventional stiffness estimation methods, which neglect delay, suffer from temporal misalignment between force and position signals, leading to significant estimation errors as delays increase. To address this, we propose a robust, delay-compensated stiffness estimation framework by deriving an algebraic estimator based on quasi-static equilibrium that explicitly accounts for temporally aligning the expert's input with the novice's response. A Normalised Weighted Least Squares (NWLS) implementation is then introduced to robustly filter dynamic bias resulting from the algebraic derivation. Experiments using commercial rehabilitation robots (H-MAN) as the platform demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the standard estimator, maintaining consistent tracking accuracy under multiple introduced delays. These findings offer a promising solution for achieving high-fidelity haptic perception in remote dyadic interaction, potentially facilitating reliable stiffness assessment in therapeutic settings across networks."}

Nevertheless, their specific impact on hybrid radar fusion (HRF) remains largely unexplored. In HRF systems, where uplink (UL) paths carry direct and reflected signals in the same frequency band, the reflected signal is often significantly weaker, making HRF performance particularly sensitive to ADC resolution. To study this effect, we use the quantized Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) to measure sensing accuracy. This work derives an upper bound on the quantized CRB for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation and explores CRB-rate trade-offs through two formulated optimization problems. Simulation results indicate that HRF becomes infeasible when the dynamic range of the received signal exceeds the dynamic range supported by the ADC, which is inherently limited by its resolution. Furthermore, the UL communication rate does not increase significantly when the ADC resolution is raised beyond a certain threshold. These observations highlight a fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication performance: while HRF performance benefits from higher ADC resolutions, the corresponding gains in communication rate plateau. This trade-off is effectively characterized using CRB-rate boundaries derived through simulation."}

With the integration of customized Mamba architecture, the proposed framework handles large-scale subcarrier channel estimation efficiently while capturing long-distance dependencies among these subcarriers effectively. Unlike conventional Mamba structure, this paper implements a bidirectional selective scan to improve channel estimation performance, because channel gains at different subcarriers are non-causal. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibits relatively lower space complexity than transformer-based neural networks. Simulation results tested on the 3GPP TS 36.101 channel demonstrate that compared to other baseline neural network solutions, the proposed method achieves improved channel estimation performance with a reduced number of tunable parameters."}

Generative world models offer a promising alternative for general-purpose embodied AI, yet a critical gap remains between their pixel-level plans and physically executable actions.\n  To this end, we propose the Tool-Centric Inverse Dynamics Model (TC-IDM). By focusing on the tool's imagined trajectory as synthesized by the world model, TC-IDM establishes a robust intermediate representation that bridges the gap between visual planning and physical control.\n  TC-IDM extracts the tool's point cloud trajectories via segmentation and 3D motion estimation from generated videos. Considering diverse tool attributes, our architecture employs decoupled action heads to project these planned trajectories into 6-DoF end-effector motions and corresponding control signals.\n  This plan-and-translate paradigm not only supports a wide range of end-effectors but also significantly improves viewpoint invariance. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities across long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks, including interacting with deformable objects.\n  In real-world evaluations, the world model with TC-IDM achieves an average success rate of 61.11 percent, with 77.7 percent on simple tasks and 38.46 percent on zero-shot deformable object tasks.

Existing approaches face significant limitations because data-driven methods lack diversity due to their reliance on existing latent distributions, whereas adversarial methods often produce unrealistic scenarios lacking physical fidelity. Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM)-based methods show significant promise. However, they suffer from context suppression issues where internal parametric knowledge overrides crash specifications, producing scenarios that deviate from actual accident characteristics. This paper presents SG-CADVLM (A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation), a framework that integrates Context-Aware Decoding with multi-modal input processing to generate safety-critical scenarios from crash reports and road network diagrams. The framework mitigates VLM hallucination issues while enabling the simultaneous generation of road geometry and vehicle trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate that SG-CADVLM generates critical risk scenarios at a rate of 84.4% compared to 12.5% for the baseline methods, representing an improvement of 469%, while producing executable simulations for autonomous vehicle testing."}

This contribution investigates the integration of technical and professional skills while teaching specialized curricula in computer science. We propose a broadly applicable, step-by-step methodology that connects core technical concepts (e.g., information entropy, network security) with fine arts practices such as music, video production, gaming, and performing arts (e.g., Oxford-style debates). The methodology was applied in several computer science courses at technical universities, where quantitative and qualitative assessments, including student questionnaires and exam scores, showed improved learning outcomes and increased student engagement compared to traditional methods. The results indicate that this art-based integration can effectively bridge the historical divide between the two schools of thought, offering a practical direction for educators. Within this context, we also identify open issues that will guide future research on topics such as instructor engagement, female motivation in technical subjects, and scalability of these approaches."}

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled language-driven navigation with improved interpretability. However, most LLM-based agents still rely on single-shot action decisions, where the model must choose one option from noisy, textualized multi-perspective observations. Due to local mismatches and imperfect intermediate reasoning, such decisions can easily deviate from the correct path, leading to error accumulation and reduced reliability in unseen environments. In this paper, we propose DV-VLN, a new VLN framework that follows a generate-then-verify paradigm. DV-VLN first performs parameter-efficient in-domain adaptation of an open-source LLaMA-2 backbone to produce a structured navigational chain-of-thought, and then verifies candidate actions with two complementary channels: True-False Verification (TFV) and Masked-Entity Verification (MEV). DV-VLN selects actions by aggregating verification successes across multiple samples, yielding interpretable scores for reranking. Experiments on R2R, RxR (English subset), and REVERIE show that DV-VLN consistently improves over direct prediction and sampling-only baselines, achieving competitive performance among language-only VLN agents and promising results compared with several cross-modal systems.Code is available at https://github.com/PlumJun/DV-VLN."}

Their practical performance, however, is often constrained by unmodelled effects, including noise, imperfect state preparation, and non-ideal control fields.\n  In this work, we report the first experimental implementation of a graybox modelling strategy for a solid-state open quantum system. The graybox framework integrates a physics-based system model with a data-driven description of experimental imperfections, achieving higher fidelity than purely analytical (whitebox) approaches while requiring fewer training resources than fully deep-learning models. We experimentally validate the method on the task of estimating a static magnetic field using a single-spin quantum sensor, performing Bayesian inference with a graybox model trained on prior experimental data. Using roughly 10,000 training datapoints, the graybox model yields several orders of magnitude improvement in mean squared error over the corresponding physics-only model. These results are broadly applicable to a wide range of quantum sensing platforms, not limited to single-spin systems, and are particularly valuable for real-time adaptive protocols, where model inaccuracies can otherwise lead to suboptimal control and degraded performance."}

This formulation decomposes long-horizon prediction into global semantic decision-making and local motion modeling, effectively restricting the support of future trajectories to semantically feasible subsets. To efficiently estimate the NKP prior from historical observations, we adopt a pretrain-finetune strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world AIS data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for long travel durations, directional accuracy, and fine-grained trajectory prediction."}

This representation holds strong potential to bypass the nonlinear configuration-to-workspace mapping while preserving accurate whole-body geometry and providing optimization-friendly collision costs. Yet, extending this capability to mobile manipulators is hindered by unbounded workspaces and tighter base-arm coupling. We lift this promise to mobile manipulation with Generalized Configuration Space Distance Fields (GCDF), extending CDF to robots with both translational and rotational joints in unbounded workspaces with tighter base-arm coupling. We prove that GCDF preserves Euclidean-like local distance structure and accurately encodes whole-body geometry in configuration space, and develop a data generation and training pipeline that yields continuous neural GCDFs with accurate values and gradients, supporting efficient GPU-batched queries. Building on this representation, we develop a high-performance sequential convex optimization framework centered on GCDF-based collision reasoning. The solver scales to large numbers of implicit constraints through (i) online specification of neural constraints, (ii) sparsity-aware active-set detection with parallel batched evaluation across thousands of constraints, and (iii) incremental constraint management for rapid replanning under scene changes."}

Each sub-network specializes in a unique pair of dimensions, contributing distinct insights to the final prediction, akin to a collaborative team with diverse expertise.

Our objective is to estimate this slip-induced error and compensate for it. To this end, we augment an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (InEKF) with a neural compensator that uses an attention mechanism to infer error conditioned on foot-slip severity and then applies this estimate as a post-update compensation to the InEKF state (i.e., after the filter update). The compensator is trained in a latent space, which aims to reduce sensitivity to raw input scales and encourages structured slip-conditioned compensations, while preserving the InEKF recursion. Experiments demonstrate improved performance compared to existing legged-robot state estimators, particularly under slip-prone conditions."}

As such, it is imperative that decoding models are able to generalize across variations, such as recordings from different brain sites, distinct sessions, different types of behavior, and a variety of subjects. Current models can only partially address these challenges and warrant the development of pretrained neural transformer models capable to adapt and generalize. In this work, we propose RPNT - Robust Pretrained Neural Transformer, designed to achieve robust generalization through pretraining, which in turn enables effective finetuning given a downstream task. In particular, RPNT unique components include 1) Multidimensional rotary positional embedding (MRoPE) to aggregate experimental metadata such as site coordinates, session name and behavior types; 2) Context-based attention mechanism via convolution kernels operating on global attention to learn local temporal structures for handling non-stationarity of neural population activity; 3) Robust self-supervised learning (SSL) objective with uniform causal masking strategies and contrastive representations. We pretrained two separate versions of RPNT on distinct datasets a) Multi-session, multi-task, and multi-subject microelectrode benchmark; b) Multi-site recordings using high-density Neuropixel 1.0 probes. The datasets include recordings from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and from the primary motor cortex (M1) regions of nonhuman primates (NHPs) as they performed reaching tasks. After pretraining, we evaluated the generalization of RPNT in cross-session, cross-type, cross-subject, and cross-site downstream behavior decoding tasks. Our results show that RPNT consistently achieves and surpasses the decoding performance of existing decoding models in all tasks."}

Crucially, the framework possesses robust source discrimination capabilities, distinguishing between policy-generated and teleoperated videos with 99.6% accuracy, thereby establishing a rigorous standard for trustworthy robotic evaluation.

This paper proposes a cost-effective heterogeneous massive MIMO architecture that integrates centralized co-located antennas at a cell-center base station with distributed edge APs. By strategically splitting massive antennas between centralized and distributed nodes, the system maintains high user fairness comparable to CF systems but reduces infrastructure costs substantially, by minimizing the required number of AP sites and fronthaul connections. Numerical results demonstrate its superiority in balancing performance and costs compared to cellular and CF systems."}

As the field transitions toward more complex task scenarios, multi-agent system frameworks are becoming essential for achieving scalable, efficient, and collaborative solutions.

To address the challenges posed by multi-agent collaboration, we propose the Multi-Agent Robotic System (MARS) Challenge, held at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on SpaVLE. The competition focuses on two critical areas: planning and control, where participants explore multi-agent embodied planning using vision-language models (VLMs) to coordinate tasks and policy execution to perform robotic manipulation in dynamic environments. By evaluating solutions submitted by participants, the challenge provides valuable insights into the design and coordination of embodied multi-agent systems, contributing to the future development of advanced collaborative AI systems."}

Moreover, regularization terms defined to preserve the variance of both source and target tensors, ensures robust performance. Our framework is versatile, effectively generalizing existing tensor-based DA methods as special cases. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances DA conversion speed but also significantly boosts classification accuracy. This positions our method as superior to current state-of-the-art techniques, making it a preferable choice for complex domain adaptation tasks."}

However, existing FDR frameworks exhibit various limitations, such as significant delays in communication and computation, and unreliability in robot motion/trajectory generation, mainly because the communication-computation-control (3C) loop is designed without considering the downstream FDR goal. To address this, we propose a novel Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) framework that jointly designs the 3C loop tailored for fast and robust robotic FDR, with the goal of minimising the FDR time while maximising the robotic task (e.g., workpiece sorting) success rate. For fault detection, our GoC framework innovatively defines and extracts the 3D scene graph (3D-SG) as the semantic representation via our designed representation extractor, and detects faults by monitoring spatial relationship changes in the 3D-SG. For fault recovery, we fine-tune a small language model (SLM) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and enhance its reasoning and generalization capabilities via knowledge distillation to generate recovery motions for robots. We also design a lightweight goal-oriented digital twin reconstruction module to refine the recovery motions generated by the SLM when fine-grained robotic control is required, using only task-relevant object contours for digital twin reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our GoC framework reduces the FDR time by up to 82.6% and improves the task success rate by up to 76%, compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks that rely on vision language models for fault detection and large language models for fault recovery."}

In this work, we introduce a new class of estimators called $p$-MAP estimators, which enable us to model the MAP estimator as a piecewise constant function with finitely many stages, bringing us closer to a full characterization of the MAP estimators when modeling information freshness."}

Many amateur and professional photographers like to use drones for aerial photography. Drones play a non-negligible role in agriculture and transportation too. Drones can be used to spray pesticides, and they can also transport supplies. A quadcopter is a four-rotor drone and has been studied in this paper. In this paper, random noise is added to the quadcopter system and its effects on the drone system are studied. An extended Kalman filter has been used to estimate the state based on noisy observations from the sensor. Based on a SDE system, a linear quadratic Gaussian controller has been implemented. The expectation maximization algorithm has been applied for parameter estimation of the quadcopter. The results of offline parameter estimation and online parameter estimation are presented. The results show that the online parameter estimation has a slightly larger range of convergence values than the offline parameter estimation."}

Unlike conventional video (RGB with stereo/mono audio), our video stream provides a spatially grounded visualization of sound intensity across a scene, offering a new and powerful dimension of perceptual understanding. Our real-time pipeline uses low-cost beamforming microphone arrays that are already common in smart speakers and increasingly present in robotics and XR headsets, yet this sensing capability remains unutilized for scene understanding. To assess the value of spatial acoustic information, we constructed an evaluation set of 402 question-answer scenes, comparing a state-of-the-art VLM given conventional video with and without paired acoustic field video. Results show a clear and consistent improvement when incorporating spatial acoustic data; the VLM we test improves from 38.3% correct to 67.4%. Our findings highlight that many everyday scene understanding tasks remain underconstrained when relying solely on visual and audio input, and that acoustic field data provides a promising and practical direction for multimodal reasoning.

Unlike language-conditioned approaches that require semantic input at deployment, ConceptACT uses human-provided concepts (object properties, spatial relationships, task constraints) exclusively during demonstration collection, adding minimal annotation burden. We integrate concepts using a modified transformer architecture in which the final encoder layer implements concept-aware cross-attention, supervised to align with human annotations. Through experiments on two robotic manipulation tasks with logical constraints, we demonstrate that ConceptACT converges faster and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard ACT. Crucially, we show that architectural integration through attention mechanisms significantly outperforms naive auxiliary prediction losses or language-conditioned models. These results demonstrate that properly integrated semantic supervision provides powerful inductive biases for more efficient robot learning."}

The module is an autonomous system capable of traveling to designated regions, excavating soil, collecting samples, and performing biochemical testing onboard the rover itself. The project is inherently multidisciplinary, integrating mechanical systems such as a drill mechanism and a vacuum system, alongside biochemical analysis for soil testing. The module is capable of successfully detecting the presence or absence of living components of life from the collected soil particles.

Our method, MC+QUBO, integrates a combinatorial filtering step into standard MC policy evaluation: from each batch of trajectories, we select a subset that maximizes cumulative reward while promoting state-space coverage. This selection is encoded as a QUBO, where linear terms favor high-reward episodes and quadratic terms penalize redundancy. We explore both Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) and Simulated Bifurcation (SB) as black-box solvers within this framework. Experiments in a finite-horizon GridWorld demonstrate that MC+QUBO outperforms vanilla MC in convergence speed and final policy quality, highlighting the potential of quantum-inspired optimization as a decision-making subroutine in reinforcement learning."}

Existing vision-language-action models often fail to generalize because (i) multi-view features are fused via view-agnostic token concatenation, yielding weak 3D-consistent spatial understanding, and (ii) language is injected as global conditioning, resulting in coarse instruction grounding.\n  In this paper, we introduce PEAfowl, a perception-enhanced multi-view VLA policy for bimanual manipulation. For spatial reasoning, PEAfowl predicts per-token depth distributions, performs differentiable 3D lifting, and aggregates local cross-view neighbors to form geometrically grounded, cross-view consistent representations. For instruction grounding, we propose to replace global conditioning with a Perceiver-style text-aware readout over frozen CLIP visual features, enabling iterative evidence accumulation. To overcome noisy and incomplete commodity depth without adding inference overhead, we apply training-only depth distillation from a pretrained depth teacher to supervise the depth-distribution head, providing perception front-end with geometry-aware priors.\n  On RoboTwin 2.0 under domain-randomized setting, PEAfowl improves the strongest baseline by 23.0 pp in success rate, and real-robot experiments further demonstrate reliable sim-to-real transfer and consistent improvements from depth distillation.\n  Project website: https://peafowlvla.github.io/."}

In this work, we argue that the inaccuracies from depth sensors can be viewed as \"masked\" signals that inherently reflect underlying geometric ambiguities. Building on this motivation, we present LingBot-Depth, a depth completion model which leverages visual context to refine depth maps through masked depth modeling and incorporates an automated data curation pipeline for scalable training. It is encouraging to see that our model outperforms top-tier RGB-D cameras in terms of both depth precision and pixel coverage.

A primary obstacle in ORL remains the distributional shift between the static dataset and the learned policy, which typically mandates high degrees of conservatism that can restrain potential policy improvements. We present MoReBRAC, a model-based framework that addresses this limitation through Uncertainty-Aware latent synthesis. Instead of relying solely on the fixed data, MoReBRAC utilizes a dual-recurrent world model to synthesize high-fidelity transitions that augment the training manifold. To ensure the reliability of this synthetic data, we implement a hierarchical uncertainty pipeline integrating Variational Autoencoder (VAE) manifold detection, model sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. This multi-layered filtering process guarantees that only transitions residing within high-confidence regions of the learned dynamics are utilized. Our results on D4RL Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks reveal significant performance gains, particularly in ``random'' and ``suboptimal'' data regimes. We further provide insights into the role of the VAE as a geometric anchor and discuss the distributional trade-offs encountered when learning from near-optimal datasets."}
