This\nwork investigates the co-design of integrated sensing, communication, and\ncontrol ($\\mathbf{SC^{2}}$) for multi-UAV cooperative systems with finite\nblocklength (FBL) transmission. In particular, the UAVs continuously monitor\nthe state of the field robots and transmit their observations to the robot\ncontroller to ensure stable control while cooperating to localize an unknown\nsensing target (ST). To this end, a weighted optimization problem is first\nformulated by jointly considering the control and localization performance in\nterms of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost and the determinant of the\nFisher information matrix (FIM), respectively. The resultant problem,\noptimizing resource allocations, the UAVs' deployment positions, and multi-user\nscheduling, is non-convex. To circumvent this challenge, we first derive a\nclosed-form expression of the LQR cost with respect to other variables.\nSubsequently, the non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into a series\nof sub-problems by leveraging the alternating optimization (AO) approach, in\nwhich the difference of convex functions (DC) programming and projected\ngradient descent (PGD) method are employed to obtain an efficient near-optimal\nsolution. Furthermore, the convergence and computational complexity of the\nproposed algorithm are thoroughly analyzed. Extensive simulation results are\npresented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to\nthe benchmark schemes and reveal the trade-off between control and sensing\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u670d\u52a1\u548c6G\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u548cDC\u7f16\u7a0b\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f20\u611f\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The objective\nis to maximize the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across all locations\nwithin these areas through joint optimization of MA positions, IRS reflection\ncoefficients, and transmit beamforming.

However, it cannot directly\nmeasure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection\nfraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic\nresonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed\nstructural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL\nachieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving\npatients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac\nfunction parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.

This research\ninvestigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal\nprocessing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem\nin low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)\nMel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with\na Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered\nsubset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based\non speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN\narchitecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and\nstrong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the\nWavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These\nfindings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with\nconvolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working\nwith limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to\ndataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,\nproviding a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further\nimprovement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of\nself-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural\narchitectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong\nbaseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within\nresource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
