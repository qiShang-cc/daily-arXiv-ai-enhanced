### [1] [Real-Time Markov Modeling for Single-Photon LiDAR: $1000 \times$ Acceleration and Convergence Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20500)
*Weijian Zhang,Hashan K. Weerasooriya,Prateek Chennuri,Stanley H. Chan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的非顺序马尔可夫建模方法，用于解决异步单光子LiDAR在死区时间影响下的时间戳分布建模问题，并通过等效公式化和矩阵重构实现了高达1000倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步单光子LiDAR在3D成像和导航中具有重要作用，但死区时间的存在使得时间戳分布建模成为一个挑战性问题。

Method: 通过等效公式化重新参数化积分边界，并将死区时间的影响分离为基矩阵的行置换，从而实现高效的矩阵构造。

Result: 新模型实现了高达1000倍的加速，并且与蒙特卡洛模拟结果几乎完全一致。理论分析还揭示了第二大特征值的幅度和相位对收敛性的关键影响。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅显著提升了计算效率，还为时间戳分布建模提供了更准确的理论基础。

Abstract: Asynchronous single-photon LiDAR (SP-LiDAR) is an important imaging modality
for high-quality 3D applications and navigation, but the modeling of the
timestamp distributions of a SP-LiDAR in the presence of dead time remains a
very challenging open problem. Prior works have shown that timestamps form a
discrete-time Markov chain, whose stationary distribution can be computed as
the leading left eigenvector of a large transition matrix. However,
constructing this matrix is known to be computationally expensive because of
the coupling between states and the dead time. This paper presents the first
non-sequential Markov modeling for the timestamp distribution. The key
innovation is an equivalent formulation that reparameterizes the integral
bounds and separates the effect of dead time as a deterministic row permutation
of a base matrix. This decoupling enables efficient vectorized matrix
construction, yielding up to $1000 \times$ acceleration over existing methods.
The new model produces a nearly exact stationary distribution when compared
with the gold standard Monte Carlo simulations, yet using a fraction of the
time. In addition, a new theoretical analysis reveals the impact of the
magnitude and phase of the second-largest eigenvalue, which are overlooked in
the literature but are critical to the convergence.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了离散PA辅助的无线供电MEC系统，优化能量收集和任务卸载效率，比较了TDMA和NOMA方案性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统连续PA假设的局限性，探索离散PA在提升能量传输和任务卸载效率中的实际应用价值。

Method: 提出双层算法，结合KKT条件和交叉熵学习方法，解决混合整数非线性优化问题。

Result: 数值结果表明，TDMA和NOMA在粗粒度PA激活下表现相当，而细粒度激活时TDMA更优。

Conclusion: 离散PA设计在实际应用中具有优越性，TDMA在更精细激活粒度下表现更好。

Abstract: Pinching antennas (PAs), a new type of reconfigurable and flexible antenna
structures, have recently attracted significant research interest due to their
ability to create line-of-sight links and mitigate large-scale path loss. Owing
to their potential benefits, integrating PAs into wireless powered mobile edge
computing (MEC) systems is regarded as a viable solution to enhance both energy
transfer and task offloading efficiency. Unlike prior studies that assume ideal
continuous PA placement along waveguides, this paper investigates a practical
discrete PA-assisted wireless powered MEC framework, where devices first
harvest energy from PA-emitted radio-frequency signals and then adopt a partial
offloading mode, allocating part of the harvested energy to local computing and
the remainder to uplink offloading. The uplink phase considers both the
time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),
each examined under three levels of PA activation flexibility. For each
configuration, we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the total
computational bits and conduct a theoretical performance comparison between the
TDMA and NOMA schemes. To address the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear
problems, we develop a two-layer algorithm that combines closed-form solutions
based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with a cross-entropy-based
learning method. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed
design in terms of the harvested energy and computation performance, revealing
that TDMA and NOMA achieve comparable performance under coarser PA activation
levels, whereas finer activation granularity enables TDMA to achieve superior
computation performance over NOMA.

### [3] [A General Optimization Framework for Movable Antenna Systems via Discrete Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20987)
*Changhao Liu,Weidong Mei,Zhi Chen,Jun Fang,Boyu Ning*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种低复杂度的优化框架，通过离散化天线移动区域并引入Gibbs采样来优化天线位置，显著提升了通信性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MA系统在无线通信中具有潜力，但现有方法因计算复杂或陷入局部最优而难以优化天线位置。

Method: 将天线移动区域离散化为采样点，转换为离散选择问题，并引入Gibbs采样以探索更优解。

Result: 数值结果表明，该算法接近最优性能，且明显优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: 该优化框架有效解决了MA系统的天线位置优化问题，具有低复杂度和高性能的特点。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) systems have attracted growing interest in wireless
communications due to their ability to reshape wireless channels via local
antenna movement within a confined region. However, optimizing antenna
positions to enhance communication performance turns out to be challenging due
to the highly nonlinear relationship between wireless channels and antenna
positions. Existing approaches, such as gradient-based and heuristic
algorithms, often suffer from high computational complexity or undesired local
optima. To address the above challenge, this letter proposes a general and
low-complexity optimization framework for MA position optimization.
Specifically, we discretize the antenna movement region into a set of sampling
points, thereby transforming the continuous optimization problem into a
discrete point selection problem. Next, we sequentially update the optimal
sampling point for each MA over multiple rounds. To avoid convergence to poor
local optima, a Gibbs sampling (GS) phase is introduced between rounds to
explore adjacent and randomly generated candidate solutions. As a case study,
we investigate joint precoding and antenna position optimization for an
MA-enhanced broadcast system by applying the proposed framework. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal
performance and significantly outperforms existing benchmarks.

### [4] [Shapley Features for Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21032)
*Mohammad Ali Vahedifar,Qi Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合高斯过程（GP）和ResNet神经网络的新预测框架，并通过Shapley特征值（SFV）优化特征选择，显著提高了触觉互联网（TI）中的信号恢复精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉互联网需要超低延迟和可靠的触觉信号传输，但数据包丢失和延迟问题仍未解决。

Method: 结合高斯过程和ResNet神经网络，利用SFV进行特征选择，以优化预测性能。

Result: 该框架实现了95.72%的准确率，比现有方法LeFo高出11.1%，同时显著降低了延迟和推理时间。

Conclusion: GP+SFV框架为触觉互联网提供了一种高精度、高效率的解决方案，推动了其实际应用。

Abstract: The Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and reliable haptic
signal transmission, yet packet loss and delay remain unresolved challenges. We
present a novel prediction framework that integrates Gaussian Processes (GP)
with a ResNet-based Neural Network, where GP acts as an oracle to recover
signals lost or heavily delayed. To further optimize performance, we introduce
Shapley Feature Values (SFV), a principled feature selection mechanism that
isolates the most informative inputs for prediction. This GP+SFV framework
achieves 95.72% accuracy, surpassing the state-of-the-art LeFo method by 11.1%,
while simultaneously relaxing TI's rigid delay constraints. Beyond accuracy,
SFV operates as a modular accelerator: when paired with LeFo, it reduces
inference time by 27%, and when paired with GP, by 72%. These results establish
GP+SFV as both a high-accuracy and high-efficiency solution, paving the way for
practical and reliable haptic communications in TI systems.

*Ziyi Wang,Frederik Zumegen,Christoph Studer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于MIMO-OFDM下行链路的神经ISAC信号处理框架，通过数据驱动学习技术在不修改通信链路的情况下实现通用感知功能，生成空间占用的离散地图表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该神经ISAC框架成功实现了感知与通信的集成，为下一代网络提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The ongoing convergence of spectrum and hardware requirements for wireless
sensing and communication applications has fueled the integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) paradigm in next-generation networks. Neural-network-based
ISAC leverages data-driven learning techniques to add sensing capabilities to
existing communication infrastructure. This paper presents a novel
signal-processing framework for such neural ISAC systems based on the
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) downlink. Our approach enables generalized sensing
functionality without modifying the MIMO-OFDM communication link. Specifically,
our neural ISAC pipeline measures the backscattered communication signals to
generate discrete map representations of spatial occupancy, formulated as
multiclass or multilabel classification problems, which can then be utilized by
specialized downstream tasks. To improve sensing performance in closed or
cluttered environments, our neural ISAC pipeline relies on features
specifically designed to mitigate strong reflective paths. Extensive
simulations using ray-tracing models demonstrate that our neural ISAC framework
reliably reconstructs scene maps without altering the MIMO-OFDM communication
pipeline or reducing data rates.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统框架，通过随机频率和脉冲重复间隔灵活性（RFPA）方法设计波形，结合共享密钥增强安全性，并提出混合信息嵌入方案提高数据吞吐量。

Result: 波形具有优异的距离-速度分辨率和杂波抑制能力，通过模糊函数（AF）验证其性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了ISAC系统的安全性、数据速率和感知能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing the security, data rate,
and sensing performance of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)
systems. We employ a random frequency and pulse repetition interval (PRI)
agility (RFPA) method for the waveform design, where the necessary random
sequences are governed by shared secrets. These secrets, which can be
pre-shared or generated via channel reciprocity, obfuscate critical radar
parameters like Doppler frequency and pulse start times, thereby significantly
impeding the ability to perform reconnaissance from a passive adversary without
the secret key. To further introduce enhanced data throughput, we also
introduce a hybrid information embedding scheme that integrates amplitude shift
keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), index modulation (IM), and spatial
modulation (SM), for which a low-complexity sparse-matched filter receiver is
proposed for accurate decoding with practical complexity. Finally, the
excellent range-velocity resolution and clutter suppression of the proposed
waveform are analyzed via the ambiguity function (AF).

Conclusion: AR-PLA框架为非平稳MIMO信道提供了高效的物理层认证方案，显著提升了对抗欺骗的能力。

Abstract: We propose an adversarially robust physical layer authentication (AR-PLA)
framework tailored for non-stationary multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
wireless channels. The framework integrates sequential Bayesian
decision-making, deep feature extraction via contrastive learning, and
generative adversarial modeling to simulate adaptive spoofers. Unlike
conventional methods that assume stationary channels or independent
observations, our approach explicitly accounts for temporal and spatial
correlations, line-of-sight (LoS) blockages, and dynamic spoofing strategies. A
comprehensive analytical characterization of the authentication performance
using both 2-state and 3-state hidden Markov models (HMMs) with moving-average
online adaptation is also provided, with closed-form recursions for
loglikelihood ratios, detection probabilities, and steady-state approximations,
which demonstrate significant robustness improvement over classical sequential
authentication schemes.

Abstract: Bearings are among the most failure-prone components in rotating machinery,
and their condition directly impacts overall performance. Therefore, accurately
diagnosing bearing faults is essential for ensuring system stability. However,
detecting such malfunctions in noisy environments, where data is collected from
multiple sensors, necessitates the extraction and selection of informative
features. This paper proposes an improved distance evaluation algorithm
combined with a weighted K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for bearing fault
diagnosis. The process begins with extracting and integrating statistical
features of vibration across the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains.
Next, the improved distance evaluation algorithm assigns weights to the
extracted features, retaining only the most informative ones by eliminating
insensitive features. Finally, the selected features are used to train the
weighted KNN classifier. To validate the proposed method, we employ bearing
data from the University of Ottawa. The results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in accurately identifying bearing faults.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着水下监测和矿物勘探等海洋应用的快速发展，实时无线数据传输需求激增，但传统窄带声学方法难以满足，因此探索光无线通信（OWC）成为解决方案。然而，水-空气界面的动态波动导致信号折射方向变化，亟需实时对准技术。

Abstract: The escalating development of oceanic applications like underwater
surveillance and mineral exploration, is motivating real-time wireless backhaul
of the considerable observation data. Such prospects can be hardly realized by
the narrowband acoustic approach. Alternatively, optical wireless communication
(OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for maritime and underwater
applications due to its great potential for broadband underwater transmission.
However, the implementations of water-air OWC can be rather challenging,
especially when penetrating the fluctuating interface, where the direction of
refracted signals changes dynamically, causing severe beam misalignment with
airborne stations. This has necessitated real-time transceiver alignment
adaptable to the sophisticated oceanic environment, which has yet to be
addressed. Against this background, this paper establishes a mathematical
channel model for water-air optical wireless transmission across the
fluctuating sea surface. Based on the model, we propose a vision-based beam
tracking algorithm that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) methods for
dynamic channel prediction. The proposed algorithm integrates a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM),
which further incorporates the attention mechanism to effectively extract
critical spatio-temporal features from the vision data. The numerical
simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform its
classical counterparts in maintaining receiving signal strength and supressing
the vision noises, which demonstrates its robustness against the the harsh
conditions of water-air OWC systems.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of sensor output uncertainty is important for
reliable data interpretation in many applications. Here, we investigate the
impact of transducer-level measurement uncertainty on overall sensor
measurement accuracy due to limited-precision information about sensor
components. We explain our method using thermopile-based sensors as an example
class of sensors. We show how sensor calibration and conversion equations,
which are an essential part of all sensing systems, propagate uncertainties
resulting from the quantization of calibration parameters, to the final,
compensated sensor output. The experimental results show that the epistemic
uncertainty of calibration-related quantities leads to absolute error in the
sensor output as high as 5.3 {\deg}C (and relative error as high as 25.7%) for
one commonly-used thermopile sensor. In one instance of using the epistemic
uncertainty information in edge detection, we show reduction of false-positives
edges to zero for the conventional Canny operator, while maintaining accuracy.
We show these ideas are practical and possible on actual embedded sensor
systems by prototyping them on two commercially-available uncertainty tracking
hardware platforms, one with average power dissipation 16.7 mW and 42.9x
speedup compared to the equal-confidence Monte Carlo computation (the status
quo), and the other with average power dissipation 147.15 mW and 94.4x speedup,
paving the way for use in real time.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

not considered previously including a noticeable increase in adopting Formal
Synthesis approaches as well as Probabilistic Verification Techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型和机器人技术的快速发展，VLN成为具有广泛应用前景的关键任务。在连续环境中，VLN尤为复杂，智能体需同时处理自然语言指令、感知环境和规划低层动作。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合路径点预测和MLLM推理，显著提升了零样本VLN的性能。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The elephant trunk exemplifies a natural gripper where structure, actuation,
and sensing are seamlessly integrated. Inspired by the distal morphology of the
African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous
structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

TL;DR: 摘要介绍了四足机器人在密集复杂环境中通过单腿推物体清理路径的方法，重点是解决推物体时物体被遮挡的难题，提出了一种结合感知与行动的框架，提高了任务成功率和跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集复杂环境中自主操作的机器人需要安全地与障碍物交互以清理路径，但单腿推物体时可能因遮挡导致跟踪困难，因此需要一种新的方法来处理这种约束。

Method: 提出了一种紧密耦合的感知-行动框架，利用本体感觉反馈（如足部接触和腿位置）预测物体在被遮挡时的位移，从而在交互后重新检测物体。

Result: 在Boston Dynamics Spot机器人上的实验表明，该方法比开环基准方法在推动物体上楼梯时有更高的任务成功率和跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 这种交互感知的状态估计方法有效解决了单腿推物体时的遮挡问题，提升了机器人在复杂环境中的操作能力。

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

*Anujith Muraleedharan,Anamika J H*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARQ是一种进展感知的查询策略，只在学习停滞或退步时请求人类反馈，显著减少了不必要的反馈需求，并在模拟任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中人类的反馈成本高且有限，现有方法假设反馈充足，实用性受限。

Method: 提出了SPARQ策略，通过仅在需要时请求反馈，减少冗余请求。在PyBullet中模拟UR5立方体抓取任务进行验证。

Result: SPARQ在任务成功率上与始终请求反馈的方法相当，但仅使用约一半的反馈预算，且学习更稳定高效。

Conclusion: 选择性、基于进展的查询策略使HiL-RL在现实条件下的机器人应用中更高效和可扩展。

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at

Conclusion: 该框架为实现完全自主的海洋环境监测提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot
Operating System (ROS), processing real-time sensor data to update
probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous
environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid response to marine
pollution incidents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了Latent Activation Editing (LAE)框架，通过在线分类器和激活编辑模块，在不修改预训练策略权重或架构的情况下，提升多旋翼无人机导航的安全性，减少碰撞次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在多旋翼无人机协调和导航等领域取得进展，但训练后的策略在复杂环境中仍可能发生碰撞。传统方法通过重新训练或微调解决这一问题成本高且可能影响已有技能。受大语言模型激活引导和计算机视觉潜在编辑的启发，作者希望开发一种轻量级方法，在推理时直接优化策略行为。

Method: LAE框架分为两部分：(1)在线分类器检测与不安全行为相关的状态，(2)激活编辑模块选择性修改标记的激活状态，引导策略进入更安全的模式。具体实现中，作者通过潜在碰撞世界模型预测未来碰撞前的激活状态，促使策略提前采取避障措施。

Result: 大量仿真和实际Crazyflie实验显示，LAE显著减少了碰撞次数（比基线减少近90%），同时保持了任务完成率，且该方法适用于资源受限的硬件。

Conclusion: LAE为学习型机器人策略提供了一种轻量级的后部署优化方法，能够在不需要修改模型权重的情况下显著提高安全性，且具备实际硬件可行性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

Motivation: 现有的BCI-机器人系统存在EEG信号噪声大、目标选择不灵活、缺乏闭环验证等问题，限制了在辅助场景中的实际应用。论文旨在通过整合新技术解决这些问题。

Method: 采用14通道EEG耳机进行运动想象校准，智能手机AR界面提供多目标导航和方向一致的反馈，机器人结合视觉姿态估计实现自主抓取。

Result: 运动想象训练准确率达93.1%，AR神经反馈显著提高控制稳定性（SCI = 0.210），闭环抓取成功率达97.2%，显示了系统的优越性能。

Conclusion: AR反馈显著稳定了基于EEG的控制，提出的框架实现了高效的零接触抓取，为辅助机器人应用和人机交互提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing
assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in

Conclusion: FINS是一种高效且高精度的解决方案，适用于单图像隐式表示任务。

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法填补了NAS在机器人硬件资源感知方面的空白，并在下游任务中验证了其可扩展性。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

Method: 提出RuN框架，结合预训练的条件运动生成器（提供自然运动先验）和强化学习策略（学习轻量残差校正）。

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上实验表明，RuN支持0-2.5米/秒速度范围内的稳定自然步态与平滑过渡，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RuN通过任务分解有效提升了人形机器人的运动控制能力，为复杂动态运动提供了新思路。

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

Motivation: 提升建筑行业数字化管理水平，通过动态数字孪生连接设计与实时工地数据，优化施工安全与效率。

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的框架，通过Beta-Bernoulli贝叶斯融合将自然语言指令与BIM语义地图结合，提升机器人路径规划的稳健性和上下文感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，将自然语言提示融入机器人任务规划引起了广泛关注，尤其是在建筑领域，BIM模型提供了丰富的环境描述信息。

Method: 该方法通过将LLM视为传感器，利用Beta-Bernoulli贝叶斯融合处理障碍物排斥系数和LLM返回的危险评分，生成上下文感知的排斥增益，并以此增强基于欧几里得距离的势场启发式。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在路径稳健性和有效性方面取得了定量和定性的提升。

Conclusion: 提供了一种数值稳定的方法，能够集成多来源的自然语言指令，增强机器人在复杂环境中的规划能力。

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RobotDancing框架，用于解决人形机器人长期高动态运动跟踪中的误差累积问题，通过预测残余关节目标校正动态差异，并在零样本条件下实现仿真到现实的部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人在长期高动态运动跟踪中因模型与实际差异导致的误差积累问题。

Method: 采用端到端管道，利用单阶段强化学习设置，预测残余关节目标以显式校正动力学差异，并在仿真中训练、验证后零样本部署到现实硬件。

Result: 在Unitree G1和H1/H1-2上验证了多分钟高能行为（如跳跃、旋转、侧手翻）的跟踪能力，并实现了高质量的零样本现实部署。

Conclusion: RobotDancing框架有效解决了误差累积问题，为复杂行为的动态跟踪提供了可扩展且简单的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM在足式机器人导航中因快速运动、校准需求和传感器漂移等问题表现脆弱，且缺乏任务驱动的语义推理能力。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出视觉-语言导航框架，包括分层视觉-语言感知模块和语义-概率拓扑地图，结合LLM的全局推理和视觉的局部规划，并与强化学习运动控制器集成。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在语义准确性、规划质量和导航成功率上均有显著提升，消融实验验证了分层感知和局部规划的必要性。

Conclusion: 该研究为SLAM-free导航提供新范式，从几何为中心转向语义驱动的决策。

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

Motivation: 传统视觉SLAM在低纹理环境和挑战性视觉条件下表现不佳，而现有方法丢弃了多传感器信息融合的优势。

Method: 通过Sim(3)视觉对齐约束和层次因子图设计，结合惯性测量和GNSS数据，实现实时位姿跟踪和全局一致地图。

Result: 在公开数据集和自采数据上，MASt3R-Fusion显著优于现有视觉中心的多传感器SLAM系统。

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion展示了多传感器信息融合的有效性，未来将开源代码以支持研究。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Motivation: 多任务强化学习（MTRL）可以提高样本效率和泛化能力，但在机器人学中由于数据收集成本高，应用受限。

Method: 提出了MT-Lévy策略，结合行为共享和Lévy飞行启发的探索，动态调整探索水平。

Result: 实验结果表明，MT-Lévy显著提高了探索效率和样本效率。

Conclusion: 通过行为共享和自适应探索策略的结合，MT-Lévy为MTRL在机器人学中的实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple
tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to
robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task
data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that
enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing
across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight.
MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration
towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on
task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage,
even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that
MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported
by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight
the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing
with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality
of MTRL in robotics applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单一物体或几何占用图，缺乏对房间级语义结构的建模能力。

Method: 提出SemSight模型，采用编码器-解码器网络架构，并引入掩码约束监督策略，专注于未知区域的预测。

Result: 实验表明SemSight在未知区域的关键功能类别预测性能上显著提升，且在SC和PA等指标上优于非掩码监督方法。

Conclusion: SemSight不仅能提升语义预测能力，还能在闭环仿真中提高导航效率，减少搜索步骤。

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

Conclusion: CoMOK方法在模拟和硬件实验中表现出色，为端到端机器人操作策略的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: MTRDrive为自动驾驶系统提供了更安全和可靠的解决方案，展示了显著的进步潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen
scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight
MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more
reliable systems.

Motivation: 可微物理在下游应用中的重要性日益增加，但梯度信息的不稳定性阻碍了优化器的收敛，因此需要改进接触模型设计。

Method: 研究分析了接触模型对梯度行为的影响，并提出了一套确保梯度信息稳定的接触模型属性，同时设计了一种高效的新模型。

Result: 实验表明，新接触模型能够从简单初始化中发现复杂的控制信号，成功完成多种运动和操作任务。

Conclusion: 改进的接触模型解决了梯度信息不稳定的问题，为下游应用提供了更好的性能。

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 自回归模型在自动驾驶规划中表现出色，但其性能受限于时空不对齐问题，即规划器需要基于过去的感知数据预测未来动作，导致世界观不一致。

Method: 提出了TISA模块，将初始环境特征投影到每个未来时间步骤的自我中心框架中；采用运动学动作预测头确保物理可行的轨迹；引入多目标后训练阶段（DPO）细化学习信号。

Result: 在NAVSIM数据集上，模型在自回归模型中达到89.8 PDMS的最高性能。

Conclusion: TISA模块和DPO后训练显著提升了自回归模型的规划性能，解决了时空不对齐问题并提供了更精细的行为反馈。

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

Abstract: We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor

user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task
graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic
mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then
selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For
interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick
and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual
context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs
fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception
and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining
real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static
scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$
overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By
combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system
inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task
generalization of language-conditioned manipulation.

Conclusion: 该方法在多机器人电池拆解中显著提升了自主性、精度和安全性。

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision
Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with
reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path
length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes
shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2:
$0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$
($0.064\rightarrow0.034\,\mathrm{m}^3$). These results highlight improved
autonomy, precision, and safety for multi-robot EV battery disassembly in

Motivation: 当前帧到帧生成方法存在高计算冗余且忽视关键语义过渡，限制了机器人世界模型的实际应用。

Method: 提出KeyWorld框架：识别关键帧并由DiT模型生成，轻量级卷积模型填充中间帧。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，KeyWorld实现5.68倍加速，并提升生成视频的物理合理性。

Conclusion: KeyWorld为实时机器人控制等需要高效有效世界模型的领域提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a
partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to
fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting
stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and
Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive
capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The
proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar
stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with
fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves
superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort,
outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances
fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the
feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient
inference process. Through comprehensive experiments across four distinct
simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this
domain.

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing
modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.

Motivation: 解决传统机器人行为教学中物理演示数据难以规模化收集的问题，探索通过跨模态指令（如文本标签）进行行为塑造的替代方案。

Method: 引入CrossInstruct框架，利用大型视觉语言模型（VLM）整合跨模态指令，生成2D动作视图并融合为3D轨迹；结合小模型精细指向和强化学习完成下游任务。

Conclusion: 跨模态指令与大规模VLM结合有效解决了传统演示的局限性，为机器人行为学习提供了高效且可扩展的新途径。

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: RL的优势源于其对丰富状态观测数据的有效利用，强调了综合状态表征在学习系统中的重要性，并表明增强感知能力可能提升控制器性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将双机械臂抓取分解为两个独立的抓取提案，依赖区域先验或启发式方法，限制了泛化能力且无法保证稳定性。

Method: 提出DAGDiff框架，通过扩散过程在SE(3) x SE(3)空间中直接生成抓取对，并利用分类器信号（几何、稳定性和碰撞感知）指导生成过程。

Result: 通过力闭合检查、碰撞分析和大规模物理仿真验证，DAGDiff在稳定性、碰撞避免和泛化能力上均优于先前方法，并在实际点云中成功生成抓取对。

Conclusion: DAGDiff提供了一种无需显式区域检测或对象先验的双机械臂抓取方案，为复杂物体的可靠抓取提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

Conclusion: ReasonNav通过结合视觉语言模型的推理能力和人类导航行为，显著提升了机器人在大型环境中的导航效率。

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived
detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a
methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed:
a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power
Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers
effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare
and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering
their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to
evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system,
highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis
in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design
omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical
insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research
aligns with the project SAC-1, one of the objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,
fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic

Result: 在7-DOF机械臂上，复杂操作任务的成功率提升17.1%。

Conclusion: 重用注册令牌是一种有效的轻量化方法，同时保留了关键的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable
generalization in robotics but are restricted by their substantial size and
computational cost, limiting real-world deployment. However, conventional
lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic
intelligence. A video demonstration is available at:

Conclusion: 双臂非抓取操作框架（BiNoMaP）为复杂操作任务提供了新的解决方案，并展现了广泛的适应性。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and
smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The
open-source implementation is available at

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏奖励的多智能体强化学习（MARL）中，现有好奇心机制无法有效区分环境噪声与有意义的新颖性，且忽略了同伴行为的新颖性，导致探索效率低下。

Method: 受人类儿童观察同伴行为的启发，提出CERMIC框架，动态校准内在好奇心并生成理论支持的内在奖励。

Result: 在VMAS、Meltingpot和SMACv2等基准测试中，CERMIC显著优于现有最优算法。

Conclusion: CERMIC通过结合多智能体上下文，为稀疏奖励环境提供了高效的探索策略。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

Conclusion: 平滑的滤波器和低条件数的噪声协方差可以显著提高隐私保护效果，为网络信息安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from
privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system
simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series
outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal
excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift
operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we
study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from
identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show
that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for
the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of
the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals,
the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine
the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance
yielding greater privacy.

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) is regarded as a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems.
However, conventional fixed antenna arrays limit the ability of UAVs to fully
exploit their inherent potential. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
UAV-enabled ISAC framework equipped with fluid antenna (FA) arrays, where the
mobility of antenna elements introduces additional spatial degrees of freedom
to simultaneously enhance communication and sensing performance. A
multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize the
communication rates of multiple users while minimizing the Cram\'er-Rao bound
(CRB) for single-target angle estimation. Due to excessively frequent updates
of FA positions may lead to response delays, a three-timescale optimization
framework is developed to jointly design transmit beamforming, FA positions,
and UAV trajectory based on their characteristics. To solve the non-convexity
of the problem, an alternating optimization-based algorithm is developed to
obtain a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme
significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, validating the
effectiveness of integrating the FA technology into the UAV-enabled ISAC
systems.

Result: RMC-SC码显著减少了短环数量并实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: RMC-SC码提供了一种高效且灵活的编码设计方案，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they
offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components,
the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In
the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed.
For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions
and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger
codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables
switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while
reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable
SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design
probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is
achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes
memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of
short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability
distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown
distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the
gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of
cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to
design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other
cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC
codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts
and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a
literature-based straightforward scheme.

Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications
in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph
alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with
incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal,

challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across
heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling
accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By
employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++
enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D
reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40%
on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.

Conclusion: SceneWeaver为通用3D环境生成迈出了重要一步，展示了其在高复杂度和多样性场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.
