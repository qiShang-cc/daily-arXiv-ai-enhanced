Selecting the most relevant channels is\ncrucial for improving computational efficiency and ensuring robust insights\ninto neural dynamics. This study introduces the Importance of Channels based on\nEffective Connectivity (ICEC) criterion for quantifying effective connectivity\n(EC) in each channel. Effective connectivity refers to the causal influence one\nneural region exerts over another, providing insights into the directional flow\nof information. Using this criterion, we propose an unsupervised channel\nselection method that accounts for the intensity of interactions among\nchannels. To evaluate the proposed channel selection method, we applied it to\nthree well-known EEG datasets across four categories. The assessment involved\ncalculating the ICEC criterion using five effective connectivity metrics:\npartial directed coherence (PDC), generalized PDC (GPDC), renormalized PDC\n(RPDC), directed transfer function (DTF), and direct DTF (dDTF). To focus on\nthe effect of channel selection, we employed the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)\nalgorithm for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for\nclassification across all participants. Results were compared with other\nCSP-based methods. The evaluation included comparing participant- specific\naccuracies with and without the proposed method across five effective\nconnectivity metrics. The results showed consistent performance improvements\nand a significant reduction in the number of selected electrodes for all\nparticipants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieved the\nhighest accuracies: 82% (13 out of 22 channels), 86.01% (29 out of 59\nchannels), and 87.56% (48 out of 118 channels) across three datasets."}

Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis\nis confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across\nrepresentative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on\nsummarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the\ncomplexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in\nspecific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative\nmodels, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative\nloads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can\napproximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour\nbetween substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network\noperation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more\npronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as\nestimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a\nConditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power\nprofiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The\nevaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing\ntemporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results\nshow synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort\nin a wider power systems context. The Conditional Diffusion model is\nbenchmarked against both naive and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate its\neffectiveness in producing realistic scenarios on which to base sub-regional\npower distribution network planning and operations."}

Tactile sensing can compliment vision with its robustness to occlusion,\nbut its temporal sparsity necessitates careful online exploration to maintain\ndata efficiency. Direct contact can also cause an unrestrained object to move,\nrequiring both shape and location estimation. In this work, we propose a\nlearning and exploration framework that uses only tactile data to\nsimultaneously determine the shape and location of rigid objects with minimal\nrobot motion. We build on recent advances in contact-rich system identification\nto formulate a loss function that penalizes physical constraint violation\nwithout introducing the numerical stiffness inherent in rigid-body contact.\nOptimizing this loss, we can learn cuboid and convex polyhedral geometries with\nless than 10s of randomly collected data after first contact. Our exploration\nscheme seeks to maximize Expected Information Gain and results in significantly\nfaster learning in both simulated and real-robot experiments.

Noting that\nwell-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample\nefficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of\nsimplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain\nembeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in\nsparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen\npolicy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial\nembeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across\na variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in\nruntime speed."}

The codebase provides\nimplementations of commonly-used motion-imitation techniques and RL algorithms.\nThis framework is intended to support research and applications in computer\ngraphics and robotics by providing a unified training framework, along with\nstandardized environment, agent, and data structures. The codebase is designed\nto be modular and easily configurable, enabling convenient modification and\nextension to new characters and tasks. The open-source codebase is available\nat: https://github.com/xbpeng/MimicKit."}
