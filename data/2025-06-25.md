Motivation: 密集部署的接入点在无小区大规模MIMO系统中带来高成本和前传需求，需寻找更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合波束成形框架，结合SIM和数字处理，并通过交替优化算法解决联合优化问题。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效降低成本并提升性能，适用于无小区大规模MIMO系统。

Abstract: As the dense deployment of access points (APs) in cell-free massive
multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems presents significant
challenges, per-AP coverage can be expanded using large-scale antenna arrays
(LAAs). However, this approach incurs high implementation costs and substantial
fronthaul demands due to the need for dedicated RF chains for all antennas. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid beamforming framework that
integrates wave-domain beamforming via stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM)
with conventional digital processing. By dynamically manipulating
electromagnetic waves, SIM-equipped APs enhance beamforming gains while
significantly reducing RF chain requirements. We formulate a joint optimization
problem for digital and wave-domain beamforming along with fronthaul
compression to maximize the weighted sum-rate for both uplink and downlink
transmission under finite-capacity fronthaul constraints. Given the high
dimensionality and non-convexity of the problem, we develop alternating
optimization-based algorithms that iteratively optimize digital and wave-domain
variables. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid schemes
outperform conventional hybrid schemes, that rely on randomly set wave-domain
beamformers or restrict digital beamforming to simple power control. Moreover,
the proposed scheme employing sufficiently deep SIMs achieves near
fully-digital performance with fewer RF chains in most simulated cases, except
in the downlink at low signal-to-noise ratios.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个基于大规模EEG数据集的竞赛，包含两项挑战：一是要求模型零样本解码新任务和新受试者的EEG数据，二是预测心理健康相关的人格特质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够跨任务和个体泛化的EEG解码模型，为计算精神病学和神经技术提供突破。

Result: 利用包含3000多名受试者的多任务EEG数据集，推动EEG解码模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 竞赛成果可能为计算精神病学和临床研究提供新方向，促进个性化治疗和基础神经科学的进步。

Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on
small numbers of subjects performing a single task. Here, we introduce a
large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges.
First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that
can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second,
the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer
subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an
unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128
channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in
multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network
baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and
demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across
tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of
adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly,
predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might
identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of
personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances
spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational
psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both
fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.

### [3] [From High-SNR Radar Signal to ECG: A Transfer Learning Model with Cardio-Focusing Algorithm for Scenarios with Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19358)
*Yuanyuan Zhang,Haocheng Zhao,Sijie Xiong,Rui Yang,Eng Gee Lim,Yutao Yue*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种用于雷达信号中ECG恢复的心跳聚焦与追踪（CFT）算法和迁移学习模型（RFcardi），解决了新场景下数据稀缺问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有雷达信号恢复ECG方法依赖高质量信号和大量训练数据，新场景数据稀缺限制了应用。

Method: 提出CFT算法精确追踪心脏位置，确保高质量信号采集；设计RFcardi模型利用心脏特征稀疏性提取信息，仅需少量雷达-ECG对微调预训练模型。

Result: CFT能动态识别心脏位置，RFcardi在小样本训练后可生成高保真ECG恢复结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在新场景下ECG恢复中具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been
successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the
performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous
radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due
to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery
in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking
(CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient
acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning
model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the
radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of
cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to
fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results
reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and
the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using
a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are
available after the publication.

### [4] [Holographic Communication via Recordable and Reconfigurable Metasurface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19376)
*Jinzhe Wang,Qinghua Guo,Xiaojun Yuan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于可记录和可重构超曲面（RRM）的新型全息通信方案，无需信道估计即可实现与传统方案相近的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于可重构全息表面（RHS）的方案需要信道状态信息（CSI），而信道估计在超曲面通信中具有挑战性。受全息术记录和重建过程的启发，提出了一种无需信道估计的新方案。

Method: 引入可记录和可重构超曲面（RRM），利用全息术的记录过程替代传统的信道估计。

Result: 提出的RRM方案无需信道估计，性能与需要完美CSI的RHS方案相当。

Conclusion: RRM方案为未来无线通信网络提供了一种有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Holographic surface based communication technologies are anticipated to play
a significant role in the next generation of wireless networks. The existing
reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS)-based scheme only utilizes the
reconstruction process of the holographic principle for beamforming, where the
channel sate information (CSI) is needed. However, channel estimation for CSI
acquirement is a challenging task in metasurface based communications. In this
study, inspired by both the recording and reconstruction processes of
holography, we develop a novel holographic communication scheme by introducing
recordable and reconfigurable metasurfaces (RRMs), where channel estimation is
not needed thanks to the recording process. Then we analyze the input-output
mutual information of the RRM-based communication system and compare it with
the existing RHS based system. Our results show that, without channel
estimation, the proposed scheme achieves performance comparable to that of the
RHS scheme with perfect CSI, suggesting a promising alternative for future
wireless communication networks.

### [5] [Low-Complexity Semantic Packet Aggregation for Token Communication via Lookahead Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19451)
*Seunghun Lee,Jihong Park,Jinho Choi,Hyuncheol Park*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为SemPA-Look的新框架，通过优化令牌分组来在中断通道下最大化原始和接收令牌消息之间的平均令牌相似度（ATS）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于令牌的语义依赖于上下文，中断通道中单个令牌的丢失会显著扭曲原始语义，因此需要优化令牌分组以保持语义完整性。

Method: 提出了SemPA-Look框架，结合残差语义分数（RSS）和前瞻搜索算法，以线性复杂度实现语义保留。

Result: 在MS-COCO数据集上的实验表明，SemPA-Look在保持高ATS和LPIPS分数的情况下，将计算复杂度降低了40倍。

Conclusion: SemPA-Look在远程AIGC和其他令牌通信应用中展现出高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling
remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike
traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each
token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency
makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can
significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this
paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token
similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage
channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is
combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To
address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with
lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces
the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the
message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain
token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a
lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates
without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates
sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.
Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned
images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores
comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up
to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the
genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity,
demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.

### [6] [Coherent and Noncoherent Detection in Dense Arrays: Can We Ignore Mutual Coupling?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19470)
*Aniol Martí,Luca Sanguinetti,Jaume Riba,Meritxell Lamarca*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了密集天线部署下互耦合对MIMO系统的影响，比较了相干与非相干检测的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主要动机是探讨互耦合对MIMO系统性能的影响，尤其是在天线间距较小的情况下，如何选择更稳健的检测方法。

Method: 基于多端口通信理论，分析了单用户上行链路中忽略互耦合效应的相干和非相干检测方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相干检测虽精度更高，但对耦合模型失配非常敏感，天线间距过小时性能急剧下降；而非相干检测误差较高但对模型失配更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 结论是尽管相干检测通常更准确，但在密集天线部署下，非相干检测因其鲁棒性更可能成为实用选择。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of mutual coupling on MIMO systems with
densely deployed antennas. Leveraging multiport communication theory, we
analyze both coherent and noncoherent detection approaches in a single-user
uplink scenario where the receiver ignores mutual coupling effects. Simulation
results indicate that while coherent detection is generally more accurate, it
is highly sensitive to mismatches in the coupling model, leading to severe
performance degradation when antennas are closely spaced, to the point of
becoming unusable. Noncoherent detection, on the other hand, exhibits a higher
error probability but is more robust to coupling model mismatches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经崩溃理论的深度监督联邦学习算法(NCDSFL)，用于解决无线网络中数据异构性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来无线网络依赖AI，但训练数据质量受限于部分观测环境，联邦学习虽能解决观测局限，但面临数据异构性挑战。

Method: 提出神经崩溃(Neural Collapse, NC)启发的深度监督联邦学习算法(NCDSFL)。

Result: 未明确提及。

Conclusion: 通过NCDSFL算法有望解决联邦学习中的数据异构性问题。

Abstract: Future wireless networks are expected to be AI-empowered, making their
performance highly dependent on the quality of training datasets. However,
physical-layer entities often observe only partial wireless environments
characterized by different power delay profiles. Federated learning is capable
of addressing this limited observability, but often struggles with data
heterogeneity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a neural collapse (NC)
inspired deep supervised federated learning (NCDSFL) algorithm.

Abstract: Localization of in-body devices is beneficial for Gastrointestinal (GI)
diagnosis and targeted treatment. Traditional methods such as imaging and
endoscopy are invasive and limited in resolution, highlighting the need for
innovative alternatives. This study presents an experimental framework for
Radio Frequency (RF)-backscatter-based in-body localization, inspired by the
ReMix approach, and evaluates its performance in real-world conditions. The
experimental setup includes an in-body backscatter device and various off-body
antenna configurations to investigate harmonic generation and reception in air,
chicken and pork tissues. The results indicate that optimal backscatter device
positioning, antenna selection, and gain settings significantly impact
performance, with denser biological tissues leading to greater attenuation. The
study also highlights challenges such as external interference and plastic
enclosures affecting propagation. The findings emphasize the importance of
interference mitigation and refined propagation models to enhance performance.

Result: 原型系统验证了分布式麦克风阵列的无线数据采集和同步能力。

Conclusion: 该系统为可扩展的超声阵列奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present a novel system architecture for a distributed wireless,
self-calibrating ultrasound microphone network for synchronized in-air acoustic
sensing. Once deployed the embedded nodes determine their position in the
environment using the infrared optical tracking system found in the HTC Vive
Lighthouses. After self-calibration, the nodes start sampling the ultrasound
microphone while embedding a synchronization signal in the data which is
established using a wireless Sub-1GHz RF link. Data transmission is handled via
the Wi-Fi 6 radio that is embedded in the nodes' SoC, decoupling
synchronization from payload transport. A prototype system with a limited
amount of network nodes was used to verify the proposed distributed microphone
array's wireless data acquisition and synchronization capabilities. This
architecture lays the groundwork for scalable, deployable ultrasound arrays for
sound source localization applications in bio-acoustic research and industrial
acoustic monitoring.

### [11] [On Error Rate Approximations for FSO Systems with Weak Turbulence and Pointing Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19627)
*Carmen Álvarez Roa,Yunus Can Gültekin,Kaiquan Wu,Cornelis Willem Korevaar,Alex Alvarado*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了在弱湍流环境下针对PAM调制系统的简单且准确的BER和SER近似表达式，并通过数值结果和渐近分析验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自由空间光传输的性能受到大气衰减、湍流、几何扩展和指向误差的影响，现有模型是积分形式，难以直接计算BER和SER。

Method: 提出了一种简单且准确的近似方法，用于计算弱湍流下的平均BER和SER，并通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证其准确性。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的近似表达式具有很高的准确性，并通过两个渐近分析展示了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 本文提出的近似表达式为自由空间光传输系统的性能分析提供了实用的工具，尤其是在高谱效率和大传输功率的情况下。

Abstract: Atmospheric attenuation, atmospheric turbulence, geometric spread, and
pointing errors, degrade the performance of free-space optical transmission. In
the weak turbulence regime, the probability density function describing the
distribution of the channel fading coefficient that models these four effects
is known in the literature. This function is an integral equation, which makes
it difficult to find simple analytical expressions of important performance
metrics such as the bit error rate (BER) and symbol error rate (SER). In this
paper, we present simple and accurate approximations of the average BER and SER
for pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) in the weak turbulence regime for an
intensity modulation and direct detection system. Our numerical results show
that the proposed expressions exhibit excellent accuracy when compared against
Monte Carlo simulations. To demonstrate the usefulness of the developed
approximations, we perform two asymptotic analyses. First, we investigate the
additional transmit power required to maintain the same SER when the spectral
efficiency increases by 1 bit/symbol. Second, we study the asymptotic behavior
of our SER approximation for dense PAM constellations and high transmit power.

*Felipe Villenas,Kaiquan Wu,Yunus Can Gültekin,Jamal Riani,Alex Alvarado*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于400 Gb/s及更高速度的IM-DD光链路的符号错误率（SER）分析模型，考虑了信号依赖性噪声（RIN），适用于概率和几何整形系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据中心对高速传输的需求增加，400 Gb/s/lane及更高的速率成为目标，但增加系统带宽或调制格式需要保持或提高信噪比（SNR）。高光功率引入了信号依赖性噪声（RIN），限制了系统性能。

Method: 开发了一个通用的符号错误率（SER）分析表达式，考虑了RIN的信号依赖性，不依赖星座的几何形状或概率分布假设。

Result: 提出的SER表达式与概率和几何整形系统的数值模拟结果完全匹配。

Conclusion: 该表达式为高速IM-DD系统提供了准确的性能分析工具，适用于未来数据中心的超高速光通信链路。

Abstract: Next-generation intensity-modulation (IM) and direct-detection (DD) systems
used in data centers are expected to operate at 400 Gb/s/lane and beyond. Such
rates can be achieved by increasing the system bandwidth or the modulation
format, which in turn requires maintaining or increasing the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR). Such SNR requirements can be achieved by increasing the
transmitted optical power. This increase in optical power causes the emergence
of relative intensity noise (RIN), a signal-dependent impairment inherent to
the transmitter laser, which ultimately limits the performance of the system.
In this paper, we develop an analytical symbol error rate (SER) expression for
the optimal detector for the IM-DD optical link under study. The developed
expression takes into account the signal-dependent nature of RIN and does not
make any assumptions on the geometry or probability distribution of the
constellation. Our expression is therefore applicable to general
probabilistically and/or geometrically shaped systems. Unlike results available
in the literature, our proposed expression provides a perfect match to
numerical simulations of probabilistic and geometrically shaped systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统航空航天结构损伤检测方法精度与灵敏度不足，通常需要多个传感器，而拓扑声波传感技术能够捕捉声场的几何相移，检测微小扰动。

Method: 该方法提取Lamb波响应信号的几何相移指数（GPS-I）指示损伤位置，并通过Abaqus/CAE建立有限元模型进行验证。

Result: 结果表明，该方法能快速准确定位板结构的损伤位置，仅需损伤板上少量响应信号且无需参考。

Conclusion: 提出的拓扑声波传感技术为结构损伤检测提供了高效、精准且参考无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional structural damage detection methods in aerospace applications
face challenges in accuracy and sensitivity, often necessitating multiple
sensors to evaluate various measurement paths between the reference and
defective states. However, the recently developed topological acoustic (TA)
sensing technique can capture shifts in the geometric phase of an acoustic
field, enabling the detection of even minor perturbations in the supporting
medium. In this study, a diagnostic imaging method for damage detection in
plate structures based on the TA sensing technique is presented. The method
extracts the geometric phase shift index (GPS-I) from the Lamb wave response
signals to indicate the location of the damage. Using Abaqus/CAE, a finite
element model of the plate was established to simulate the Lamb wave response
signals, which were then used to validate the feasibility of the proposed
method. The results indicate that this technique enables rapid and precise
identification of damage and its location within the plate structure, requiring
response signals from only a few points on the damaged plate, and it is
reference-free.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于谐波结构的F0估计算法在FFR中的应用，引入了刺激感知滤波器和谐波幅度求和法，显著降低了F0估计的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有方法在FFR中F0估计性能不佳的问题，特别是在F0变化时，本文提出了新的方法以提高准确性。

Method: 采用谐波幅度求和（HAS）方法，通过刺激感知滤波器选择性地聚合F0及其谐波幅度，抑制非谐波频率的噪声。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在16名听力正常被试中对4种自然语音刺激的F0估计误差平均降低了8.8%至47.4%。

Conclusion: 提出的HAS方法是首个针对FFR的基于谐波结构的F0估计算法，显著优于传统的ACF方法。

Abstract: The Frequency Following Response (FFR) reflects the brain's neural encoding
of auditory stimuli including speech. Because the fundamental frequency (F0), a
physical correlate of pitch, is one of the essential features of speech, there
has been particular interest in characterizing the FFR at F0, especially when
F0 varies over time. The standard method for extracting F0 in FFRs has been the
Autocorrelation Function (ACF). This paper investigates
harmonic-structure-based F0 estimation algorithms, originally developed for
speech and music, and resolves their poor performance when applied to FFRs in
two steps. Firstly, given that unlike in speech or music, stimulus F0 of FFRs
is already known, we introduce a stimulus-aware filterbank that selectively
aggregates amplitudes at F0 and its harmonics while suppressing noise at
non-harmonic frequencies. This method, called Harmonic Amplitude Summation
(HAS), evaluates F0 candidates only within a range centered around the stimulus
F0. Secondly, unlike other pitch tracking methods that select the highest peak,
our method chooses the most prominent one, as it better reflects the underlying
periodicity of FFRs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
propose an F0 estimation algorithm for FFRs that relies on harmonic structure.
Analyzing recorded FFRs from 16 normal hearing subjects to 4 natural speech
stimuli with a wide F0 variation from 89 Hz to 452 Hz showed that this method
outperformed ACF by reducing the average Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) within
each response and stimulus F0 contour pair by 8.8% to 47.4%, depending on the
stimulus.

### [15] [Tangent Space Causal Inference: Leveraging Vector Fields for Causal Discovery in Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23499)
*Kurt Butler,Daniel Waxman,Petar M. Djurić*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TSCI的新方法，用于在动态系统中更准确地检测因果性，优于传统的CCM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果发现在时间序列数据中非常重要，但传统方法如Granger因果关系在动态系统中不可靠，CCM方法也因数据质量而表现不佳。

Method: TSCI通过将向量场作为系统动态的显式表示，并检查学习到的向量场之间的同步程度来检测因果性。该方法模型无关，且可以替代CCM及其泛化方法。

Result: TSCI在基准任务中表现出优于CCM的性能，且计算开销增加很小。

Conclusion: TSCI是一种更有效的动态系统因果推断方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Causal discovery with time series data remains a challenging yet increasingly
important task across many scientific domains. Convergent cross mapping (CCM)
and related methods have been proposed to study time series that are generated
by dynamical systems, where traditional approaches like Granger causality are
unreliable. However, CCM often yields inaccurate results depending upon the
quality of the data. We propose the Tangent Space Causal Inference (TSCI)
method for detecting causalities in dynamical systems. TSCI works by
considering vector fields as explicit representations of the systems' dynamics
and checks for the degree of synchronization between the learned vector fields.
The TSCI approach is model-agnostic and can be used as a drop-in replacement
for CCM and its generalizations. We first present a basic version of the TSCI
algorithm, which is shown to be more effective than the basic CCM algorithm
with very little additional computation. We additionally present augmented
versions of TSCI that leverage the expressive power of latent variable models
and deep learning. We validate our theory on standard systems, and we
demonstrate improved causal inference performance across a number of benchmark
tasks.

Conclusion: PQS是一种高效方法，适用于资源受限的电磁结构设计，优于现有生成方法。

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product
designing cycle.

TL;DR: 比较移动天线（MA）与无人机（UAV）在提升物理层安全中的性能，发现MA在低功耗场景表现优异，UAV在高资源条件下更优，建议混合使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机因高能耗和复杂轨迹优化受限，MA技术则能提供低能耗、快速响应的空间重构，需系统比较两者在物理层安全中的应用。

Method: 提出双尺度移动框架，分别优化MA的微移动（天线位置和波束成形）和UAV的宏移动（轨迹和波束成形），并进行仿真。

Result: MA在低功耗或天线受限时表现优，UAV在高资源条件下更优，两者互补。

Conclusion: 建议结合MA和UAV的混合移动方案，以平衡安全性、能效和部署复杂度。

Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of movable antenna (MA)-enabled
micro-mobility to replace UAV-enabled macro-mobility for enhancing physical
layer security (PLS) in air-to-ground communications. While UAV trajectory
optimization offers high flexibility and Line-of-Sight (LoS) advantages, it
suffers from significant energy consumption, latency, and complex trajectory
optimization. Conversely, MA technology provides fine-grained spatial
reconfiguration (antenna positioning within a confined area) with ultra-low
energy overhead and millisecond-scale response, enabling real-time channel
manipulation and covert beam steering. To systematically compare these
paradigms, we establish a dual-scale mobility framework where a UAV-mounted
uniform linear array (ULA) serves as a base station transmitting confidential
information to a legitimate user (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper
(Eve). We formulate non-convex average secrecy rate (ASR) maximization problems
for both schemes: 1) MA-based micro-mobility: Jointly optimizing antenna
positions and beamforming (BF) vectors under positioning constraints; 2)
UAV-based macro-mobility: Jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and BF
vectors under kinematic constraints. Extensive simulations reveal distinct
operational regimes: MA micro-mobility demonstrates significant ASR advantages
in low-transmit-power scenarios or under antenna constraints due to its
energy-efficient spatial control. Conversely, UAV macro-mobility excels under
resource-sufficient conditions (higher power, larger antenna arrays) by
leveraging global mobility for optimal positioning. The findings highlight the
complementary strengths of both approaches, suggesting hybrid micro-macro
mobility as a promising direction for balancing security, energy efficiency,
and deployment complexity in future wireless networks.

Abstract: Towards future 6G wireless networks, low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have
been widely considered as a promising component to enhance the terrestrial
communications. To ensure the link reliability of high-mobility satellite
communication scenarios, the emerging orthogonal delay-Doppler division
multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has attracted significant research attention. In
this paper, we study the diversity gain achieved by ODDM modulation along with
the mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. Additionally, we propose
an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm based detector to
harvest the diversity gain promised by ODDM modulation. By operating the linear
and non-linear estimator iteratively, the orthogonal approximate message
passing (OAMP) detector can utilize the sparsity of the effective delay-Doppler
(DD) domain channel and extract the full diversity. Simulation results reveal
the relationship between diversity gain and system parameters, and demonstrate
that our proposed detector can achieve better performance than the conventional
message passing methods with significantly reduced complexity.
