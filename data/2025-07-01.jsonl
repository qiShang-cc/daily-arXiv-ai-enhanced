Nodes can employ single-hop communication which, despite its\nease, may necessitate energy-intensive long-range communication to cover long\ndistances. Conversely, multi-hop communication allows for more energy-efficient\nshort-range communication since nodes can rely on other nodes to forward their\ndata. Yet, this approach requires relay nodes to be available and continuous\nmaintenance of a dynamically changing distributed state. At the same time,\nenergy harvesting has the potential to outperform traditional battery-based\nsystems by improving their lifetime, scalability with lower maintenance costs,\nand environmental impact. However, the limited and temporally and spatially\nvariable harvested energy poses significant challenges for networking in energy\nharvesting networks, particularly considering the energy demands and\ncharacteristics of both multi-hop and single-hop communication. We propose\nE-WAN, a protocol for energy harvesting wide-area low-power networks that\nbuilds on the concept of \\emph{virtual sub-networks} to enable\nresource-efficient multi-hop communication when possible and reliable however\nenergy-intensive point-to-point communication otherwise. Nodes autonomously and\ndynamically move between the two and adjust to changing network states and\nresources based only on easily obtainable network state information. We\nillustrate E-WAN's advantages both in terms of efficiency and adaptability in\nvarious communication and harvesting scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nE-WAN operating in a realistic setting by deploying an energy harvesting\nnetwork in a real-world indoor environment."}

To address this challenge, we employ a joint design that combines an\nMA array with a frequency-diverse array (FDA) at the transmitter to secure the\ntransmission across both range and direction. Specifically, we derive\nclosed-form expressions for the optimal antenna positions and frequency shifts,\nassuming small perturbations in both parameters from a linear frequency-diverse\nMA configuration.

This paper introduces the Trilinear\nAlgorithm and isomorphic to algorithm Device Architecture (TriADA) to address\nthese challenges with the following innovations: (1) a massively parallel,\nlow-rank algorithm for computing a family of trilinear (3D) discrete orthogonal\ntransformations (3D-DXTs), which is a special case of the more general 3-mode\nmatrix-by-tensor multiplication (3D-GEMT); (2) a new outer-product-based GEMM\nkernel with decoupled streaming active memory, specially designed to accelerate\n3D-GEMT operation; (3) an isomorphic to the proposed algorithm, fully\ndistributed 3D network of mesh interconnected processing elements or cells with\na coordinate-free, data-driven local processing activity, which is independent\nof problem size; (4) an elastic sparse outer-product (ESOP) method that avoids\nunnecessary computing and communication operations with zero-valued operands,\nthereby enhancing energy efficiency, computational accuracy, and stability.\nTriADA is capable of performing a variety of trilinear transformations with\nhypercubic arithmetic complexity in a linear number of time-steps. The\nmassively parallel, scalable, and energy-efficient architecture of TriADA is\nideal for accelerating multilinear tensor operations, which are the most\ndemanding parts of AI and HPC workloads."}

While\nrecent EEG foundation models advance generalized decoding via unified\narchitectures and large-scale pretraining, they adopt a scale-agnostic dense\nmodeling paradigm inherited from NLP and vision. This design neglects a core\nproperty of neural activity: cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. EEG task\npatterns span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from short bursts to\nslow rhythms, and from localized cortical responses to distributed\ninteractions. Ignoring this diversity leads to suboptimal representations and\nweak generalization. We propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain\nfoundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces: (i)\nCross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale\nfeatures from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into\ncompact scale-aware tokens; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which\ncaptures cross-window and cross-region dependencies, enhancing scale diversity\nwhile removing spurious correlations. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to\nprogressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on 11 EEG tasks\nacross 16 datasets show that CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and\nfoundation model baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a\nkey inductive bias and position CSBrain as a robust backbone for future\nbrain-AI research."}

This basic representation of the\nelliptic model can be made more accurate, rich, and flexible by considering\nadditional \\textit{finite-dimensional nuisance} parameters. Our aim is\ntherefore to investigate the deep and counter-intuitive links between\nstatistical efficiency in estimating the parameters of interest in the presence\nof both finite and infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters. Unlike previous\nworks that addressed this problem using Le Cam's asymptotic theory, our\napproach here is purely geometric: efficiency will be analyzed using tools such\nas projections and tangent spaces embedded in the relevant Hilbert space.

In the\nproposed scheme, coded bits from two users are split and assigned to one shared\nsymbol and two private symbols carried by different beams. Based on joint\nsymbol mapping of H-QAM constellations and phase-aligned precoding at the\ntransmitter, each receiver observes a different H-QAM constellation with Gray\nmapping, a unique parallax feature not shared by existing schemes. In addition\nto avoiding successive interference cancellation (SIC), each user independently\ndemodulates its own bits on separate I and Q branches with calculations based\non closed-form expressions. Hence the receiver complexity is on par with that\nof orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which is much lower than that in other\ncompeting alternatives such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and\nrate-splitting multiple access (RSMA).

In this work, we present a collaborative beamforming-based\nphysical layer security scheme for LAWNs.

Following this, we highlight\nseveral opportunities for collaborative UAV swarm secure applications enabled\nby satellite networks, including achieving physical layer security in scenarios\ninvolving data dissemination, data relay, eavesdropper collusion, and imperfect\neavesdropper information.

We derive an expression for the expected duration of\nLoS between a static UAV in the air and a mobile ground user, and validate the\nsame through simulations. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed analysis,\nwe propose a simple user association algorithm that greedily assigns the UAVs\nto users with the highest expected LoS time, and show that it outperforms the\nexisting benchmark schemes that assign the users to the nearest UAVs with LoS\nwithout considering the user mobility."}
