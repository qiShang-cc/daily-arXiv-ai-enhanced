To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a Rotating element Harmonic Electric-field Vector\n(RHEV) strategy, which enables precise calibration through time modulation\nprinciples. The proposed technique functions as follows. Two 1-bit phase\nshifters are periodically phase-switched at the same frequency, each generating\ncorresponding harmonics.

Realizing half-wavelength spaced planar phased arrays\nis challenging due to wavelength-integrated circuit (IC) size conflict at those\nfrequencies where the antenna dimensions are comparable to IC size. Therefore,\nirregular array architectures such as thinned and clustered arrays are\ndeveloped to mitigate the wavelength-IC size conflict. In the thinned arrays,\nradiating elements are permanently deactivated, while in clustered arrays,\nneighboring elements are grouped into subarrays. Furthermore, irregular arrays\nare integrated with hybrid beamforming architectures to manage the complexity\nintroduced by full digital beamforming, where a single radio frequency chain is\nconnected per power amplifier. An optimization problem is formulated to\ndetermine the optimal arrangement of antenna elements where the trade-off\nbetween spectral efficiency (SE) and sidelobe levels (SLL) can be tuned.\nClustered array configurations are optimized by genetic algorithm and\nAlgorithm-X based methodologies, where the former relies on a randomized search\nand the latter exploits brute-force search, respectively. Furthermore, a\nprototype array is designed on a printed circuit board (PCB) to verify the\nproposed methodologies through full-wave simulations. To have a fair\ncomparison, clustered arrays with a grouping of two and four elements are\ncompared with thinned arrays with half and quarter thinning ratios,\nrespectively. The combination of hybrid and irregular array architectures leads\nto minimal or no performance degradation in the case of hybrid fully connected\narchitectures but severe SE and SLL degradation in the case of hybrid partially\nconnected architectures, respectively."}

Key advantages include enhanced\nspectral and energy efficiency, expanded network coverage, and flexible\ndeployment. One of the main challenges in employing UAV-mounted IRS (UMI)\ntechnology is the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Focusing on this\nchallenge, this paper explores the capabilities of UMI with passive/active\nelements affected by UAV fluctuations in both horizontal and vertical angles,\nconsidering the three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the IRS. The\nrelationship between UAV fluctuations and IRS pattern is investigated by taking\ninto account the random angular vibrations of UAVs. A tractable and closed-form\ndistribution function for the IRS pattern is derived, using linear\napproximation and by dividing it into several sectors. In addition, closed-form\nexpressions for outage probability (OP) are obtained using central limit\ntheorem (CLT) and Gamma approximation. The theoretical expressions are\nvalidated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings indicate that the\nrandom fluctuations of hovering UAVs have a notable impact on the performance\nof UMI systems. To avoid link interruptions due to UAV instability, IRS should\nutilize fewer elements, even though this leads to a decrease in directivity. As\na result, unlike terrestrial IRS, incorporating more elements into aerial IRS\nsystems does not necessarily improve performance due to the fluctuations in\nUAV. Numerical results show that the OP can be minimized by selecting the\noptimal number of IRS elements and using active elements."}

We present a mathematical framework based on\nsecond-order cumulant to devise a second-order extended co-array (SO-ECA) and\ndefine the redundancy of SO-ECA.

The BS and the MSs are equipped with uniform rectangular\narrays, and the MSs are located in the near-field region of the BS array. To\navoid the difficulty of tackling the problem directly based on the near-field\nsignal model, we establish a subarray-wise far-field received signal model. In\nthis model, the entire BS array is divided into multiple subarrays to ensure\nthat each MS is in the far-field region of each BS subarray. By exploiting the\nangles of arrival (AoAs) of an MS antenna at different BS subarrays, we\nformulate the attitude and location estimation problem under the Bayesian\ninference framework.

In many multiobject tracking applications, including radar\nand sonar tracking, after coherent prefiltering of the received signal,\nmeasurement data is typically structured in cells, where each cell represent,\ne.g., a different range and bearing value. While conventional detect-then-track\n(DTT) multiobject tracking approaches convert the cell-structured data within a\ndetection phase into so-called point measurements in order to reduce the amount\nof data, track-before-detect (TBD) methods process the cell-structured data\ndirectly, avoiding a potential information loss. However, many TBD tracking\nmethods are computationally intensive and achieve a reduced tracking accuracy\nwhen objects interact, i.e., when they come into close proximity. We here\ncounteract these difficulties by introducing the concept of probabilistic\nobject-to-cell contributions. As many conventional DTT methods, our approach\nuses a probabilistic association of objects with data cells, and a new object\ncontribution model with corresponding object contribution probabilities to\nfurther associate cell contributions to objects that occupy the same data cell.\nFurthermore, to keep the computational complexity and filter runtimes low, we\nhere use an efficient Poisson multi-Bernoulli filtering approach in combination\nwith the application of belief propagation for fast probabilistic data\nassociation.

Most approaches often rely on offline outdated or\noversimplified 3D maps, while real-time LiDAR-based reconstruction boasts high\naccuracy, it is problematic in low laser reflectivity conditions; camera 3DMA\nis a good candidate to balance accuracy and efficiency but current methods\nsuffer from extremely low reconstruction speed, a far cry from real-time\nmultipath-mitigated navigation. This paper proposes an accelerated framework\nincorporating camera multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction and ray tracing. By\nhypothesizing on surface textures, an orthogonal visual feature fusion\nframework is proposed, which robustly addresses both texture-rich and\ntexture-poor surfaces, lifting off the reflectivity challenges in visual\nreconstruction.
