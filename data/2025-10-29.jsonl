Typically, an SIS is\nmodelled as a surface that imparts phase shifts on impinging electromagnetic\nsignals to achieve desired communication objectives. However, this mode of\noperation results in a linear SIS, which limits its applicability to linear\noperations. To unlock further SIS potential, we propose a nonlinear SIS that\ncan mimic the behaviour of nonlinear neural networks. We discuss the\nfeasibility and potential of this idea and propose a nonlinear SIS unit cell\nwith a step-like response. To evaluate the system-level performance of\nnonlinear SIS, we present a case study where SIS structures are optimized to\nminimize the symbol error rate (SER) in an MIMO system with SIS deployed at\nboth the transmitter and receiver sides using only statistical channel\ninformation. We demonstrate that a nonlinear SIS can improve communication\nreliability compared to a linear SIS by forming complex signal patterns across\nthe SIS surface, which provide higher diversity against noise disturbances,\nwhile still allowing the receiver to discern these patterns. Finally, we\noutline several potential applications of nonlinear SIS in wireless\ncommunication scenarios."}

The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that\ngovern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect\nthe group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the\nintent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic\nfunction of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy\nobservations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a\nFisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which\nyields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal\npatterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based\ngenerative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic\nmulti-target trajectory data.

This paper introduces Smart Sensing Feedback (SSF), a\nlimited-feedback framework designed to enhance sensing capabilities while\nmaintaining communication performance. SSF adapts the concept of retransmission\nfrom communication to sensing. Specifically, we focus on downlink (DL) bistatic\nsensing, where the User Equipment (UE) performs measurements from reflected\nsensing signals and provides feedback to the network (NW). In sensing services,\nUE reporting can vary significantly due to dynamic factors such as target\ncharacteristics, environmental conditions, and UE status. Our results\ndemonstrate that SSF significantly improves sensing quality while preserving\ncommunication efficiency. Additionally, it enhances key performance metrics\nsuch as probability of detection, latency, and power consumption.

One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these\nsystems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to that of\nhumans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style\nmanipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors, which we name HMAMP.\nThe approach leverages adversarial networks to model the complex dynamics of\ntool and object manipulation, as well as the aim of the manipulation task. The\ndiscriminator is trained using a combination of real-world data and simulation\ndata executed by the agent, which is designed to train a policy that generates\nrealistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human\nmotion. We evaluated HMAMP on one challenging manipulation task: hammering, and\nthe results indicate that HMAMP is capable of learning human-style manipulation\nskills that outperform current baseline methods.

In this work, a wideband digital reflective metasurface is\npresented for capable of dynamically controlling EM waves, with multifunctional\napplications in the lower-frequency S-band. The metasurface is composed of\nelectronically reconfigurable meta-atoms with wideband characteristics, and\ndesigned by using trapezoidal and M-shaped patches connected by a pin diode.\nSimulation results show that the proposed digital metasurface could achieve\nwideband 1-bit phase quantization with a stable phase difference within 180\ndegree +/- 25 degree and small reflection loss below 0.6 dB from 2.72 to 3.25\nGHz. To validate the proposed design, a 20x20-unit metasurface array was\ndesigned, simulated and fabricated.

In real-world fire scenarios, evacuees frequently deviate from\ndesignated safe routes due to panic and uncertainty. To address these\nchallenges, this paper presents a multi-agent coordination framework in which\nautonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) assist human evacuees in real-time\nby locating, intercepting, and guiding them to safety under uncertain\nconditions. We model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision\nProcess (POMDP), where two heterogeneous UAV agents, a high-level rescuer (HLR)\nand a low-level rescuer (LLR), coordinate through shared observations and\ncomplementary capabilities. Human behavior is captured using an agent-based\nmodel grounded in empirical psychology, where panic dynamically affects\ndecision-making and movement in response to environmental stimuli. The\nenvironment features stochastic fire spread, unknown evacuee locations, and\nlimited visibility, requiring UAVs to plan over long horizons to search for\nhumans and adapt in real-time.
