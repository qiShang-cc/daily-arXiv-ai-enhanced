Unlike conventional single-stage VQ approaches, which require\nexponentially larger codebooks to achieve higher fidelity, the proposed\nframework decomposes the quantization process into multiple stages and\ndynamically activates both stages and individual VQ modules. This design\nenables fine-grained rate adaptation under varying bit constraints while\nmitigating computational complexity and the codebook collapse problem. To\noptimize performance, we formulate a module selection problem that minimizes\ntask loss subject to a rate constraint and solve it using an incremental\nallocation algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the framework by incorporating\nentropy coding to exploit non-uniform codeword distributions, further reducing\ncommunication overhead.

Accepted to the IROS 2025 Workshop on Perception\n  and Planning for Mobile Manipulation in Changing Environments", "summary": "Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are\nlate, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer\nthat leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals\n(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion\nretargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming\nas a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main\ntechnical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that\nmaintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals\nthat maximize expected progress.

Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the\nlinearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global\nlinear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both\nthe nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy\nextended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman\nrealizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that\nonly the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input\ncouplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear\nrealizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path\nplanning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine\nthe optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of\nfinding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC\ncounterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space.\nOur work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for\nlinearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear\nstate and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to\nlinear problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027Koopman\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001-\u8f93\u5165\u8026\u5408\u53ca\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u9879\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u7269\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027MPC\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86320\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfKoopman\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u4ece\u8f93\u5165-\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027Koopman\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MPC\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027Koopman\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001-\u8f93\u5165\u8026\u5408\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u9879\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027MPC\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86320\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027Koopman\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Our approach leverages diverse,\nunconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to\ntrain generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring\nthese policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial\nmanipulators-is the mismatch in control and robot dynamics, which often leads\nto out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we\npropose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level\nUMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.\nBy integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the\ndiffusion sampling process, our method steers trajectory generation towards\ndynamically feasible modes tailored to the deployment embodiment. This enables\nplug-and-play, embodiment-aware trajectory adaptation at test time. We validate\nour approach on multiple long-horizon and high-precision aerial manipulation\ntasks, showing improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under\ndisturbances compared to unguided diffusion baselines.

For a three-dimensional scenario,\nSRP-based methods need to jointly optimize three continuous variables for\nposition estimation or two continuous variables for DOA estimation, which can\nbe computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose novel methods for\nmulti-source position and DOA estimation by exploiting properties of Euclidean\ndistance matrices (EDMs) and their respective Gram matrices. In the proposed\nmulti-source position estimation method only a single continuous variable,\nrepresenting the distance between each source and a reference microphone, needs\nto be optimized. For each source, the optimal continuous distance variable and\nset of candidate time-difference of arrival (TDOA) estimates are determined by\nminimizing a cost function that is defined using the eigenvalues of the Gram\nmatrix. The estimated relative source positions are then mapped to estimated\nabsolute source positions by solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem for each\nsource.

Introducing force information\ninto vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,\nbut could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data\nscarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing\nprocesses are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the\nSim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating\nforce-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human\ndemonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the\nperformance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our\napproach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a\nbi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact\nmaintenance and adaptation to novel conditions.

Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have\nemerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse\nenvironmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small\napertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed\nimage of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large\naperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The\nresulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition\nrepresentation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a\npipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an\nunknown environment.

In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating\nlong, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across\nvarious industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray\ncoating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their\npredefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they\ncan represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.\nMoreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or\nextensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations\nhighlight the need for more expressive generative models, making\ndiffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation.

To this end, we propose to leverage\nthe intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse\nnavigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.\nSpecifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360\nobservations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation\nmodels. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three\nreinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information\nin three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation\ncapabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA\nmodel using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is\ndynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities.

In contrast, Planning\nDomain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal\nplanning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these\ncomplementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into\nPDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem\nfiles satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain\nfiles, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely\non human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access\nfor refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can\nautonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual\nplanning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A\nSimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and\na GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the\nPDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of\ngeneralizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the\ndifferent instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different\nproblems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world\ndomains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game\nrules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,\nsimulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal\nreaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of\nSimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for\nunseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively.
