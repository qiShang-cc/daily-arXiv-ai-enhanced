The proposed design considers a\npractical mean squared error (MSE) constraint between the desired and the\nachieved beampatterns constructed for identifying radar targets (RTs). To\nachieve optimal performance, we formulate an optimization problem relying on\nsum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization of the communication users (CUs),\nwhile satisfying certain radar beampattern similarity (RBPS), total transmit\npower, and constant modulus constraints, where the latter are attributed to the\nhybrid mmWave MIMO architecture. Since the aforementioned problem is non-convex\nand intractable, a sequential approach is proposed wherein the TPCs are\ndesigned first, followed by the RCs. To deal with the non-convex MSE and\nconstant modulus constraints in the TPC design problem, we propose a\nmajorization and minimization (MM) based Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG)\nmethod, which restricts the tolerable MSE of the beampattern to within a\npredefined limit. Moreover, the least squares and the zero-forcing methods are\nadopted for maximizing the sum-SE and for mitigating the multiuser interference\n(MUI), respectively. Furthermore, to design the RC at each CU, we propose a\nlinear MM-based blind combiner (LMBC) scheme that does not rely on the\nknowledge of the TPC at the CUs and has a low complexity. To achieve user\nfairness, we further extend the proposed sequential approach for maximizing the\ngeometric mean (GM) of the CU's rate.

This letter,\nfor the first time, presents a comparative study between the emerging pinching\nantenna systems and RIS in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. Our results reveal\nthat RIS requires an extremely large number of elements (in the order of\n$10^4$) to outperform pinching antenna systems in terms of spectral efficiency,\nwhich severely impact the energy efficiency performance of RIS. Moreover,\npinching antenna systems demonstrate greater robustness against hardware\nimpairments and severe path loss typically encountered in high-frequency mmWave\nbands.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08RIS\uff09\u5728\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RIS\u9700\u8981\u6781\u591a\u7684\u5143\u4ef6\uff08\u7ea610^4\u4e2a\uff09\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u9891\u6bb5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cRIS\u5728\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cRIS\u5728\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u9891\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "RIS\u9700\u8981\u6781\u591a\u7684\u5143\u4ef6\uff08\u7ea610^4\u4e2a\uff09\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u9891\u6bb5\u4e2d\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u9891\u6bb5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u3002"}}

The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as\nWiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that\nenables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different\nbands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network\nthroughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel\nallocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has\npredominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization\nwithin static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses\nthe dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO\ncapabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization\nproblem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the\ninherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a\nMulti-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel\nallocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing\nupper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further\nreduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network\nscenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic\nchannel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into\nthe BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS\nalgorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\\%$ faster than the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\\%$ of the optimal value.

Public\nMobile Network Operators (MNOs), utilizing outdoor macro base stations (BSs),\nsuffer from poor signal penetration.

Shared spectrum models,\nparticularly the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) utilized by private\n4G/5G networks, have emerged as a promising alternative to provide reliable\nindoor service. Moreover, these private networks are equipped with the\nneutral-host (NH) model, seamlessly offloading indoor MNOs' traffic to the\nprivate CBRS network.
