Our model, based on the\nResNet18 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, utilizes\npostoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) center scans as inputs. We\nevaluated the model using both original scans and scans preprocessed with\nenergy crop and wavelet denoising, achieving 72% accuracy on preprocessed\ninputs, outperforming the 66% accuracy achieved on original scans. To further\nimprove accuracy, we integrated tunable wavelet units with two key adaptations:\nOrthogonal Lattice-based Wavelet Units (OrthLatt-UwU) and Perfect\nReconstruction Relaxation-based Wavelet Units (PR-Relax-UwU). These units\nallowed the model to automatically adjust filter coefficients during training\nand were incorporated into downsampling, stride-two convolution, and pooling\nlayers, enhancing its ability to distinguish between ERM-ILM removal and\nERM-alone removal, with OrthLattUwU boosting accuracy to 76% and PR-Relax-UwU\nincreasing performance to 78%. Performance comparisons showed that our AI model\noutperformed a trained human grader, who achieved only 50% accuracy in\nclassifying the removal surgery types from postoperative OCT scans. These\nfindings highlight the potential of CNN based models to improve clinical\ndecision-making by providing more accurate and reliable classifications. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ tunable wavelets for\nclassifying different types of ERM removal surgery."}

In highly dynamic\nenvironments, vehicular platoons experience frequent communication changes and\nresource constraints, which significantly affect information exchange and\nlearning model synchronization. To address these challenges, we first formulate\nWFL in VP as a joint optimization problem that simultaneously considers Age of\nInformation (AoI) and Federated Learning Model Drift (FLMD) to ensure timely\nand accurate control. Through theoretical analysis, we examine the impact of\nFLMD on convergence performance and develop a two-stage Resource-Aware Control\nframework (RACE). The first stage employs a Lagrangian dual decomposition\nmethod for resource configuration, while the second stage implements a\nmulti-agent deep reinforcement learning approach for vehicle selection. The\napproach integrates Multi-Head Self-Attention and Long Short-Term Memory\nnetworks to capture spatiotemporal correlations in communication states.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, the\nproposed framework improves AoI optimization by up to 45%, accelerates learning\nconvergence, and adapts more effectively to dynamic VP environments on the\nAI4MARS dataset."}

However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity\nfor multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and\nfrequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite\nmovement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within\nsingle-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the\nvast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in\nsuboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article\nproposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire\nmulti-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically\nforms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The\nformation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide\ntailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative\nstrategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial\nintelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite\naccess and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS\nsignificantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover\noverhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D\nconnectivity in multi-constellation environments."}

Despite its\nadvancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from\nthe unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC)\nand (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model\nquantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically\naddresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility\nunder both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task.\nIn this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a\nprivacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different\nquantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we\nintroduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously\nachieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the\nproposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To\naddress quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization\ntechnique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation\naccuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms\nof privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional\nLaplaceSQ-FL algorithm."}
