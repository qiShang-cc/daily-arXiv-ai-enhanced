Conclusion: 该方法为iToF系统提供了一种高效、稳定的深度重建解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel compressed sensing method to improve the depth
reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation capability of indirect
Time-of-Flight (iToF) systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
hardware modifications, complex modulation, or cumbersome data-driven
reconstruction, our method operates with a single modulation frequency and
constructs the sensing matrix using multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle
continuous waves. During matrix construction, we further account for pixel-wise
range variation caused by lens distortion, making the sensing matrix better
aligned with actual modulation response characteristics. To enhance sparse
recovery, we apply K-Means clustering to the distance response dictionary and
constrain atom selection within each cluster during the OMP process, which
effectively reduces the search space and improves solution stability.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
traditional approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and robustness, without
requiring any additional hardware changes.

Abstract: Cell-free wireless networks deploy distributed access points (APs) to
simultaneously serve user equipments (UEs) across the service region and are
regarded as one of the most promising network architectural paradigms. Despite
recent advances in the performance analysis and optimization of cellfree
wireless networks, it remains an open question whether large-scale deployment
of APs in existing wireless networks can cost-effectively achieve communication
capacity growth. Besides, the realization of a cell-free network is considered
to be a gradual long-term evolutionary process in which cell-free APs will be
incrementally introduced into existing cellular networks, and form a hybrid
communication network with the existing cellular base stations (BSs). Such a
collaboration will bridge the gap between the established cellular network and
the innovative cellfree network. Therefore, hybrid cellular and cell-free
networks (HCCNs) emerge as a practical and feasible solution for advancing
cell-free network development, and it is worthwhile to further explore its
performance limits. This paper presents a stochastic geometry-based hybrid
cellular and cell-free network model to analyze the distributions of signal and
interference and reveal their mutual coupling. Specifically, in order to
benefit the UEs from both the cellular BSs and the cell-free APs, a conjugate
beamforming design is employed, and the aggregated signal is analyzed using
moment matching. Then, the coverage probability of the hybrid network is
characterized by deriving the Laplace transforms and their higher-order
derivatives of interference components. Furthermore, the average achievable
rate of the hybrid network over channel fading is derived based on the
interference coupling analysis.

Conclusion: 多模态方法有效提升无人机检测与分类能力。

Abstract: The use of drones in a wide range of applications is steadily increasing.
However, this has also raised critical security concerns such as unauthorized
drone intrusions into restricted zones. Therefore, robust and accurate drone
detection and classification mechanisms are required despite significant
challenges due to small size of drones, low-altitude flight, and environmental
noise. In this letter, we propose a multi-modal approach combining radar and
acoustic sensing for detecting and classifying drones. We employ radar due to
its long-range capabilities, and robustness to different weather conditions. We
utilize raw acoustic signals without converting them to other domains such as
spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. This enables us to use
fewer number of parameters compared to the stateof-the-art approaches.
Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of the transformer encoder
architecture in fusing these sensors. Experimental results obtained in outdoor
settings verify the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to
the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing~(ODDM) modulation has recently
been regarded as a promising technology to provide reliable communications in
high-mobility situations. Accurate and low-complexity channel estimation is one
of the most critical challenges for massive multiple input multiple
output~(MIMO) ODDM systems, mainly due to the extremely large antenna arrays
and high-mobility environments. To overcome these challenges, this paper
addresses the issue of channel estimation in downlink massive MIMO-ODDM systems
and proposes a low-complexity algorithm based on memory approximate message
passing~(MAMP) to estimate the channel state information~(CSI). Specifically,
we first establish the effective channel model of the massive MIMO-ODDM
systems, where the magnitudes of the elements in the equivalent channel vector
follow a Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution. Further, as the number of antennas
grows, the elements in the equivalent coefficient matrix tend to become
completely random. Leveraging these characteristics, we utilize the MAMP method
to determine the gains, delays, and Doppler effects of the multi-path channel,
while the channel angles are estimated through the discrete Fourier transform
method. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed channel estimation
algorithm approaches the Bayesian optimal results when the number of antennas
tends to infinity and improves the channel estimation accuracy by about 30%
compared with the existing algorithms in terms of the normalized mean square
error.

similarity index improvement of 4%, thereby supporting downstream sensing and
communication applications.

Conclusion: 论文提出的节能编队框架和双功能波束成形设计为低空无线网络中的无人机编队提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal
technology for advancing low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), serving as a
critical enabler for next-generation communication systems. This paper
investigates the system design for energy-saving unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
formations in dual-functional LAWNs, where a ground base station (GBS)
simultaneously wirelessly controls multiple UAV formations and performs sensing
tasks. To enhance flight endurance, we exploit the aerodynamic upwash effects
and propose a distributed energy-saving formation framework based on the
adapt-then-combine (ATC) diffusion least mean square (LMS) algorithm.
Specifically, each UAV updates the local position estimate by invoking the LMS
algorithm, followed by refining it through cooperative information exchange
with neighbors. This enables an optimized aerodynamic structure that minimizes
the formation's overall energy consumption. To ensure control stability and
fairness, we formulate a maximum linear quadratic regulator (LQR) minimization
problem, which is subject to both the available power budget and the required
sensing beam pattern gain. To address this non-convex problem, we develop a
two-step approach by first deriving a closed-form expression of LQR as a
function of arbitrary beamformers. Subsequently, an efficient iterative
algorithm that integrates successive convex approximation (SCA) and
semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques is proposed to obtain a sub-optimal
dual-functional beamforming solution. Extensive simulation results confirm that
the 'V'-shaped formation is the most energy-efficient configuration and
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed design over benchmark schemes in
improving control performance.

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的两阶段框架结合CP-Mamba结构在近场稀疏超大MIMO系统中表现出色，稀疏阵列具有明显的性能优势。

Abstract: This paper investigates joint channel estimation and positioning in
near-field sparse extra-large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO)
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To achieve
cooperative gains between channel estimation and positioning, we propose a deep
learning-based two-stage framework comprising positioning and channel
estimation. In the positioning stage, the user's coordinates are predicted and
utilized in the channel estimation stage, thereby enhancing the accuracy of
channel estimation. Within this framework, we propose a U-shaped Mamba
architecture for channel estimation and positioning, termed as CP-Mamba. This
network integrates the strengths of the Mamba model with the structural
advantages of U-shaped convolutional networks, enabling effective capture of
local spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies of the channel.
Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage approach
with CP-Mamba architecture outperforms existing baseline methods. Moreover,
sparse arrays (SA) exhibit significantly superior performance in both channel
estimation and positioning accuracy compared to conventional compact arrays.

Result: 通过仿真揭示了端口数、QoS指数、信噪比和任务时长之间的关键权衡关系。

Conclusion: 为超可靠、低延迟和高效能的工业物联网系统设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently emerged as a promising technology
for next-generation wireless networks, offering real-time spatial
reconfiguration to enhance reliability, throughput, and energy efficiency.
Nevertheless, existing studies often overlook the temporal dynamics of channel
fading and their implications for mission-critical operations. In this paper,
we propose a dependability-theoretic framework for statistical
quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning of FAS under finite blocklength (FBL)
constraints. Specifically, we derive new closed-form expressions for the
level-crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) of an $N$-port FAS
over Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. Leveraging these second-order statistics, we
define two key dependability metrics such as mission reliability and mean
time-to-first-failure (MTTFF), to quantify the probability of uninterrupted
operation over a defined mission duration. We further extend the classical
effective capacity (EC) concept to incorporate mission reliability in the FBL
regime, yielding a mission EC (mEC). To capture energy efficiency under bursty
traffic and latency constraints, we also develop the mission effective energy
efficiency (mEEE) metric and formulate its maximization as a non-convex
fractional optimization problem. This problem is then solved via a modified
Dinkelbach's method with an embedded line search. Extensive simulations uncover
critical trade-offs among port count, QoS exponent, signal-to-noise ratio, and
mission duration, offering insights for the design of ultra-reliable,
low-latency, and energy-efficient industrial internet-of-things (IIoT) systems.

*Saeed Razavikia,Mohammad Bokaei,Arash Amini,Stefano Rini,Carlo Fischione*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于加权提升结构低秩矩阵完成的新方法，用于估计非均匀稀疏线性传感器阵列的到达方向（DOA），仅需单次快照样本，并展示了该方法在样本复杂度和性能上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对非均匀稀疏线性传感器阵列的DOA估计问题，传统方法需要多次快照样本且性能有限。本文提出一种单次快照样本的方法，旨在提高估计精度并降低计算复杂度。

Method: 方法包括四个步骤：(i) 提升天线样本形成低秩结构，(ii) 设计左右权重矩阵反映样本信息量，(iii) 通过加权提升样本完成恢复噪声自由均匀阵列输出，(iv) 从恢复的均匀线性阵列样本中获取DOA。

Result: 理论和数值评估表明，该方法在样本复杂度上接近最优，且性能优于非加权方法和基于原子范数最小化的方法，在低噪声条件下归一化均方误差显著降低约10 dB。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种高效的DOA估计方法，适用于单次快照样本场景，显著提升了性能并为稀疏阵列DOA估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for estimating the direction of arrival
(DOA) for a non-uniform and sparse linear sensor array using the weighted
lifted structure low-rank matrix completion. The proposed method uses a single
snapshot sample in which a single array of data is observed. The method is
rooted in a weighted lifted-structured low-rank matrix recovery framework. The
method involves four key steps: (i) lifting the antenna samples to form a
low-rank stature, then (ii) designing left and right weight matrices to reflect
the sample informativeness, (iii) estimating a noise-free uniform array output
through completion of the weighted lifted samples, and (iv) obtaining the DOAs
from the restored uniform linear array samples.
  We study the complexity of steps (i) to (iii) above, where we analyze the
required sample for the array interpolation of step (iii) for DOA estimation.
We demonstrate that the proposed choice of weight matrices achieves a
near-optimal sample complexity. This complexity aligns with the problem's
degree of freedom, equivalent to the number of DOAs adjusted for logarithmic
factors. Numerical evaluations show the proposed method's superiority against
the non-weighted counterpart and atomic norm minimization-based methods.
Notably, our proposed method significantly improves, with approximately a 10 dB
reduction in normalized mean-squared error over the non-weighted method at
low-noise conditions.

TL;DR: NeuroCLIP是一种新型深度学习框架，通过整合EEG和fNIRS数据，为甲基苯丙胺成瘾提供了更可靠的生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前甲基苯丙胺成瘾的评估和治疗效果（如rTMS）主要依赖主观报告或单一的神经影像模态（如EEG或fNIRS），这些方法存在局限性和不确定性。

Method: 提出NeuroCLIP框架，通过渐进式学习策略整合同时记录的EEG和fNIRS数据，生成多模态生物标志物。

Result: NeuroCLIP显著提升了甲基苯丙胺成瘾者与健康对照者的区分能力，并客观评估了rTMS治疗后神经模式的变化。

Conclusion: NeuroCLIP提供的多模态生物标志物比单一模态方法更鲁棒和可靠，有望成为成瘾神经科学研究和临床评估的有力工具。

Abstract: Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet
its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which
may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as
electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on
conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the
reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose
NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded
EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach
offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction.
Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves
discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and
healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone.
Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based
evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in
neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically,
we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by
showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores.
These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP
offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches,
providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially
improving clinical assessments.

Conclusion: InvCSINet通过INNs和信息补偿机制，有效保留了CSI完整性，为FDD大规模MIMO系统提供了高效反馈方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising solution for efficient channel state
information (CSI) feedback in frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO
systems. Conventional deep learning-based methods typically rely on a deep
autoencoder to compress the CSI, which leads to irreversible information loss
and degrades reconstruction accuracy. This paper introduces InvCSINet, an
information-preserving CSI feedback framework based on invertible neural
networks (INNs). By leveraging the bijective nature of INNs, the model ensures
information-preserving compression and reconstruction with shared model
parameters. To address practical challenges such as quantization and
channel-induced errors, we endogenously integrate an adaptive quantization
module, a differentiable bit-channel distortion module and an information
compensation module into the INN architecture. This design enables the network
to learn and compensate the information loss during CSI compression,
quantization, and noisy transmission, thereby preserving the CSI integrity
throughout the feedback process. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
of the proposed scheme, demonstrating superior CSI recovery performance and
robustness to practical impairments with a lightweight architecture.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了ISM频段中无人机遥控链路的不对称干扰问题，并通过实验测量和HARQ机制分析，评估了上行链路干扰对下行链路吞吐量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在ISM频段中可能受到其他设备（如Wi-Fi和蓝牙）的干扰，且在空中时干扰更严重。论文旨在通过实证分析了解这种不对称干扰对通信性能的影响。

Method: 通过在城市和农村地区进行测量实验，并结合多种HARQ机制（包括Type-I和Type-III等），评估上行链路干扰对下行链路吞吐量的影响。

Result: 实验显示，在170米高度时，空中干扰比地面高出16.66 dB，导致上行链路ACK/NACK丢失，进而降低下行链路吞吐量。

Conclusion: 不对称的上行链路干扰会显著影响无人机的通信性能，尤其是下行链路的吞吐量。优化HARQ机制可能有助于改善这一问题。

Abstract: Command and control of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) is often realized
through air-to-ground (A2G) remote control (RC) links that operate in ISM
bands. While wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology is commonly used for UAV RC
links, ISM-based long-term evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation (5G)
technologies have also been recently considered for the same purpose. A major
problem for UAV RC links in the ISM bands is that other types of interference
sources, such as legacy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmissions, may degrade the link
quality. Such interference problems are a higher concern for the UAV in the air
than the RC unit on the ground due to the UAV being in line-of-sight (LoS) with
a larger number of interference sources. To obtain empirical evidence of the
asymmetric interference conditions in downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), we first
conducted a measurement campaign using a helikite platform in urban and rural
areas at NC State University. The results from this measurement campaign show
that the aggregate interference can be up to 16.66 dB at higher altitudes up to
170 m, compared with the interference observed at a ground receiver. As a
result of this asymmetric UL interference, lost hybrid automatic repeat request
(HARQ) indicators (ACK/NACK) in the UL may degrade the DL throughput. To
investigate this, we study various HARQ mechanisms, including HARQ Type-I with
no combining, HARQ Type-I with chase combining, HARQ Type-III with incremental
redundancy, and burst transmission with chase combining. To evaluate the impact
of asymmetric UL interference on throughput performance, we consider three
steps of evaluation process: 1) standalone physical DL shared channel (PDSCH)
throughput evaluation with perfect ACK/NACK assumption; 2) standalone physical
UL control channel (PUCCH) decoding reliability evaluation; and 3) PDSCH DL
throughput evaluation with asymmetric UL ACK/NACK transmission.

Method: 使用多阶段混合CNN-Transformer框架，结合CNN特征提取和注意力机制，处理呼吸声音的时频图像。

Result: 模型在二元事件分类中得分0.9039，多类事件分类中得分0.8448，优于现有最佳模型3.81%和5.94%。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源有限环境下的儿科呼吸疾病诊断提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Automated analysis of lung sound auscultation is essential for monitoring
respiratory health, especially in regions facing a shortage of skilled
healthcare workers. While respiratory sound classification has been widely
studied in adults, its ap plication in pediatric populations, particularly in
children aged <6 years, remains an underexplored area. The developmental
changes in pediatric lungs considerably alter the acoustic proper ties of
respiratory sounds, necessitating specialized classification approaches
tailored to this age group. To address this, we propose a multistage hybrid
CNN-Transformer framework that combines CNN-extracted features with an
attention-based architecture to classify pediatric respiratory diseases using
scalogram images from both full recordings and individual breath events. Our
model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 in binary event classifi cation and
0.8448 in multiclass event classification by employing class-wise focal loss to
address data imbalance. At the recording level, the model attained scores of
0.720 for ternary and 0.571 for multiclass classification. These scores
outperform the previous best models by 3.81% and 5.94%, respectively. This
approach offers a promising solution for scalable pediatric respiratory disease
diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
equipped with movable-antenna (MA) arrays to strengthen security in wireless
communication systems. We propose a novel framework that jointly optimizes the
UAV trajectory and the reconfigurable beamforming of the MA array to maximize
secrecy energy efficiency, while ensuring reliable communication with
legitimate users. By exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom enabled by the
MA array, the system can form highly directional beams and deep nulls, thereby

Abstract: Distributed optical fiber vibration sensing (DVS) systems offer a promising
solution for large-scale monitoring and intrusion event recognition. However,
their practical deployment remains hindered by two major challenges:
degradation of recognition accuracy in dynamic conditions, and the
computational bottleneck of real-time processing for mass sensing data. This
paper presents a new solution to these challenges, through a FPGA-accelerated
extreme lightweight model along with a newly proposed knowledge distillation
framework. The proposed three-layer depthwise separable convolution network
contains only 4141 parameters, which is the most compact architecture in this
field to date, and achieves a maximum processing speed of 0.019 ms for each
sample covering a 12.5 m fiber length over 0.256 s. This performance
corresponds to real-time processing capabilities for sensing fibers extending
up to 168.68 km. To improve generalizability under changing environments, the
proposed cross-domain distillation framework guided by physical priors is used
here to embed frequency-domain insights into the time-domain model. This allows
for time-frequency representation learning without increasing complexity and
boosts recognition accuracy from 51.93% to 95.72% under unseen environmental
conditions. The proposed methodology provides key advancements including a
framework combining interpretable signal processing technique with deep
learning and a reference architecture for real-time processing and
edge-computing in DVS systems, and more general distributed optical fiber
sensing (DOFS) area. It mitigates the trade-off between sensing range and
real-time capability, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and
practical deployment requirements. Furthermore, this work reveals a new
direction for building more efficient, robust and explainable artificial
intelligence systems for DOFS technologies.

Abstract: Radio frequency interference (RFI) and malicious jammers are a significant

anomalies. Our results for different power levels of the RFI/jamming sources,
and the signal of interest, reveal that our detector offers high performance
without needing any pre-existing knowledge regarding the RFI or jamming signal.

Abstract: Underwater target detection using active sonar constitutes a critical
research area in marine sciences and engineering. However, traditional signal
processing methods face significant challenges in complex underwater
environments due to noise, reverberation, and interference. To address these
issues, this paper presents a deep learning-based active sonar target detection

Abstract: A subset of Human Activity Classification (HAC) systems are based on AI
algorithms that use passively collected wireless signals. This paper presents
the micro-Doppler attack targeting HAC from wireless orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. The attack is executed by inserting
artificial variations in a transmitted OFDM waveform to alter its micro-Doppler
signature when it reflects off a human target. We investigate two variants of
our scheme that manipulate the waveform at different time scales resulting in
altered receiver spectrograms. HAC accuracy with a deep convolutional neural
network (CNN) can be reduced to less than 10%.

Abstract: This study presents a nonlinear signal processing method for accurate
radar-based heartbeat interval estimation by exploiting the periodicity of
higher-order harmonics inherent in heartbeat signals. Unlike conventional
approaches that employ selective frequency filtering or track individual
harmonics, the proposed method enhances the global periodic structure of the
spectrum via nonlinear correlation processing. Specifically, smoothing and
second-derivative operations are first applied to the radar displacement signal
to suppress noise and accentuate higher-order heartbeat harmonics. Rather than
isolating specific frequency components, we compute localized autocorrelations
of the Fourier spectrum around the harmonic frequencies. The incoherent
summation of these autocorrelations yields a pseudo-spectrum in which the
fundamental heartbeat periodicity is distinctly emphasized. This nonlinear
approach mitigates the effects of respiratory harmonics and noise, enabling
robust interbeat interval estimation. Experiments with radar measurements from
five participants demonstrate that the proposed method reduces root-mean-square
error by 20% and improves the correlation coefficient by 0.20 relative to
conventional techniques.

sharing have emerged as a promising solution to improve spectral efficiency and
meet increasing wireless demand. However, this coexistence introduces
significant challenges, including inter-system interference (ISI) and the low
Earth orbit satellite (LSat) movements. To capture the actual environment for
resource management, we propose a time-varying digital twin (DT)-aided
framework for ISTNs incorporating 3D map that enables joint optimization of
bandwidth (BW) allocation, traffic steering, and resource allocation, and aims
to minimize congestion. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear

successive convex approximation (SCA) and compressed sensing approaches.
Numerical results demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance in

Conclusion: CP-AFDM是一种高效、多功能的新型波形，适合6G的高可靠性和感知需求场景。

Abstract: We present a novel multicarrier waveform, termed chirp-permuted affine
frequency division multiplexing (CP-AFDM), which introduces a unique
chirp-permutation domain on top of the chirp subcarriers of the conventional
AFDM. Rigorous analysis of the signal model and waveform properties, supported
by numerical simulations, demonstrates that the proposed CP-AFDM preserves all
core characteristics of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) -
including robustness to doubly-dispersive channels, peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR), and full delay-Doppler representation - while further enhancing
ambiguity function resolution and peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) in the Doppler
domain. These improvements establish CP-AFDM as a highly attractive candidate
for emerging sixth generation (6G) use cases demanding both reliability and
sensing-awareness. Moreover, by exploiting the vast degree of freedom in the
chirp-permutation domain, two exemplary multifunctional applications are
introduced: an index modulation (IM) technique over the permutation domain
which achieves significant spectral efficiency gains, and a physical-layer
security scheme that ensures practically perfect security through
permutation-based keying, without requiring additional transmit energy or
signaling overhead.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能高效消除干扰，适用于实际ISAC系统。

Abstract: Multistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, which use
distributed transmitters and receivers, offer enhanced spatial coverage and
sensing accuracy compared to stand-alone ISAC configurations. However, these
systems face challenges due to interference between co-existing ISAC nodes,
especially during simultaneous operation. In this paper, we analyze the impact
of this mutual interference arising from the co-existence in a multistatic ISAC
scenario, where a mono- and a bistatic ISAC system share the same spectral
resources. We first classify differenct types of interference in the power
domain. Then, we discuss how the interference can affect both sensing and
communications in terms of bit error rate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM),
and radar image under varied transmit power and RCS configurations through
simulations. Along with interfernce analysis, we propose a low-complexity
successive interference cancellation method that adaptively cancels either the
monostatic reflection or the bistatic line-of-sight signal based on a
monostatic radar image signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The
proposed framework is evaluated with both simulations and proof-of-concept
measurements using an ISAC testbed with a radar echo generator for object
emulation. The results have shown that the proposed method reduces BER and
improves EVM as well as radar image SINR across a wide range of SINR
conditions. These results demonstrate that accurate component-wise cancellation
can be achieved with low computational overhead, making the method suitable for
practical applications.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应加权置信传播（WBP）解码器，通过动态调整权重，显著提升了线性分组码的解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WBP解码器的权重是静态且固定的，限制了其在不同信道条件下的性能提升。本文旨在通过动态调整权重，优化解码性能。

Method: 提出两种自适应WBP解码器：并行WBP解码器（权重为离散值）和两阶段解码器（利用小型神经网络动态确定权重）。

Result: 实验表明，自适应WBP在不同信道应用中比静态WBP显著降低误码率（BER），并在光信道中获得0.8 dB的编码增益。

Conclusion: 自适应WBP解码器在保持解码复杂度的同时，显著提升了性能，为高效解码提供了新方向。

Abstract: Weighted belief propagation (WBP) for the decoding of linear block codes is
considered. In WBP, the Tanner graph of the code is unrolled with respect to
the iterations of the belief propagation decoder. Then, weights are assigned to
the edges of the resulting recurrent network and optimized offline using a
training dataset. The main contribution of this paper is an adaptive WBP where
the weights of the decoder are determined for each received word. Two variants
of this decoder are investigated. In the parallel WBP decoders, the weights
take values in a discrete set. A number of WBP decoders are run in parallel to
search for the best sequence of weights in real time. In the two-stage decoder,
a small neural network is used to dynamically determine the weights of the WBP
decoder for each received word. The proposed adaptive decoders demonstrate
significant improvements over the static counterparts in two applications. In
the first application, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, polar and quasi-cyclic
low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes are used over an additive white
Gaussian noise channel. The results indicate that the adaptive WBP achieves bit
error rates (BERs) up to an order of magnitude less than the BERs of the static
WBP at about the same decoding complexity, depending on the code, its rate, and
the signal-to-noise ratio. The second application is a concatenated code
designed for a long-haul nonlinear optical fiber channel where the inner code
is a QC-LDPC code and the outer code is a spatially coupled LDPC code. In this
case, the inner code is decoded using an adaptive WBP, while the outer code is
decoded using the sliding window decoder and static belief propagation. The
results show that the adaptive WBP provides a coding gain of 0.8 dB compared to
the neural normalized min-sum decoder, with about the same computational
complexity and decoding latency.

Abstract: Inter-user interference remains a critical bottleneck in wireless
communication systems, particularly in the emerging paradigm of semantic
communication (SemCom). Compared to traditional systems, inter-user
interference in SemCom severely degrades key semantic information, often
causing worse performance than Gaussian noise under the same power level. To
address this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal
Model Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality
rooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to
distinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the
need for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA. Our key innovation
lies in shuffle-based orthogonalization, where randomly permuting the positions
of JSCC feature vectors transforms inter-user interference into Gaussian-like
noise. By assigning each user a unique shuffling pattern, the interference is
treated as channel noise, enabling effective mitigation using diffusion models
(DMs). This approach not only simplifies system design by requiring a single
universal JSCC model but also enhances privacy, as shuffling patterns act as
implicit private keys. Additionally, we extend the framework to scenarios
involving semantically correlated data. By grouping users based on semantic
similarity, a cooperative beamforming strategy is introduced to exploit
redundancy in correlated data, further improving system performance. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
multi-user SemCom frameworks, achieving superior semantic fidelity, robustness
to interference, and scalability-all without requiring additional training
overhead.

Result: 仿真表明，连续动作空间方法比离散空间更具扩展性，策略能自动学习以减少切换开销，实时响应时间小于0.4毫秒。

Conclusion: 基于DRL的方法能有效管理用户切换，减少开销并保持性能。

Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user
mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the
user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff
(HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the
allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for
mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with
continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve
as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that
integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the
associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the
first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on
the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA)
observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF).
Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is
more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy
automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the
overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a
response time less than 0.4 ms.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning method that enables
decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its promise
in medical imaging, recent FL methods are often sensitive to local factors such
as optimizers and learning rates, limiting their robustness in practical
deployments. In this work, we revisit vanilla FL to clarify the impact of edge
device configurations, benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology
and blood cell classification task. We numerically show that the choice of
local optimizer and learning rate has a greater effect on performance than the
specific FL method. Moreover, we find that increasing local training epochs can
either enhance or impair convergence, depending on the FL method. These
findings indicate that appropriate edge-specific configuration is more crucial
than algorithmic complexity for achieving effective FL.

Abstract: Calibration data are necessary to formally quantify the uncertainty of the
decisions produced by an existing artificial intelligence (AI) model. To
overcome the common issue of scarce calibration data, a promising approach is
to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive
model. However, fine-tuning the label-generating predictor on the inference
task of interest, as well as estimating the residual bias of the synthetic
labels, demand additional data, potentially exacerbating the calibration data
scarcity problem. This paper introduces a novel approach that efficiently
utilizes limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and
estimate the bias of the synthetic labels. The proposed method yields
prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees for AI-generated decisions.
Experimental results on an indoor localization problem validate the
effectiveness and performance gains of our solution.

Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular
processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding
biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP
identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient
computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep

with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly
from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions
within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich
sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture
hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We
conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings
from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that
ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large
datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller
datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive
evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It
achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On
independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2%
and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as
PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and
specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced
deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse
genomic contexts.

TL;DR: 论文研究了使用Shapley值进行传感器数据系统中异常定位的方法，发现单一固定项的Shapley值计算在复杂度和错误率上优于全项计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何高效且准确地定位传感器数据系统中的异常，降低计算复杂度。

Method: 通过理论和实验验证单一固定项的Shapley值计算方法，并与全项计算对比。

Result: 单一固定项方法在独立观察情况下复杂度更低且错误率相同；依赖观察情况未证明。

Conclusion: 单一固定项Shapley值计算是独立观察情况下异常定位的有效简化方法。

Abstract: Recent publications have suggested using the Shapley value for anomaly
localization for sensor data systems. Using a reasonable mathematical anomaly
model for full control, experiments indicate that using a single fixed term in
the Shapley value calculation achieves a lower complexity anomaly localization
test, with the same probability of error, as a test using the Shapley value for
all cases tested. A proof demonstrates these conclusions must be true for all
independent observation cases. For dependent observation cases, no proof is
available.

Abstract: From hearing aids to augmented and virtual reality devices, binaural speech
enhancement algorithms have been established as state-of-the-art techniques to
improve speech intelligibility and listening comfort. In this paper, we present
an end-to-end binaural speech enhancement method using a complex recurrent
convolutional network with an encoder-decoder architecture and a complex LSTM
recurrent block placed between the encoder and decoder. A loss function that
focuses on the preservation of spatial information in addition to speech
intelligibility improvement and noise reduction is introduced. The network
estimates individual complex ratio masks for the left and right-ear channels of
a binaural hearing device in the time-frequency domain. We show that, compared
to other baseline algorithms, the proposed method significantly improves the
estimated speech intelligibility and reduces the noise while preserving the
spatial information of the binaural signals in acoustic situations with a
single target speaker and isotropic noise of various types.

Abstract: Binaural acoustic source localization is important to human listeners for
spatial awareness, communication and safety. In this paper, an end-to-end
binaural localization model for speech in noise is presented. A lightweight
convolutional recurrent network that localizes sound in the frontal azimuthal
plane for noisy reverberant binaural signals is introduced. The model
incorporates additive internal ear noise to represent the frequency-dependent
hearing threshold of a typical listener. The localization performance of the
model is compared with the steered response power algorithm, and the use of the
model as a measure of interaural cue preservation for binaural speech
enhancement methods is studied. A listening test was performed to compare the
performance of the model with human localization of speech in noisy conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在5G智能工厂中，自主配送车辆的定位模块能耗高，存在优化空间。

Abstract: Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) are increasingly used for transporting
goods in 5G network-enabled smart factories, with the compute-intensive
localization module presenting a significant opportunity for optimization. We
propose ACCESS-AV, an energy-efficient Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
localization framework that leverages existing 5G infrastructure in smart
factory environments. By opportunistically accessing the periodically broadcast
5G Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs) for localization, ACCESS-AV obviates
the need for dedicated Roadside Units (RSUs) or additional onboard sensors to
achieve energy efficiency as well as cost reduction. We implement an
Angle-of-Arrival (AoA)-based estimation method using the Multiple Signal
Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, optimized for resource-constrained ADV
platforms through an adaptive communication-computation strategy that
dynamically balances energy consumption with localization accuracy based on
environmental conditions such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and vehicle
velocity. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCESS-AV achieves an average
energy reduction of 43.09% compared to non-adaptive systems employing AoA
algorithms such as vanilla MUSIC, ESPRIT, and Root-MUSIC. It maintains sub-30
cm localization accuracy while also delivering substantial reductions in
infrastructure and operational costs, establishing its viability for
sustainable smart factory environments.

Abstract: Advancements in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology have enabled
higher sampling rates, making it feasible to adopt digital radar architectures
that directly sample the radio-frequency (RF) signal, eliminating the need for
analog downconversion. This digital approach supports greater flexibility in
waveform design and signal processing, particularly through digital modulation
schemes like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This paper
presents a digital radar system mounted on an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV),
which employs OFDM waveforms for coherent multistatic synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) imaging in the L-band. The radar setup features a primary UAV node
responsible for signal transmission and monostatic data acquisition, alongside
secondary nodes that operate in a receive-only mode. These secondary nodes
capture the radar signal reflected from the scene as well as a direct sidelink
signal. RF signals from both the radar and sidelink paths are sampled and
processed offline. To manage data storage efficiently, a trigger mechanism is
employed to record only the relevant portions of the radar signal. The system
maintains coherency in both fast-time and slow-time domains, which is essential
for multistatic SAR imaging. Because the secondary nodes are passive, the
system can be easily scaled to accommodate a larger swarm of UAVs. The paper
details the full signal processing workflow for both monostatic and multistatic
SAR image formation, including an analysis and correction of synchronization
errors that arise from the uncoupled operation of the nodes. The proposed
coherent processing method is validated through static radar measurements,
demonstrating coherency achieved by the concept. Additionally, a UAV-based
bistatic SAR experiment demonstrates the system's performance by producing
high-resolution monostatic, bistatic, and combined multistatic SAR images.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯方法的多元高斯时间序列频谱量估计方法，适用于低频数据分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在低频数据中由于观测时间长而无法通过大量周期图平均近似正态分布的问题。

Method: 采用周期图和Wishart统计量，推导了频谱密度、相干性等的封闭形式后验分布。

Result: 得到了频谱密度、相干性及交叉频谱密度矩阵的封闭形式后验分布。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于低频数据分析，如LISA Pathfinder任务数据。

Abstract: We present a Bayesian method for estimating spectral quantities in
multivariate Gaussian time series. The approach, based on periodograms and
Wishart statistics, yields closed-form expressions at any given frequency for
the marginal posterior distributions of the individual power spectral
densities, the pairwise coherence, and the multiple coherence, as well as for
the joint posterior distribution of the full cross-spectral density matrix. In
the context of noise projection - where one series is modeled as a linear
combination of filtered versions of the others, plus a background component -
the method also provides closed-form posteriors for both the susceptibilities,
i.e., the filter transfer functions, and the power spectral density of the
background. Originally developed for the analysis of the data from the European
Space Agency's LISA Pathfinder mission, the method is particularly well-suited
to very-low-frequency data, where long observation times preclude averaging
over large sets of periodograms, which would otherwise allow these to be
treated as approximately normally distributed.

*Jiawen Qi,Chang Gao,Zhaochun Ren,Qinyu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeltaLLM是一个无需训练的框架，通过利用注意力模式的时间稀疏性，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高效的大型语言模型推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型在序列长度增加时计算量呈二次增长，现有的动态注意力修剪方法主要针对GPU或TPU等高性能硬件，不适用于边缘设备。DeltaLLM旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: DeltaLLM引入了一种基于精度和内存的增量矩阵构建策略，以及一种结合局部全注意力和外部增量近似的混合注意力机制。

Result: 在BitNet和Llama模型上，DeltaLLM能够在预填充和解码阶段实现高达60%的注意力稀疏性，同时保持甚至提升任务精度。

Conclusion: DeltaLLM为边缘设备的高效部署提供了一个无需微调且与现有推断流程无缝集成的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging
due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length.
Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with
massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at
long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We
present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in
attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling
and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces
an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that
introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism
that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation
outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the
edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model
across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework
increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage
with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the
prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97
on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity
during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible
accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising
solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly
integrating with existing inference pipelines.

TL;DR: LowKeyEMG是一种基于sEMG的实时人机接口，通过7个手势类别实现高效文本输入，尤其适用于运动障碍者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统sEMG解码全字母表不可靠，尤其对运动障碍者不友好，因此设计了一种低键位输入方案以提高可靠性。

Method: 将英文字母表简化为4个手势键，另加3个键用于空格和系统交互，采用RWKV语言模型进行高效计算。

Result: 实验显示，参与者单手打字速度为23.3 WPM，手势效率提升17%，7键输入时单词准确率达98.2%。

Conclusion: 低键位输入范式在辅助技术和输入带宽受限的场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce LowKeyEMG, a real-time human-computer interface that enables
efficient text entry using only 7 gesture classes decoded from surface
electromyography (sEMG). Prior work has attempted full-alphabet decoding from
sEMG, but decoding large character sets remains unreliable, especially for
individuals with motor impairments. Instead, LowKeyEMG reduces the English
alphabet to 4 gesture keys, with 3 more for space and system interaction, to
reliably translate simple one-handed gestures into text, leveraging the
recurrent transformer-based language model RWKV for efficient computation. In
real-time experiments, participants achieved average one-handed keyboardless
typing speeds of 23.3 words per minute with LowKeyEMG, and improved gesture
efficiency by 17% (relative to typed phrase length). When typing with only 7
keys, LowKeyEMG can achieve 98.2% top-3 word accuracy, demonstrating that this
low-key typing paradigm can maintain practical communication rates. Our results
have implications for assistive technologies and any interface where input
bandwidth is constrained.
