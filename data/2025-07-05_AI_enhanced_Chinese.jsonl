In this paper,\nwe introduce a derivative-free optimization (a.k.a., zeroth-order (ZO)\noptimization) technique to directly optimize reconfigurable coefficients to\nshape the wireless end-to-end channel, without the need of channel modeling and\nestimation of the implicit environmental propagation parameters.

However, existing studies ignore the physical\nconstraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To\nfill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into\naccount the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact\nof adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average\npower consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly\noptimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit\nbeamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to\nconsider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional\ndegree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and\ndiscrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the\nfact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the\nchannel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To\ntackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for\ncontinuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a\nmixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance\nenhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and\nadjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the\nefficiency of the proposed optimization framework.

In this paper, we strive to answer this\nquestion by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical\nalgorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are\ninduced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the\npermutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed\nby two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not. We\nproceed to re-express the numerical algorithms for optimizing several\nrepresentative resource allocation problems in recursive forms.

To realize the full\npotential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver\ndesign, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and\nperformance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel\nmodel is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the\ndeterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of\nwireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading.\nNext, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML)\ndetection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is\ndesigned, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML\nperformance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER)\nis derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding\nmethod is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by\njointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the\nwaveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all\nreceived signal points.

This goal is achieved in\nfully-digital receivers by employing the matrix pencil method (MPM).\nUnfortunately, the MPM cannot be directly applied in HAD receivers because of\nthe entanglement induced by the underlying analog combiners on the output\nsignals. Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a\nlow-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from\nparticular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two\napproaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two\napproaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by\ncycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the\nentire space. The first approach can be applied to both fully-connected (FC)\nand partially-connected (PC) HADs and relies on the availability of periodic,\npotentially unknown, signals to disentangle the output of the HAD receiver. The\nsecond approach applies to PC-HADs only, and eliminates contingency on periodic\nsignals by exploiting the underlying block diagonal structure.

To address such black-box network\nmanagement tasks, the large language model (LLM) optimizer framework, which\nleverages pretrained LLMs as optimization agents, has recently been promoted as\na promising solution. This framework utilizes natural language prompts\ndescribing the given optimization problems along with past solutions generated\nby LLMs themselves. As a result, LLMs can obtain efficient solutions\nautonomously without knowing the mathematical models of the objective\nfunctions. Although the viability of the LLM optimizer (LLMO) framework has\nbeen studied in various black-box scenarios, it has so far been limited to\nnumerical simulations. For the first time, this paper establishes a theoretical\nfoundation for the LLMO framework. With careful investigations of LLM inference\nsteps, we can interpret the LLMO procedure as a finite-state Markov chain, and\nprove the convergence of the framework. Our results are extended to a more\nadvanced multiple LLM architecture, where the impact of multiple LLMs is\nrigorously verified in terms of the convergence rate.

However, its potential for\nstructural health monitoring (SHM), which requires the detection of slow and\nsubtle structural changes, remains largely unexplored due to challenges such as\nmultipath interference and the need for ultra-high sensing precision. This\nstudy introduces a novel theoretical framework for SHM via ISAC by leveraging\nreconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as reference points in collaboration\nwith base stations and users. By dynamically adjusting RIS phases to generate\ndistinct radio signals that suppress background multipath interference,\nmeasurement accuracy at these reference points is enhanced.

This work introduces a Binary\nField-Driven Meta-Routing Method supported by a semi-analytical framework that\nmodels the tunable interaction between THz plasmonic phenomena and graphene's\nelectromagnetic properties. By modulating graphene's impedance, the method\nenables dynamic coupling and routing of localized surface plasmon resonances\n(LSPRs) across a meta-network, facilitating real-time beam steering in\nchip-scale systems. Combining analytical conductivity models, coupled-mode\ntheory, and algorithmic control, the approach enables predictive configuration\nof LSPR-based steering in reconfigurable graphene metasurfaces.

Chemical potential modulation creates reconfigurable LSPR\npathways and virtual SPP channels.
