<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SPL仿真方法因其逐光子处理的顺序性而计算密集，而高光子流条件下硬件死区时间会显著扭曲光子测量结果，因此需要更高效的仿真方法。

Method: 采用基于学习的框架，通过自动编码器模型直接预测光子注册的PDF，并估算光子数量和分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法在保持高精度的同时大幅减少了仿真时间，适用于高光子流条件下的数据密集型成像任务。

Conclusion: 该学习框架能实现快速且准确的SPL仿真，具有在高光子流条件下的应用潜力。

Abstract: Efficient simulation of photon registrations in single-photon LiDAR (SPL) is
essential for applications such as depth estimation under high-flux conditions,
where hardware dead time significantly distorts photon measurements. However,
the conventional wisdom is computationally intensive due to their inherently
sequential, photon-by-photon processing. In this paper, we propose a
learning-based framework that accelerates the simulation process by modeling
the photon count and directly predicting the photon registration probability
density function (PDF) using an autoencoder (AE). Our method achieves high
accuracy in estimating both the total number of registered photons and their
temporal distribution, while substantially reducing simulation time. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach,
highlighting its potential to enable fast and accurate SPL simulations for
data-intensive imaging tasks in the high-flux regime.

### [3] [Multi-output Classification using a Cross-talk Architecture for Compound Fault Diagnosis of Motors in Partially Labeled Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24001)
*Wonjun Yi,Wonho Jung,Kangmin Jang,Yong-Hwa Park*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的多输出分类（MOC）框架，用于部分标记（PL）目标数据集的领域自适应复合故障诊断，其性能优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转机械复杂性和运行条件多样性（如转速和变扭矩）增加了领域自适应中复合故障诊断的挑战，尤其是部分标记数据集。

Method: 提出了多输出分类框架，支持复合故障严重程度的同步分类；探索了单任务和多任务架构，并引入跨层结构选择性共享信息；结合频域归一化提升领域自适应能力。

Result: 在六种领域自适应场景中，模型宏F1性能优于基线；跨层结构在复合故障场景中优势更显著；频域归一化优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 改进主要源于模型结构利用故障分类任务间交互的能力，而非单纯增加参数量。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of rotating machinery and the diversity of
operating conditions, such as rotating speed and varying torques, have
amplified the challenges in fault diagnosis in scenarios requiring domain
adaptation, particularly involving compound faults. This study addresses these
challenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework
tailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled (PL) target datasets.
Unlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the proposed
MOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously.
Furthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures
applicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based
designs-for compound fault diagnosis under PL conditions. Based on this
investigation, we propose a novel cross-talk layer structure that enables
selective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing
classification performance in compound fault scenarios. In addition,
frequency-layer normalization was incorporated to improve domain adaptation
performance on motor vibration data. Compound fault conditions were implemented
using a motor-based test setup, and the proposed model was evaluated across six
domain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior
macro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed that the
proposed mode's structural advantage is more pronounced in compound fault
settings through a single-fault comparison. We also found that frequency-layer
normalization fits the fault diagnosis task better than conventional methods.
Lastly, we discuss that this improvement primarily stems from the model's
structural ability to leverage inter-fault classification task interactions,
rather than from a simple increase in model parameters.

*Tanish Baranwal,Arnab Das,Srihari Varada,Santanu Das,Mohammad R. Haider*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合PCA和自动编码器的混合机器学习方法，用于实时检测资源受限环境中相关传感器数据流的异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着IoT系统在多个行业的广泛应用，传感器网络的重要性日益增加，但异常数据会破坏系统可靠性，且现有研究较少关注资源受限环境中的相关传感器数据流。

Method: 使用PCA持续监控传感器数据，检测到显著变化时触发自动编码器进行异常检测。

Result: 该方法在真实和模拟数据上验证，显示响应时间更快、误报更少，F1分数与自动编码器相当。

Conclusion: 混合方法通过PCA驱动显著提升了响应速度，适用于资源受限环境中的实时异常检测。

Abstract: The growing adoption of IoT systems in industries like transportation,
banking, healthcare, and smart energy has increased reliance on sensor
networks. However, anomalies in sensor readings can undermine system
reliability, making real-time anomaly detection essential. While a large body
of research addresses anomaly detection in IoT networks, few studies focus on
correlated sensor data streams, such as temperature and pressure within a
shared space, especially in resource-constrained environments. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid machine learning approach combining Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders. In this method, PCA continuously
monitors sensor data and triggers the Autoencoder when significant variations
are detected. This hybrid approach, validated with real-world and simulated
data, shows faster response times and fewer false positives. The F1 score of
the hybrid method is comparable to Autoencoder, with much faster response time
which is driven by PCA.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升系统容错能力，适用于高可靠性需求的IoT应用。

Abstract: In this article, we present a novel redundancy scheme to realize a
fault-tolerant IoT structure for application in high-reliability systems. The
proposed fault-tolerant structure uses a centralized data fusion block and
triplicated IoT devices, along with software-based "digital twins", that
duplicate the function of each of the sensors. In case of a fault in one of the
IoT devices, the pertinent digital twin takes over the function of the actual
IoT device for some time in the triplicated structure till the faulty device is
either replaced or repaired when possible. The use of software-based digital
twins as a duplicate for each physical sensor improves the reliability of the
operation with minimal increase in the overall system cost.

Abstract: The advent of 6G wireless networks promises unprecedented connectivity,
supporting ultra-high data rates, low latency, and massive device connectivity.
However, these ambitious goals introduce significant challenges, particularly
in channel estimation due to complex and dynamic propagation environments. This
paper explores the concept of channel knowledge maps (CKMs) as a solution to
these challenges. CKMs enable environment-aware communications by providing
location-specific channel information, reducing reliance on real-time pilot
measurements. We categorize CKM construction techniques into measurement-based,
model-based, and hybrid methods, and examine their key applications in
integrated sensing and communication systems, beamforming, trajectory
optimization of unmanned aerial vehicles, base station placement, and resource
allocation. Furthermore, we discuss open challenges and propose future research
directions to enhance the robustness, accuracy, and scalability of CKM-based
systems in the evolving 6G landscape.

Conclusion: 全息干涉表面为无线通信架构提供了新的可能性，所提出的方法有效解决了自干扰问题，并实现了高性能的信道估计。

Abstract: The Holographic Interference Surface (HIS) opens up a new prospect for
building a more cost-effective wireless communication architecture by
performing Radio Frequency (RF) domain signal processing. In this paper, we
establish a wideband channel sensing architecture for electromagnetic wave
reception and channel estimation based on the principle of holographic
interference theory. Dute to the nonlinear structure of holograms,
interferential fringes composed of wideband RF signals exhibit severe
self-interference effects in the time-frequency domain, which are inherently
resistant to the classical signal processing tools. To overcome the
self-interference, we propose a holographic channel recovery method, which
analyzes the time-domain variation of holograms from a geometrical perspective
and constructs an inverse mapping from wideband holograms to object waves.
Based on the Wirtinger partial derivative and Armijo condition, we then develop
a wideband hologram-based maximum likelihood (WH-ML) estimation method for
estimating the channel state information (CSI) from holograms. We also propose
a geometric rotation-based object wave sensing (GROWS) algorithm to address the
complicated computation of ML estimation. Furthermore, we derive the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for investigating the achievable performance of
wideband holographic channel estimation. Simulation results show that under the
wideband channel sensing architecture, our proposed algorithm can accurately
estimate the CSI in wideband scenarios.

Result: 算法平均收敛于13.6次迭代，路径损耗最高降低54%，且路径损耗波动小于2 dB，比单参数优化方法波动降低了45%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了三向线圈磁感应通信的覆盖性能和路径损耗表现，具备更高的实用性和稳健性。

Abstract: In this paper, we enhance the omnidirectional coverage performance of
tri-directional coil-based magnetic induction communication (TC-MIC) and reduce
the pathloss with a joint transmit and receive magnetic beamforming method. An
iterative optimization algorithm incorporating the transmit current vector and
receive weight matrix is developed to minimize the pathloss under constant
transmit power constraints. We formulate the mathematical models for the mutual
inductance of tri-directional coils, receive power, and pathloss. The
optimization problem is decomposed into Rayleigh quotient extremum optimization
for transmit currents and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality-constrained optimization
for receive weights, with an alternating iterative algorithm to approach the
global optimum. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
converges within an average of 13.6 iterations, achieving up to 54% pathloss
reduction compared with equal power allocation schemes. The joint optimization
approach exhibits superior angular robustness, maintaining pathloss fluctuation
smaller than 2 dB, and reducing fluctuation of pathloss by approximately 45%
compared with single-parameter optimization methods.

Abstract: Developing a general-purpose wearable real-time fall-detection system is
still a challenging task, especially for healthy and strong subjects, such as
industrial workers that work in harsh environments. In this work, we present a
hybrid approach for fall detection and prevention, which uses the dynamic model
of an inverted pendulum to generate simulations of falling that are then fed to
a deep learning framework. The output is a signal to activate a fall mitigation
mechanism when the subject is at risk of harm. The advantage of this approach
is that abstracted models can be used to efficiently generate training data for
thousands of different subjects with different falling initial conditions,
something that is practically impossible with real experiments. This approach
is suitable for a specific type of fall, where the subjects fall without
changing their initial configuration significantly, and it is the first step
toward a general-purpose wearable device, with the aim of reducing
fall-associated injuries in industrial environments, which can improve the
safety of workers.

Abstract: Fall-caused injuries are common in all types of work environments, including
offices. They are the main cause of absences longer than three days, especially
for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). However, data, data amount, data
heterogeneity, and stringent processing time constraints continue to pose
challenges to real-time fall detection. This work proposes a new approach based
on a recurrent neural network (RNN) for Fall Detection and a Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network (KAN) to estimate the time of impact of the fall. The approach is
tested on SisFall, a dataset consisting of 2706 Activities of Daily Living

estimated time of impact is approximately 160ms.

Using data from six healthy subjects in a manufacturing plant, this paper

Conclusion: 5G NR雷达在无人机检测中可行，但性能受环境影响显著，需进一步优化以应对复杂传播环境。

Abstract: The integration of sensing capabilities into 5G New Radio (5G NR) networks
offers an opportunity to enable the detection of airborne objects without the
need for dedicated radars. This paper investigates the feasibility of using
standardized Positioning Reference Signals (PRS) to detect UAVs in Urban Micro

processing chain is implemented, including clutter suppression, angle and range
estimation, and 3D position reconstruction. Simulation results show that
performance strongly depends on the propagation environment. 5G NR radars
exhibit the highest missed detection rate, up to 16%, in UMi, due to severe
clutter. Positioning error increases with target distance, resulting in larger
errors in UMa scenarios and at higher UAV altitudes. In particular, the system
achieves a position error within 4m in the UMi environment and within 8m in
UMa. The simulation platform has been released as open-source software to
support reproducible research in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)

Abstract: Emerging as a cornerstone for next-generation wireless networks, integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems demand innovative solutions to balance
spectral efficiency and sensing accuracy. In this paper, we propose a
coordinated beamforming framework for a reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS)-empowered ISAC system, where the active precoding at the dual-functional
base station (DFBS) and the passive beamforming at the RIS are jointly
optimized to provide communication services for legitimate unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) while sensing the unauthorized UAVs. The sum-rate of all
legitimate UAVs are maximized, while satisfying the radar sensing
signal-to-noise ratio requirements, the transmit power constraints, and the
reflection coefficients of the RIS. To address the inherent non-convexity from
coupled variables, we propose a low-complexity algorithm integrating fractional
programming with alternating optimization, featuring convergence guarantees.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher data
rate compared to disjoint optimization benchmarks. This underscores RIS's
pivotal role in harmonizing communication and target sensing functionalities
for low-altitude networks.

Result: 仿真表明该方法能有效管理干扰，保障主用户QoS并显著提高次级用户吞吐量。

Conclusion: STAR-RIS是CR-RSMA服务的高效解决方案，兼顾主次用户性能。

Abstract: Cognitive radio rate-splitting multiple access (CR-RSMA) has emerged as a
promising multiple access framework that can efficiently manage interference
and adapt dynamically to heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements.
To effectively support such demanding access schemes, programmable wireless
environments have attracted considerable attention, especially through
simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(STAR-RISs), which can enable full-space control of signal propagation in
asymmetric user deployments. In this paper, we propose the cognitive radio (CR)
functionality for STAR-RIS-assisted CR-RSMA systems, leveraging the unique
capability of the STAR-RIS to combine element and power splitting for adaptive
control of transmission and reflection in CR scenarios. Specifically, the
proposed CR functionality partitions the STAR-RIS into two regions
independently controlling the transmission and reflection of signals,
simultaneously ensuring the required QoS for the primary user and enhancing the
performance of the secondary user. To accurately characterize the system
performance, we derive analytical expressions for the ergodic rate of the
secondary user and the outage rate of the primary user under Nakagami-m fading.
Finally, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively manages
interference, guarantees the QoS of the primary user, and significantly
improves the throughput of the secondary user, highlighting STAR-RIS as an
efficient solution for CR-RSMA-based services.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks,
satellite-IoT systems using the LoRa technique have been increasingly deployed
to provide widespread Internet services to low-power and low-cost ground
devices. However, the long transmission distance and adverse environments from
IoT satellites to ground devices pose a huge challenge to link reliability, as
evidenced by the measurement results based on our real-world setup. In this
paper, we propose a blind coherent combining design named B2LoRa to boost LoRa
transmission performance. The intuition behind B2LoRa is to leverage the
repeated broadcasting mechanism inherent in satellite-IoT systems to achieve
coherent combining under the low-power and low-cost constraints, where each
re-transmission at different times is regarded as the same packet transmitted
from different antenna elements within an antenna array. Then, the problem is
translated into aligning these packets at a fine granularity despite the time,
frequency, and phase offsets between packets in the case of frequent packet
loss. To overcome this challenge, we present three designs - joint packet
sniffing, frequency shift alignment, and phase drift mitigation to deal with
ultra-low SNRs and Doppler shifts featured in satellite-IoT systems,
respectively. Finally, experiment results based on our real-world deployments
demonstrate the high efficiency of B2LoRa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究主要局限于狗叫声和低采样率音频转换，本文旨在扩展非语音声音的多样性，并提升转换质量。

Method: 采用预处理流程和改进的CVAE-based H2NH-VC模型，优化人类与非人类声音的转换。

Result: 实验显示，所提方法在质量、自然度和相似度MOS上优于基线，能有效转换多种非人类音色。

Conclusion: 改进的模型在多样非人类声音转换中表现出色，为高质量语音合成提供了新方案。

Abstract: Human to non-human voice conversion (H2NH-VC) transforms human speech into
animal or designed vocalizations. Unlike prior studies focused on dog-sounds
and 16 or 22.05kHz audio transformation, this work addresses a broader range of
non-speech sounds, including natural sounds (lion-roars, birdsongs) and
designed voice (synthetic growls). To accomodate generation of diverse
non-speech sounds and 44.1kHz high-quality audio transformation, we introduce a
preprocessing pipeline and an improved CVAE-based H2NH-VC model, both optimized
for human and non-human voices. Experimental results showed that the proposed
method outperformed baselines in quality, naturalness, and similarity MOS,
achieving effective voice conversion across diverse non-human timbres. Demo

Method: 开发了一种紧凑型迷你MagicTac传感器，集成多层三维网格结构，并嵌入软弹性体中。MagicGripper整合了这一传感器，同时具备接近感和视觉感知能力。

Conclusion: MagicGripper展现了在复杂接触环境中作为实用且多功能工具的潜力，为机器人智能操作提供了新方向。

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation in unstructured environments demands precise,
multimodal perception to enable robust and adaptive control. Vision-based
tactile sensors (VBTSs) have emerged as an effective solution; however,
conventional VBTSs often face challenges in achieving compact, multi-modal
functionality due to hardware constraints and algorithmic complexity. In this
work, we present MagicGripper, a multimodal sensor-integrated gripper designed
for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Building on our prior design, MagicTac,
we develop a compact variant, mini-MagicTac, which features a
three-dimensional, multi-layered grid embedded in a soft elastomer.
MagicGripper integrates mini-MagicTac, enabling high-resolution tactile
feedback alongside proximity and visual sensing within a compact,
gripper-compatible form factor. We conduct a thorough evaluation of
mini-MagicTac's performance, demonstrating its capabilities in spatial
resolution, contact localization, and force regression. We also assess its
robustness across manufacturing variability, mechanical deformation, and
sensing performance under real-world conditions. Furthermore, we validate the
effectiveness of MagicGripper through three representative robotic tasks: a
teleoperated assembly task, a contact-based alignment task, and an autonomous
robotic grasping task. Across these experiments, MagicGripper exhibits reliable
multimodal perception, accurate force estimation, and high adaptability to
challenging manipulation scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
MagicGripper as a practical and versatile tool for embodied intelligence in
complex, contact-rich environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了使用数字孪生体模来定量校准和比较光声图像重建算法的质量，验证了一种基于傅里叶变换的重建算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量测量方法不足，而全参考方法需要理想参考图像，但在体内或体模研究中无法获取。数字孪生体模可以缩小模拟与实际之间的差距。

Method: 利用数字孪生体模和成像系统进行定量校准，比较了多种先进重建算法，并首次在实验数据中测试了基于傅里叶变换的重建算法。

Conclusion: 数字孪生体模为光声图像重建算法的定量比较提供了有效工具，基于傅里叶变换的算法具有高效和实用的特点。数据和代码已公开发布。

Abstract: Quantitative comparison of the quality of photoacoustic image reconstruction
algorithms remains a major challenge. No-reference image quality measures are
often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal
reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown
in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom
properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical
digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a
quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of
this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare
multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a
Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection
geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results
demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of
the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image
reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show
that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those
of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and
code are publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388429.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为"


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如LASSO）在支持选择与信号估计中缺乏显式错误控制，导致信号恢复不可靠。本文旨在通过精确的假发现率（FDR）控制，改进信号恢复的可靠性。

Method: 采用Knockoff过滤器分离并控制支持恢复过程，实现FDR的有限样本控制，从而更准确地识别信号支持并重建信号。

Result: 理论证明在较弱条件下实现信号恢复，数值实验显示F1分数提升最多3.9倍，重建误差更低，并在真实数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过统计基础的FDR控制，成为现有技术的稳健替代方案，兼具理论保证和强实证性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Knockoff-guided compressive sensing framework,
referred to as \TheName{}, which enhances signal recovery by leveraging precise
false discovery rate (FDR) control during the support identification phase.
Unlike LASSO, which jointly performs support selection and signal estimation
without explicit error control, our method guarantees FDR control in finite
samples, enabling more reliable identification of the true signal support. By
separating and controlling the support recovery process through statistical
Knockoff filters, our framework achieves more accurate signal reconstruction,
especially in challenging scenarios where traditional methods fail. We
establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating how FDR control directly ensures
recovery performance under weaker conditions than traditional $\ell_1$-based
compressive sensing methods, while maintaining accurate signal reconstruction.
Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed Knockoff-based
method consistently outperforms LASSO-based and other state-of-the-art
compressive sensing techniques. In simulation studies, our method improves
F1-score by up to 3.9x over baseline methods, attributed to principled false
discovery rate (FDR) control and enhanced support recovery. The method also
consistently yields lower reconstruction and relative errors. We further
validate the framework on real-world datasets, where it achieves top downstream
predictive performance across both regression and classification tasks, often
narrowing or even surpassing the performance gap relative to uncompressed
signals. These results establish \TheName{} as a robust and practical
alternative to existing approaches, offering both theoretical guarantees and
strong empirical performance through statistically grounded support selection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效估计Tyler正则化M估计（RTME）收缩系数α的方法，通过近似留一交叉验证（LOOCV）对数似然损失函数，显著降低了计算复杂度，实验验证了其在高维数据中的高效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LOOCV方法计算复杂度高，尤其在大样本量时难以实现。为高效估计RTME的最优收缩系数α，需找到一种计算可行的替代方案。

Method: 通过提出一个计算高效的LOOCV对数似然损失近似方法，避免了每次留一验证时重复计算RTME，从而实现时间复杂度从O(n^2)降低到O(n)。

Result: 在合成和真实高维数据集（如目标识别、人脸识别和手写数字识别）上的实验表明，该方法不仅高效，且准确率高于文献中其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的近似方法显著提升了LOOCV的计算效率，同时保持了高精度，适用于高维和重尾分布数据的收缩系数估计。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a regularization parameter, or a
shrinkage coefficient $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for Regularized Tyler's M-estimator
(RTME). In particular, we propose to estimate an optimal shrinkage coefficient
by setting $\alpha$ as the solution to a suitably chosen objective function;
namely the leave-one-out cross-validated (LOOCV) log-likelihood loss. Since
LOOCV is computationally prohibitive even for moderate sample size $n$, we
propose a computationally efficient approximation for the LOOCV log-likelihood
loss that eliminates the need for invoking the RTME procedure $n$ times for
each sample left out during the LOOCV procedure. This approximation yields an
$O(n)$ reduction in the running time complexity for the LOOCV procedure, which
results in a significant speedup for computing the LOOCV estimate. We
demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic
high-dimensional data sampled from heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, as
well as on real high-dimensional datasets for object recognition, face
recognition, and handwritten digit's recognition. Our experiments show that the
proposed approach is efficient and consistently more accurate than other
methods in the literature for shrinkage coefficient estimation.

Abstract: Harnessing multi-level electron transitions, Rydberg Atomic Receivers (RAREs)
can detect wireless signals across a wide range of frequency bands, from
Megahertz to Terahertz, enabling multi-band communications and sensing (C&S).
Current research on multi-band RAREs primarily focuses on experimental
demonstrations, lacking an interpretable model to mathematically characterize
their mechanisms. This issue leaves the multi-band RARE as a black box, posing
challenges in its practical C&S applications. To fill in this gap, this paper
investigates the underlying mechanism of multi-band RAREs and explores their
optimal performance. For the first time, the closed-form expression of the
transfer function of a multi-band RARE is derived by solving the quantum
response of Rydberg atoms excited by multi-band signals. The function reveals
that a multiband RARE simultaneously serves as both a multi-band atomic mixer
for down-converting multi-band signals and a multi-band atomic amplifier that
reflects its sensitivity to each band. Further analysis of the atomic amplifier
unveils that the gain factor at each frequency band can be decoupled into a
global gain term and a Rabi attention term. The former determines the overall
sensitivity of a RARE to all frequency bands of wireless signals. The latter
influences the allocation of the overall sensitivity to each frequency band,
representing a unique attention mechanism of multi-band RAREs. The optimal
design of the global gain is provided to maximize the overall sensitivity of
multi-band RAREs. Subsequently, the optimal Rabi attentions are also derived to
maximize the practical multi-band C&S performance. Numerical results confirm
the effectiveness of the derived transfer function and the superiority of
multi-band RAREs.

Abstract: Recently, a novel flexible-antenna technology, called pinching antennas, has
attracted growing academic interest. By inserting discrete dielectric
materials, pinching antennas can be activated at arbitrary points along
waveguides, allowing for flexible customization of large-scale path loss. This
paper investigates a multi-waveguide pinching-antenna integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) system, where transmit pinching antennas (TPAs) and
receive pinching antennas (RPAs) coordinate to simultaneously detect one
potential target and serve one downlink user. We formulate a communication rate
maximization problem subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirement,
transmit power budget, and the allowable movement region of the TPAs, by
jointly optimizing TPA locations and transmit beamforming design. To address
the non-convexity of the problem, we propose a novel fine-tuning approximation
method to reformulate it into a tractable form, followed by a successive convex
approximation (SCA)-based algorithm to obtain the solution efficiently.
Extensive simulations validate both the system design and the proposed
algorithm. Results show that the proposed method achieves near-optimal
performance compared with the computational-intensive exhaustive search-based
benchmark, and pinching-antenna ISAC systems exhibit a distinct
communication-sensing trade-off compared with conventional systems.

Motivation: 解决传感器网络中各设备存储和感知能力有限、仅能访问全局稀疏向量部分测量的问题，并处理测量中的异常值。

Method: 提出两阶段分布式重建算法：先恢复全局信号的幅度，再估计每个设备的局部非零信号。

Result: 在稀疏异常支持大小和视图遮挡水平温和条件下，可实现全局信号幅度完美恢复；无噪情况下可精确重建局部信号。

Conclusion: 算法在理论和仿真中均表现有效，适用于分布式传感器网络的信号恢复。

Abstract: This work examines the multi-view compressive phase retrieval problem in a
distributed sensor network, where each sensor device, limited by storage and
sensing capabilities, can access only intensity measurements from an unknown
part of the global sparse vector. The goal is to enable each sensor to recover
its observable sparse signal when measurements are corrupted by outliers. To
achieve reliable local signal recovery with limited data access, we propose a
distributed reconstruction algorithm that enables collaboration among sensor
devices without the need to share individual raw data. The proposed scheme
employs a two-stage approach that first recovers the amplitude of the global
signal (at a central server) and subsequently estimates the observable nonzero
signal entries (at each local device). Our analytic results show that perfect
global signal amplitude recovery can be achieved under mild conditions on the
support size of sparse outliers and the view blockage level. In addition, the
exact reconstruction of locally observed signal components is shown to be
attainable in the noise-free case by solving a binary optimization problem,
subject to a mild requirement on the structure of the sensing matrix. Computer
simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme.
