### [1] [A Framework of Arithmetic-Level Variable Precision Computing for In-Memory Architecture: Case Study in MIMO Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21079)
*Kaixuan Bao,Wei Xu,Xiaohu You,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的算术级可变精度计算（AL-VPC）框架，通过优化计算精度平衡性能和复杂度，相比传统方法提升了60%的吞吐量或降低了30%的复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算复杂度是无线通信中的主要挑战，现有方法多为算法特定优化。计算精度的优化是一个尚未充分探索但对计算性能和复杂度至关重要的维度。

Method: 建立了AL-VPC框架，开发了基于随机分析的误差传播模型，并提出离线VPC和在线VPC算法来优化计算精度。

Result: 在零迫预编码案例中，与传统固定精度方法相比，提升了60%的吞吐量或降低了30%的复杂度。

Conclusion: AL-VPC框架能有效平衡计算性能与复杂度，为无线通信中的计算优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Computational complexity poses a significant challenge in wireless
communication. Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through
algorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which
directly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is
a dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the
emerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing
(VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a
distinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we
establish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing
(AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each
arithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model
exploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization
problem to strike balance between computing performance and computational
complexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to
solve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a
case study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary
between computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60%
sum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared
to the traditional fixed-length methods.

Result: 通过理论分析和仿真验证，所提出的ER-FAS混合设计显著提高了用户设备的定位精度，优于传统非可重构天线阵列。

Conclusion: ER-FAS在定位任务中具有显著优势，两种模式的设计能够高效实现定位优化，为未来的无线通信系统提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (ER-FAS) introduce
additional degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain by dynamically
steering per-antenna radiation patterns, thereby enhancing power efficiency in
wireless links. Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which
adjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM
characteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing
studies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores
its application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station
serves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability
paradigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired
beampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state
selection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set
of patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM
precoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case
we derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM
precoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and
propose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern
selection. Analytical bounds and extensive simulations show that the proposed
hybrid designs for ER-FAS substantially improve UE positioning accuracy over
traditional non-reconfigurable arrays.

### [3] [Channel Estimation and Data Detection in DS-Spread Channels: A Unified Framework, Novel Algorithms, and Waveform Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21373)
*Niladri Halder,Chandra R. Murthy*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的水下声学通信接收处理框架，比较了OFDM、OTFS、OCDM和ODSS调制波形的性能，并开发了新的变分贝叶斯信道估计算法和低复杂度符号检测算法。结果显示，在接收复杂度受限时，波形选择影响性能，但随着算法优化，差异消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下声学通信中的延迟-扩展（DS）扩展信道需要统一的处理框架，以实现对不同调制波形的公平比较，并解决信道估计和数据检测的挑战。

Method: 开发了基于变分贝叶斯的离格信道估计算法（FVB和SVB），提出了低复杂度变分软符号检测（VSSD）算法，以及数据辅助的迭代信道估计与数据检测（ICED）方案。

Result: 在未编码通信中，ODSS性能最佳，OTFS和OCDM次之，OFDM最差；而在使用VSSD算法时，OTFS、OCDM和ODSS表现相似且优于OFDM。编码通信中，所有波形性能接近。

Conclusion: 接收复杂度受限时波形选择重要，但通过优化算法可消除差异；在恶劣信道条件下，波形选择尤为关键。

Abstract: We present a unified receiver processing framework for communication over
delay-scale (DS)-spread channels that arise in underwater acoustic (UWA)
communications that addresses both channel estimation (CE) and data detection
for different modulation waveforms, namely OFDM, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS, through
a common input--output relation. Using this framework, we conduct a fair and
comprehensive comparative study of these waveforms under DS-spread UWA channels
and similar receiver complexities.
  We also develop a novel iterative variational Bayesian (VB) off-grid CE
algorithm to estimate the delay and scale parameters of the channel paths, via
two approaches: a first-order approximation scheme (FVB) and a second-order
approximation scheme (SVB). We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol
detection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios
for the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED)
scheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \emph{virtual} pilots to further
improve the CE and data detection accuracy.
  Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE
and data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in
uncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier
equalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while
OFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS
perform similarly, and they outperform OFDM. With coded communications,
interestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver
is employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is
constrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel
conditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these
differences disappear.

### [4] [Sampling Theory of Jointly Bandlimited Time-vertex Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21412)
*Hang Sheng,Hui Feng,Junhao Yu,Feng Ji,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究时间-顶点图信号（TVGS）的临界采样问题，证明其在联合时间-顶点频谱域中的采样密度或采样比下限，并提出采样与重建方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间-顶点图信号模型能够描述具有不规则结构的时变数据，但其临界采样问题尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究三类TVGS（连续时间信号、无限长序列和有限长序列）的临界采样，推导采样密度下限，并提出采样与重建方法。

Result: 证明了联合带限TVGS的采样密度下限，并通过数值和真实数据集验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 临界采样在TVGS中是可行的，且其采样密度下限与频谱支持测度相关。

Abstract: Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with
irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In
this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including
continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences
in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited
TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which
depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or
sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To
demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and
reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how
the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real
datasets.

### [5] [Subset Random Sampling and Reconstruction of Finite Time-Vertex Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21415)
*Hang Sheng,Qinji Shu,Hui Feng,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对未知频谱支持的有限时间-顶点图信号（FTVGS）的子集随机采样方案，并验证了其重建框架的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机采样方法在未知频谱支持下的FTVGS采样研究中存在不足，且实际采样通常受限于部分顶点和时间点。

Method: 提出子集随机采样方案：先随机选择行和列形成子矩阵，再在子矩阵内随机采样；结合低秩、稀疏性和平滑性先验（LSSP）构建重建框架。

Result: 理论证明了高概率重建FTVGS的充分条件，实验验证了重建的可行性和框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 子集随机采样方案和LSSP框架为未知频谱支持的FTVGS提供了实用的采样和重建解决方案。

Abstract: Finite time-vertex graph signals (FTVGS) provide an efficient representation
for capturing spatio-temporal correlations across multiple data sources on
irregular structures. Although sampling and reconstruction of FTVGS with known
spectral support have been extensively studied, the case of unknown spectral
support requires further investigation. Existing random sampling methods may
extract samples from any vertex at any time, but such strategies are not
friendly in practice, where sampling is typically limited to a subset of
vertices and moments. To address this requirement, we propose a subset random
sampling scheme for FTVGS. Specifically, we first randomly select a subset of
rows and columns to form a submatrix, followed by random sampling within that
submatrix. In theory, we provide sufficient conditions for reconstructing the
original FTVGS with high probability. Additionally, we introduce a
reconstruction framework incorporating low-rank, sparsity, and smoothness
priors (LSSP), and verify the feasibility of the reconstruction and the
effectiveness of the framework through experiments.

*Pierluigi Poggiolini,Yanchao Jiang,Yifeng Gao,Fabrizio Forghieri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为PCFM的闭式GN/EGN模型，通过多项式表达空间功率分布，提高了模型的可靠性、准确性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计和优化超宽带光传输系统需要快速且准确的物理层模型。

Method: 采用多项式表示通道的空间功率分布，通过解析积分计算推导闭式模型。

Result: 在包含拉曼放大和通道间拉曼散射的多频段场景中验证了模型的高准确性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: PCFM模型在多种场景下表现出色，相关软件已公开。

Abstract: Ultrafast and accurate physical layer models are essential for designing,
optimizing and managing ultra-wideband optical transmission systems. We present
a closed-form GN/EGN model, named Polynomial Closed-Form Model (PCFM),
improving reliability, accuracy, and generality. The key to deriving PCFM is
expressing the spatial power profile of each channel along a span as a
polynomial. Then, under reasonable approximations, the integral calculation can
be carried out analytically, for any chosen degree of the polynomial. We
present a full detailed derivation of the model. We then validate it vs. the
numerically integrated GN-model in a challenging multiband (C+L+S) scenario,
including Raman amplification and inter-channel Raman scattering. We then show
that the approach works well also in the special case of the presence of
multiple lumped loss along the fiber. Overall, the approach shows very good
accuracy and broad applicability. A software implementing the model, fully
reconfigurable to any type of system layout, is available for download under
the Creative Commons 4.0 License.

### [7] [Energy Detection over Composite $κ-μ$ Shadowed Fading Channels with Inverse Gaussian Distribution in Ultra mMTC Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21614)
*He Huang,Zeping Sui,Zilong Liu,Wei Huang,Md. Noor-A-Rahim,Haishi Wang,Zhiheng Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了在超机器类型通信(mMTC)网络中复合κ-μ阴影衰落信道上能量检测(ED)的特性，并基于逆高斯分布推导了信号噪声比(SNR)的概率密度函数(PDF)的闭式表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索在6G mMTC网络中，传播路径数量对平均检测概率的影响，与传统研究中关注的设备间平均SNR不同。

Method: 采用新颖的积分和数学变换技术，首次推导了基于截断的平均检测概率的闭式表达式。

Result: 仿真结果表明，传播路径数量对平均检测概率的影响比平均SNR更显著，这与以往专注于设备间网络的研究不同。

Conclusion: 结论指出，在6G mMTC网络设计中，应优先考虑增强发射机-接收机放置和天线对准策略，而非仅依赖提高设备间的平均SNR。

Abstract: This paper investigates the characteristics of energy detection (ED) over
composite $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading channels in ultra machine-type
communication (mMTC) networks. We have derived the closed-form expressions of
the probability density function (PDF) of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on
the Inverse Gaussian (\emph{IG}) distribution. By adopting novel integration
and mathematical transformation techniques, we derive a truncation-based
closed-form expression for the average detection probability for the first
time. It can be observed from our simulations that the number of propagation
paths has a more pronounced effect on average detection probability compared to
average SNR, which is in contrast to earlier studies that focus on
device-to-device networks. It suggests that for 6G mMTC network design, we
should consider enhancing transmitter-receiver placement and antenna alignment
strategies, rather than relying solely on increasing the device-to-device
average SNR.

### [8] [On the Deployment of Multiple Radio Stripes for Large-Scale Near-Field RF Wireless Power Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21640)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了无线电条纹系统在室内近场无线充电场景中的部署，针对高能量需求区域（热点）提出了联合聚类和部署优化方法，并对比了四种部署算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决室内无线充电系统中高效能量传输的部署问题，特别是在用户密集或能量需求集中的热点区域。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段方法：1) 基于空间位置和近场传播特性的热点聚类；2) 天线元件放置优化，包括四种部署算法（SCA、SGP、直线形和正多边形）。

Result: 数值结果表明，聚类方法有效收敛，优化部署在多种频率和天线长度下优于基准，多边形部署性能最佳，直线形部署在高增益设置下表现优越。

Conclusion: 研究表明，优化部署策略可显著提升无线充电效率，多边形和直线形部署各有优势，适用于不同场景。

Abstract: This paper investigates the deployment of radio stripe systems for indoor
radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) in line-of-sight near-field
scenarios. The focus is on environments where energy demand is concentrated in
specific areas, referred to as 'hotspots', spatial zones with higher user
density or consistent energy requirements. We formulate a joint clustering and
radio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received
power across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem
into two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on
their spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii)
antenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio
stripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex
approximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are
shape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either
straight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical
results show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with
Chebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The
optimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide
range of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped
deployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches. Meanwhile,
the line-shaped deployment demonstrates an advantage under high boresight gain
settings, benefiting from increased spatial diversity and broader angular
coverage.

### [9] [Machine Intelligence on the Edge: Interpretable Cardiac Pattern Localisation Using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21652)
*Haozhe Tian,Qiyu Rao,Nina Moutonnet,Pietro Ferraro,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的顺序匹配滤波器（SMF），以解决传统匹配滤波器在低信噪比信号中效果下降的问题，展示了其在心电图R峰检测和生理状态分类中的优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统匹配滤波器在低信噪比（如耳心电图）信号中表现不佳，主要因噪声与目标信号相似。

Method: 通过强化学习设计顺序滤波器（SMF），将滤波器设计视为序列决策过程，生成信号特定的可解释滤波器序列。

Result: SMF在两个真实心电图数据集中实现了R峰检测和分类的最先进性能。

Conclusion: SMF不仅为临床决策提供了可靠且可解释的工具，还可扩展到其他噪声信号模式定位应用。

Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high
efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge
devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within
the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram
(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by
artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a
paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence
of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter
design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design
signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing
key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong
potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as
demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state
classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The
proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that
require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.

Result: 提出的框架在分类运动中表现优异，准确率达到99.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架在MI-BCI系统中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are systems that
detect and interpret brain activity patterns linked to the mental visualization
of movement, and then translate these into instructions for controlling
external robotic or domotic devices. Such devices have the potential to be
useful in a broad variety of applications. While implementing a system that
would help individuals restore some freedom levels, the interpretation of
(Electroencephalography) EEG data remains a complex and unsolved problem. In
the literature, the classification of left and right imagined movements has
been extensively studied. This study introduces a novel pipeline that makes use
of machine learning techniques for classifying MI EEG data. The entire
framework is capable of accurately categorizing left and imagined motions, as
well as rest phases, for a set of 52 subjects who performed a MI task. We
trained a within subject model on each individual subject. The methodology has
been offline evaluated and compared to four studies that are currently the
state-of-the-art regarding the specified dataset. The results show that our
proposed framework could be used with MI-BCI systems in light of its failsafe
classification performances, i.e. 99.5% in accuracy

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for
developing advanced embodied foundation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目VIO中身体坐标系速度和重力方向的同时估计问题，利用光流测量与IMU数据的融合提高精度。

Method: 使用全局指数稳定的Riccati观测器融合光流速度方向与IMU数据；在SO(3)上设计互补观测器估计姿态；开发梯度下降算法从稀疏光流数据中提取速度方向。

Result: 级联观测器架构几乎全局渐近稳定，仿真验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够有效估计速度与重力方向，为单目VIO提供了一种稳定且可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel cascaded observer architecture that combines
optical flow and IMU measurements to perform continuous monocular
visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed solution estimates body-frame
velocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction
information from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data.
This fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer,
which operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The
estimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an
optional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on
$\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation. The resulting interconnected observer
architecture is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable. To extract
the velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent
algorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit
sphere. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through
simulation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人在共同空间导航时路径重叠导致的死锁问题。

Result: 在最优情况下计算复杂度为O(K²log K)，最坏情况下为O(K³log K)。

Conclusion: 该方法有效避免了路径重叠，且能灵活应对动态环境和机器人动态。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons show promise to assist human movement, but their
utility is limited by controllers designed for discrete, predefined actions in
controlled environments, restricting their real-world applicability. We present
an uncertainty-aware control framework that enables ankle exoskeletons to
operate safely across diverse scenarios by automatically disengaging when
encountering unfamiliar movements. Our approach uses an uncertainty estimator
to classify movements as similar (in-distribution) or different
(out-of-distribution) relative to actions in the training set. We evaluated
three architectures (model ensembles, autoencoders, and generative adversarial
networks) on an offline dataset and tested the strongest performing
architecture (ensemble of gait phase estimators) online. The online test

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器的有效性，展示了其与随机克隆方法在状态和协方差更新上的等效性，同时提供了计算和内存优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人学和导航中延迟状态测量相关问题，比较延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器与随机克隆方法的性能。

Method: 采用广义卡尔曼滤波器公式，避免状态向量增广，直接处理延迟状态测量。

Result: 延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器在状态和协方差更新上与随机克隆方法完全一致，且具有更高的计算效率和更低的内存需求。

Conclusion: 延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器是处理相关延迟状态测量的高效替代方案，纠正了卡尔曼滤波器变体无法处理此类测量的误解。

Abstract: Many estimation problems in robotics and navigation involve measurements that
depend on prior states. A prominent example is odometry, which measures the
relative change between states over time. Accurately handling these
delayed-state measurements requires capturing their correlations with prior
state estimates, and a widely used approach is stochastic cloning (SC), which
augments the state vector to account for these correlations.
  This work revisits a long-established but often overlooked alternative--the
delayed-state Kalman filter--and demonstrates that a properly derived filter
yields exactly the same state and covariance update as SC, without requiring
state augmentation. Moreover, the generalized Kalman filter formulation
provides computational advantages, while also reducing memory requirements for
higher-dimensional states.
  Our findings clarify a common misconception that Kalman filter variants are
inherently unable to handle correlated delayed-state measurements,
demonstrating that an alternative formulation achieves the same results more
efficiently.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive application of legal-action
masked Deep Q-Networks with safe ZYZ regrasp strategies to an underactuated
gripper-equipped 6-DOF collaborative robot for autonomous Soma cube assembly

constraint-aware reinforcement learning with singularity-safe motion planning
on a Doosan M0609 collaborative robot. We address critical challenges in
robotic manipulation: combinatorial action space explosion, unsafe motion
planning, and systematic assembly strategy learning. Our system integrates a
legal-action masked DQN with hierarchical architecture that decomposes
Q-function estimation into orientation and position components, reducing
computational complexity from $O(3,132)$ to $O(116) + O(27)$ while maintaining
solution completeness. The robot-friendly reward function encourages
ground-first, vertically accessible assembly sequences aligned with

Conclusion: 算法在实际应用中性能接近最优分配，具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of assigning heterogeneous sensors (i.e.,
robots with varying sensing capabilities) for multi-target tracking. We
classify robots into two categories: (1) sufficient sensing robots, equipped
with range and bearing sensors, capable of independently tracking targets, and
(2) limited sensing robots, which are equipped with only range or bearing
sensors and need to at least form a pair to collaboratively track a target. Our
objective is to optimize tracking quality by minimizing uncertainty in target
state estimation through efficient robot-to-target assignment. By leveraging
matroid theory, we propose a greedy assignment algorithm that dynamically
allocates robots to targets to maximize tracking quality. The algorithm
guarantees constant-factor approximation bounds of 1/3 for arbitrary tracking
quality functions and 1/2 for submodular functions, while maintaining
polynomial-time complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness in accurately estimating and tracking targets over extended
periods. Furthermore, numerical results confirm that the algorithm's
performance is close to that of the optimal assignment, highlighting its
robustness and practical applicability.

Motivation: 解决在动态不确定环境中，如何同时保证安全性和实时性是车辆协同协调的核心挑战。

Abstract: Achieving both safety guarantees and real-time performance in cooperative
vehicle coordination remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in dynamic
and uncertain environments. This paper presents a novel coordination framework
that resolves this challenge through three key innovations: 1) direct control
of vehicles' trajectory distributions during coordination, formulated as a
robust cooperative planning problem with adaptive enhanced safety constraints,
ensuring a specified level of safety regarding the uncertainty of the
interactive trajectory, 2) a fully parallel ADMM-based distributed trajectory
negotiation (ADMM-DTN) algorithm that efficiently solves the optimization
problem while allowing configurable negotiation rounds to balance solution
quality and computational resources, and 3) an interactive attention mechanism
that selectively focuses on critical interactive participants to further
enhance computational efficiency. Both simulation results and practical
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant advantages in
safety (reducing collision rates by up to 40.79\% in various scenarios) and
real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining
strong scalability with increasing vehicle numbers. The proposed interactive
attention mechanism further reduces the computational demand by 14.1\%. The
framework's effectiveness is further validated through real-world experiments
with unexpected dynamic obstacles, demonstrating robust coordination in complex
environments. The experiment demo could be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在复杂环境中需要高效的运动规划和决策方法，以避免障碍物并保持车辆稳定性。传统的控制算法可能无法充分探索多样化的轨迹，导致次优解。

Method: 使用多模态模型预测路径积分控制算法，通过Sobol序列采样和碰撞避免分析，结合非线性单轨车辆模型和轮胎力约束，优化转向角和纵向加速度以生成无碰撞轨迹。

Result: 在高保真仿真环境中，算法成功实现了双车道变换等高难度避障任务，在不同摩擦路面和移动障碍物场景中表现优于传统模型预测路径积分方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的多模态控制算法显著提升了自动驾驶车辆在复杂环境中的避障能力和稳定性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to motion planning and decision-making
for automated vehicles, using a multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral
control algorithm. The method samples with Sobol sequences around the prior
input and incorporates analytical solutions for collision avoidance. By
leveraging multiple modes, the multi-modal control algorithm explores diverse
trajectories, such as manoeuvring around obstacles or stopping safely before
them, mitigating the risk of sub-optimal solutions. A non-linear single-track
vehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force
constraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability
during evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal
acceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to
control the vehicle. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the
vehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre on high and
low-friction road surfaces and occlusion scenarios with moving obstacles,
outperforming a standard Model Predictive Path Integral approach.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的轨迹生成方法，突破了传统机械臂负载限制的保守估计，显著扩大了工作空间的可达区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机械臂的负载评级基于最坏情况配置，导致工作空间利用率低。论文旨在通过更精确的负载动态考虑，提升机械臂的实际能力。

Method: 采用去噪扩散模型生成轨迹，将负载约束直接纳入规划过程，避免了传统方法的低效或高复杂度问题。

Result: 实验证明，7自由度机械臂在3倍标称负载下，仍可访问67.6%的工作空间。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在运动规划中更细致地考虑负载动态的重要性，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from
worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the
entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's
inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely
handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their
workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque
limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a
novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that
explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike
traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error,
optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners
that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically
feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly
executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation
on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the
workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal
capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a
more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在推理和代码生成方面表现优异，但在生成可靠的机器人操纵策略代码时仍面临挑战，主要由于任务的多样性和用户指令的复杂性。

Method: 设计RoboInspector管道，从任务复杂性和指令粒度两方面分析策略代码的不可靠性，并通过失败反馈指导的改进方法来提高可靠性。

Result: 实验发现四种导致操纵失败的不可靠行为，并通过改进方法将策略代码生成的可靠性提高了35%。

Conclusion: RoboInspector为实践开发提供了减少不可靠性的见解，改进方法在实际环境中显示出显著效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

Result: 提供了一种评估方法及指标，可区分合作与非合作人类，并展示了如何通过几何推理生成响应。

Conclusion: 通过有效沟通和几何分析，能显著改善机器人在突发情况下的导航表现。

Abstract: Socially aware robot navigation is a planning paradigm where the robot
navigates in human environments and tries to adhere to social constraints while
interacting with the humans in the scene. These navigation strategies were
further improved using human prediction models, where the robot takes the
potential future trajectory of humans while computing its own. Though these
strategies significantly improve the robot's behavior, it faces difficulties
from time to time when the human behaves in an unexpected manner. This happens
as the robot fails to understand human intentions and cooperativeness, and the
human does not have a clear idea of what the robot is planning to do. In this
paper, we aim to address this gap through effective communication at an
appropriate time based on a geometric analysis of the context and human
cooperativeness in head-on crossing scenarios. We provide an assessment
methodology and propose some evaluation metrics that could distinguish a
cooperative human from a non-cooperative one. Further, we also show how
geometric reasoning can be used to generate appropriate verbal responses or
robot actions.

Abstract: Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors
with minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on
short-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve
long-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution
shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns
continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill
demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph,
discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains
low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level
oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal
observation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables
capturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal
relations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to
discover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six
domains that involve four robotic arms, Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers
of Hanoi environments, and a distinct Automated Forklift domain with two
environments. The results demonstrate high data efficiency with as few as five
skill demonstrations, strong zero- and few-shot generalizations, and
interpretable decision making.

Conclusion: MIT*显著提升了路径规划的效率和成功率，适用于高维空间和复杂场景。

Abstract: Path planning in robotics often involves solving continuously valued,
high-dimensional problems. Popular informed approaches include graph-based
searches, such as A*, and sampling-based methods, such as Informed RRT*, which
utilize informed set and anytime strategies to expedite path optimization
incrementally. Informed sampling-based planners define informed sets as subsets
of the problem domain based on the current best solution cost. However, when no
solution is found, these planners re-sample and explore the entire
configuration space, which is time-consuming and computationally expensive.
This article introduces Multi-Informed Trees (MIT*), a novel planner that
constructs estimated informed sets based on prior admissible solution costs
before finding the initial solution, thereby accelerating the initial
convergence rate. Moreover, MIT* employs an adaptive sampler that dynamically
adjusts the sampling strategy based on the exploration process. Furthermore,
MIT* utilizes length-related adaptive sparse collision checks to guide lazy
reverse search. These features enhance path cost efficiency and computation
times while ensuring high success rates in confined scenarios. Through a series
of simulations and real-world experiments, it is confirmed that MIT*
outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners for problems in R^4
to R^16 and has been successfully applied to real-world robot manipulation
tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at:

Abstract: Traversing narrow gates presents a significant challenge and has become a
standard benchmark for evaluating agile and precise quadrotor flight.
Traditional modularized autonomous flight stacks require extensive design and
parameter tuning, while end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) methods often
suffer from low sample efficiency and limited interpretability. In this work,
we present a novel hybrid framework that adaptively fine-tunes model predictive
control (MPC) parameters online using outputs from a neural network (NN)
trained offline. The NN jointly predicts a reference pose and cost-function
weights, conditioned on the coordinates of the gate corners and the current
drone state. To achieve efficient training, we derive analytical policy
gradients not only for the MPC module but also for an optimization-based gate
traversal detection module. Furthermore, we introduce a new formulation of the
attitude tracking error that admits a simplified representation, facilitating
effective learning with bounded gradients. Hardware experiments demonstrate
that our method enables fast and accurate quadrotor traversal through narrow
gates in confined environments. It achieves several orders of magnitude
improvement in sample efficiency compared to naive end-to-end RL approaches.

Abstract: Industrial manipulators are normally operated in cluttered environments,
making safe motion planning important. Furthermore, the presence of
model-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in
practice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances.
There is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be
executed fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive
control (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a
robust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free
motion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making
our method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a
simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered
environments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark
methods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model
uncertainties, while also yielding faster motion.

Result: 基础RL代理成功学习了互动方式，而风险规避型RL代理能通过动作有效传达意图，显著降低行人感知的风险。

Conclusion: 该方法具有潜力，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Pedestrians approaching each other on a sidewalk sometimes end up in an
awkward interaction known as the "sidewalk salsa": they both (repeatedly)
deviate to the same side to avoid a collision. This provides an interesting use
case to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in
the vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation
based on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how
pedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into
the implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and
acceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,
a model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction
(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,
it is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and
decision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used
framework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept
for an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model
to learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL
agent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a
risk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model
learned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and
thereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the
modelled pedestrian. These results show this is a promising approach and
encourage further exploration.

*Ramkumar Natarajan,Muhammad Suhail Saleem,William Xiao,Sandip Aine,Howie Choset,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*)算法，称为A-MHA*，使其具备随时（anytime）求解能力，能够在有限时间内快速找到可行解并持续优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始MHA*算法虽能利用多个启发式函数加速搜索，但其一次性求解特性无法持续优化解，且需要手动调整膨胀因子。为此，研究团队希望通过扩展MHA*实现随时求解能力。

Method: 作者将Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*)的思想引入MHA*框架，开发了A-MHA*算法。该方法保留了MHA*的次优和完备性保证，并实现了随时求解特性。

Result: A-MHA*在3D路径规划和滑块拼图（sliding tiles puzzle）中表现优于原MHA*和其他随时算法。

Conclusion: A-MHA*成功地将ARA*的随时优化能力融入MHA*框架，提升了算法的实用性和解的质量。

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

### [31] [Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800)
*Hyeonseong Jeon,Cheolhong Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP)，一种零样本测试时间规划框架，通过结构化轨迹生成平衡探索与利用，解决了梯度引导在非凸、不可微分和多奖励场景下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的梯度引导方法在非凸、不可微分和多奖励结构的真实场景中效果有限，而现有的监督规划方法需要任务特定训练或价值估计器，限制了测试时的灵活性和零样本泛化能力。

Method: TDP通过双层采样过程将测试时间规划视为树搜索问题：首先生成多样化的父轨迹以鼓励探索，然后通过快速条件去噪细化子轨迹。

Result: TDP在迷宫黄金拾取、机器人手臂块操作和AntMaze多目标探索三个任务上均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过利用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号，在不依赖任务特定训练的情况下显著提升了规划性能。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

### [32] [Can Layer-wise SSL Features Improve Zero-Shot ASR Performance for Children's Speech?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21225)
*Abhijit Sinha,Hemant Kumar Kathania,Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 研究了自监督学习（SSL）预训练模型的层级特征对儿童语音识别（ASR）的零样本性能提升作用，发现Wav2Vec2模型的第22层在WSJCAM0数据集上的词错误率最低（5.15%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语音因其独特的声学和语言特性，现有ASR系统难以准确识别，SSL模型的改进潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 提取了Wav2Vec2、HuBERT等SSL模型的层级特征，通过简化DNN-Kaldi系统测试其在儿童语音零样本场景的性能。

Result: Wav2Vec2的第22层显著降低了词错误率（相对提升51.64%），且在多个年龄组和数据集（CMU Kids）上表现一致。

Conclusion: SSL模型的特定层级特征能有效提升儿童语音识别的零样本性能，尤其在年龄较大的组别中效果更佳。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately
process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and
linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech,
accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This
study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from
state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT,
Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech
in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these
models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system
using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for
enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where
WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for
testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model
achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64%
relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of
10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent
performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains
observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments
on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the
generalizability of the proposed approach.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自监督学习的零样本关键词识别方法，针对儿童语音的独特声学和语言特征取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语音的关键词识别面临独特挑战，现有方法多针对成人语音设计。本文旨在利用自监督学习模型提升儿童语音的零样本关键词识别性能。

Method: 利用Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和Data2Vec等自监督学习模型逐层提取特征，结合Kaldi框架的DNN进行训练，并在成人数据集（WSJCAM0）上训练后直接在儿童数据集（PFSTAR）上测试。

Result: Wav2Vec2模型（尤其是第22层）表现最佳，ATWV和MTWV分数分别为0.691和0.7003，误报率和漏检率较低。此外，系统在噪声环境下也优于传统MFCC方法。

Conclusion: 自监督学习特征显著提升了儿童语音的零样本关键词识别性能，证明了其在处理儿童语音独特特征方面的有效性。

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in
adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems
due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper
introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art
self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec.
Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a
Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for
training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing,
demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved
state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech.
Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best,
delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of
false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a
set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed
the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess
the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted
using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The
results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based
baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions.
To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an
additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant
contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for
children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the
distinct characteristics of child speakers.

dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop

TL;DR: GENNAV是一种用于从自然语言指令和移动设备拍摄的前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域位置的新方法，特别针对模糊边界的stuff-type目标区域提出改进，并在新基准测试和实际环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域时表现不佳，尤其是当目标不存在或多个目标时，因此需要一种更有效的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: GENNAV结合目标存在性预测和分割掩码生成技术，适用于多目标模糊边界情况，并在GRiN-Drive基准上进行评测。

Result: GENNAV在基准测试和真实驾驶实验中均优于基线方法，展示了其强大的适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV在处理模糊边界和多目标问题方面表现出色，并能在不同环境中实现零样本迁移性能。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种潜在扩散模型，从单张图像重建完整的3D高斯飞溅场景，包括遮挡部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯飞溅技术通常需要密集观测，无法重建遮挡和未观测区域。传统方法存在模糊、不真实且无法捕捉多种可能性。

Method: 使用变分自重建器在自监督学习中学习潜在空间，并在其上训练扩散模型，生成多样化的3D重建。

Result: 方法能够生成高质量360度渲染，完成遮挡表面，并提供多样化解。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式建模解决了传统回归方法的局限性，实现了从单张图像的高质量3D场景重建。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Motivation: 解决图中边流信号的稀疏表示问题，通过提升图为细胞复形，提供更稀疏和可解释的边流表示。由于问题已被证明是NP难，需要高效启发式方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为边流信号的稀疏表示提供了高效且可解释的解决方案，适用于复杂网络分析。

Abstract: We consider the following inference problem: Given a set of edge-flow signals
observed on a graph, lift the graph to a cell complex, such that the observed
edge-flow signals can be represented as a sparse combination of gradient and
curl flows on the cell complex. Specifically, we aim to augment the observed
graph by a set of 2-cells (polygons encircled by closed, non-intersecting
paths), such that the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian of the associated
cell complex provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed
edge flows on the graph. As it has been shown that the general problem is
NP-hard in prior work, we here develop a novel matrix-factorization-based
heuristic to solve the problem. Using computational experiments, we demonstrate
that our new approach is significantly less computationally expensive than
prior heuristics, while achieving only marginally worse performance in most
settings. In fact, we find that for specifically noisy settings, our new
approach outperforms the previous state of the art in both solution quality and
computational speed.

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The high mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables them to be used
in various civilian fields, such as rescue and cargo transport. Path-following
is a crucial way to perform these tasks while sensing and collision avoidance
are essential for safe flight. In this paper, we investigate how to efficiently
and accurately achieve path-following, obstacle sensing and avoidance subtasks,
as well as their conflict-free fusion scheduling. Firstly, a high precision
deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV formation path-following model is
developed, and the reward function with adaptive weights is designed from the
perspective of distance and velocity errors. Then, we use integrated sensing
and communication (ISAC) signals to detect the obstacle and derive the
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for obstacle sensing by information-level fusion,
based on which we propose the variable formation enhanced obstacle position
estimation (VFEO) algorithm. In addition, an online obstacle avoidance scheme
without pretraining is designed to solve the sparse reward. Finally, with the
aid of null space based (NSB) behavioral method, we present a hierarchical
subtasks fusion strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of the subtask algorithms and the hierarchical fusion strategy.
