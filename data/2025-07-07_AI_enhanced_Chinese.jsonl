However, existing studies ignore the physical\nconstraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To\nfill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into\naccount the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact\nof adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average\npower consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly\noptimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit\nbeamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to\nconsider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional\ndegree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and\ndiscrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the\nfact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the\nchannel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To\ntackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for\ncontinuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a\nmixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance\nenhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and\nadjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the\nefficiency of the proposed optimization framework.

To reap the benefits of both architectures,\nthere is a recent trend of incorporating attention mechanism with GNNs for\nlearning wireless policies.

In this paper, we strive to answer this\nquestion by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical\nalgorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are\ninduced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the\npermutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed\nby two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not. We\nproceed to re-express the numerical algorithms for optimizing several\nrepresentative resource allocation problems in recursive forms.

First, a comprehensive channel\nmodel is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the\ndeterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of\nwireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading.\nNext, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML)\ndetection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is\ndesigned, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML\nperformance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER)\nis derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding\nmethod is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by\njointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the\nwaveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all\nreceived signal points.

However, the inherent coupling between\nanalog and digital precoders in hybrid array architecture significantly limits\nthe computational and spectral efficiency of existing algorithms. To address\nthis issue, we propose an alternating residual error elimination (AREE)\nalgorithm, which decomposes the hybrid beamforming problem into two\nlow-dimensional subproblems, each exhibiting a favorable matrix structure that\nenables effective decoupling of analog and digital precoders from the matrix\nproduct formulation. These subproblems iteratively eliminate each other's\nresidual errors, driving the original problem toward the optimal hybrid\nbeamforming performance. The proposed initialization ensures rapid convergence,\nwhile a low-complexity geometric channel SVD algorithm is developed by\ntransforming the high-dimensional sparse channel into a low-dimensional\nequivalent, thereby simplifying the derivation of subproblems.

This goal is achieved in\nfully-digital receivers by employing the matrix pencil method (MPM).\nUnfortunately, the MPM cannot be directly applied in HAD receivers because of\nthe entanglement induced by the underlying analog combiners on the output\nsignals. Furthermore, these analog combiners project the received signal onto a\nlow-dimensional space, jeopardizing the reception of signals arriving from\nparticular DoA ranges. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose two\napproaches to enable the MPM to extract the DoAs in HAD receivers. The two\napproaches avoid severe attenuation induced by low-dimensional projection by\ncycling over an exhaustive set of analog combiners, collectively spanning the\nentire space. The first approach can be applied to both fully-connected (FC)\nand partially-connected (PC) HADs and relies on the availability of periodic,\npotentially unknown, signals to disentangle the output of the HAD receiver. The\nsecond approach applies to PC-HADs only, and eliminates contingency on periodic\nsignals by exploiting the underlying block diagonal structure.
