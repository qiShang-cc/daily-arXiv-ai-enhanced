We argue that high-level reasoning about where and what can be offloaded\nto vision-language models (VLMs), leaving policies to specialize in how to act.\nWe present PEEK (Policy-agnostic Extraction of Essential Keypoints), which\nfine-tunes VLMs to predict a unified point-based intermediate representation:\n1. end-effector paths specifying what actions to take, and 2. task-relevant\nmasks indicating where to focus.

To enable scalable training, we introduce an automatic\nannotation pipeline, generating labeled data across 20+ robot datasets spanning\n9 embodiments.

These policies provide\na strong prior over how robots should behave -- e.g., how a robot arm should\nmanipulate food items. But in order for robots to match an individual person's\nneeds, users typically fine-tune these generalized policies -- e.g., showing\nthe robot arm how to make their own preferred dinners. Importantly, during the\nprocess of personalizing robots, end-users leak data about their preferences,\nhabits, and styles (e.g., the foods they prefer to eat). Other agents can\nsimply roll-out the fine-tuned policy and see these personally-trained\nbehaviors. This leads to a fundamental challenge: how can we develop robots\nthat personalize actions while keeping learning private from external agents?\nWe here explore this emerging topic in human-robot interaction and develop\nPRoP, a model-agnostic framework for personalized and private robot policies.\nOur core idea is to equip each user with a unique key; this key is then used to\nmathematically transform the weights of the robot's network. With the correct\nkey, the robot's policy switches to match that user's preferences -- but with\nincorrect keys, the robot reverts to its baseline behaviors. We show the\ngeneral applicability of our method across multiple model types in imitation\nlearning, reinforcement learning, and classification tasks. PRoP is practically\nadvantageous because it retains the architecture and behaviors of the original\npolicy, and experimentally outperforms existing encoder-based approaches.

The study was performed in a simulation environment created in NVIDIA\nIsaac Sim, and the setup included Franka Emika Panda robotic arm holding a\nglass with a liquid that needed to be poured into a container. The\nreinforcement learning algorithm was based on Proximal Policy Optimization. We\nsystematically explored how different configurations of mutated weights in the\nrewards function would affect the learned policy. The resulting policies\nexhibit a wide range of behaviours: from variations in execution of the\noriginally intended pouring task to novel skills useful for unexpected tasks,\nsuch as container rim cleaning, liquid mixing, and watering.

While simulated data offers a\nscalable alternative, particularly with advances in automated demonstration\ngeneration, transferring policies to the real world is hampered by various\nsimulation and real domain gaps. In this work, we propose a unified\nsim-and-real co-training framework for learning generalizable manipulation\npolicies that primarily leverages simulation and only requires a few real-world\ndemonstrations. Central to our approach is learning a domain-invariant,\ntask-relevant feature space. Our key insight is that aligning the joint\ndistributions of observations and their corresponding actions across domains\nprovides a richer signal than aligning observations (marginals) alone. We\nachieve this by embedding an Optimal Transport (OT)-inspired loss within the\nco-training framework, and extend this to an Unbalanced OT framework to handle\nthe imbalance between abundant simulation data and limited real-world examples.\nWe validate our method on challenging manipulation tasks, showing it can\nleverage abundant simulation data to achieve up to a 30% improvement in the\nreal-world success rate and even generalize to scenarios seen only in\nsimulation."}

As a result, cloud-native techniques, such as microservices\nand container orchestration, play an increasingly important role in their\noperation. However, orchestrating applications in a large-scale C-ITS poses\nunique challenges due to the dynamic nature of the environment and the need for\nefficient resource utilization. In this paper, we present a demand-driven\napplication management approach that leverages cloud-native techniques -\nspecifically Kubernetes - to address these challenges. Taking into account the\ndemands originating from different entities within the C-ITS, the approach\nenables the automation of processes, such as deployment, reconfiguration,\nupdate, upgrade, and scaling of microservices. Executing these processes on\ndemand can, for example, reduce computing resource consumption and network\ntraffic. A demand may include a request for provisioning an external supporting\nservice, such as a collective environment model. The approach handles changing\nand new demands by dynamically reconciling them through our proposed\napplication management framework built on Kubernetes and the Robot Operating\nSystem (ROS 2). We demonstrate the operation of our framework in the C-ITS use\ncase of collective environment perception and make the source code of the\nprototypical framework publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/application_manager ."}

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions.
