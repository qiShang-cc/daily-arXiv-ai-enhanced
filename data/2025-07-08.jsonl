While Transformer-based models utilizing channel-independence (CI)\nstrategies have demonstrated strong performance in various time series tasks,\nthey often overlook the inter-channel correlations that are critical in\nmultivariate EEG signals. This omission can lead to information degradation and\nreduced prediction accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as neurological\noutcome prediction. To address these challenges, we propose Biaxialformer,\ncharacterized by a meticulously engineered two-stage attention-based framework.\nThis model independently captures both sequence-specific (temporal) and\nchannel-specific (spatial) EEG information, promoting synergy and mutual\nreinforcement across channels without sacrificing CI. By employing joint\nlearning of positional encodings, Biaxialformer preserves both temporal and\nspatial relationships in EEG data, mitigating the interchannel correlation\nforgetting problem common in traditional CI models. Additionally, a\ntokenization module with variable receptive fields balance the extraction of\nfine-grained, localized features and broader temporal dependencies. To enhance\nspatial feature extraction, we leverage bipolar EEG signals, which capture\ninter-hemispheric brain interactions, a critical but often overlooked aspect in\nEEG analysis.

Conventional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and\nadvanced RAIM (ARAIM) rely heavily on Gaussian models in bounding nominal\nerrors, which can be overly conservative with real-world non-Gaussian errors\nwith heavy tails, such as the satellite clock and orbit errors. This paper\nproposes an extended jackknife detector capable of detecting multiple\nsimultaneous faults with non-Gaussian nominal errors. Furthermore, an integrity\nmonitoring algorithm, jackknife ARAIM, is developed by systematically\nexploiting the properties of the jackknife detector in the range domain. A\ntight bound of the integrity risk is derived by quantifying the impacts of\nhypothetical fault vectors on the position solution. The proposed method is\nexamined in worldwide simulations, with the nominal measurement error simulated\nbased on authentic experimental data, which reveals different findings in\nexisting research. In a setting of a single Global Positioning System (GPS)\nconstellation, the proposed method reduces the 99.5 percentile vertical\nprotection level (VPL) 45m, where the VPL of the baseline ARAIM is larger than\n50m in most user locations. For dual-constellation (GPS-Galileo) settings,\nbaseline ARAIM suffers VPL inflation over 60m due to the over-conservatism\ninduced by the heavy-tailed Galileo signal-in-space range errors, whereas the\nproposed jackknife ARAIM retains VPL below 40m, achieving over 92% normal\noperations for a 35m Vertical Alert Limit.

One major novelty of our proposed method is that the\nsame CKM built for wireless communication can be directly used to enable NLoS\nwireless sensing, thus enjoying the benefits of ``killing two birds with one\nstone''. To this end, the sensing targets are treated as virtual user equipment\n(UE), and the wireless communication channel priors are transformed into the\nsensing channel priors, allowing one single CKM to serve dual purposes. We\nillustrate our proposed framework by a specific CKM called \\emph{channel\nangle-delay map} (CADM). Specifically, the proposed framework utilizes CADM to\nderive angle-delay priors of the sensing channel by exploiting the relationship\nbetween communication and sensing angle-delay distributions, enabling sensing\ntarget localization in the challenging NLoS environment. Extensive simulation\nresults demonstrate significant performance improvements over classic\ngeometry-based sensing methods, which is further validated by Cram\\'er-Rao\nLower Bound (CRLB) analysis."}

Evaluating AoI under such conditions is challenging, as system\nstates become temporally correlated and traditional stationary analysis is\ninapplicable. We investigate an $M_{t}/G/1/1$ queueing system with a\ntime-varying sampling rate and probabilistic preemption, proposing a novel\nanalytical framework based on multi-dimensional partial differential equations\n(PDEs) to capture the time evolution of the system's status distribution. To\nsolve the PDEs, we develop a decomposition technique that breaks the\nhigh-dimensional PDE into lower-dimensional subsystems. Solving these\nsubsystems allows us to derive the Aol distribution at arbitrary time\ninstances. We show AoI does not exhibit a memoryless property, even with\nnegligible processing times, due to its dependence on the historical sampling\nprocess. Our framework extends to the stationary setting, where we derive a\nclosed-form expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes Transform (LST) of the\nsteady-state AoI. Numerical experiments reveal AoI exhibits a non-trivial lag\nin response to sampling rate changes. Our results also show that no single\npreemption probability or processing time distribution can minimize Aol\nviolation probability across all thresholds in either time-varying or\nstationary scenarios. Finally, we formulate an optimization problem and propose\na heuristic method to find sampling rates that reduce costs while satisfying\nAoI constraints."}

A remarkable result shown in this paper is that\nthe above challenging problem can be efficiently solved within\n$O(ML^2\\log(ML))$ time.

The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the\nthird chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient\nalgorithms.\n  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and\nextensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent\nactions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an\nagent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a\ncognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function.

It investigates how an analyst can determine\nif an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer\n(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The\nchapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing\nthe continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random\nhorizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a\nBayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise\noverview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse\nstochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.\n  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive\nLangevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions\ngiven noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms\npresented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient\nalgorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic\ngradient algorithm is in operation."}
