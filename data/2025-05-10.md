### [1] [Integrated Image Reconstruction and Target Recognition based on Deep Learning Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04836)
*Cien Zhang,Jiaming Zhang,Jiajun He,Okan Yurduseven*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力机制的生成对抗网络Att-ClassiGAN，以解决计算微波成像（CMI）在图像重建和分类中的计算瓶颈，显著提升重建速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CMI技术存在硬件要求高和数据采集慢的问题，虽然CMI已被视为替代方案，但其图像重建阶段仍面临计算瓶颈，需要更高效的算法。

Method: 在先前提出的ClassiGAN基础上，引入注意力门模块优化特征提取，通过动态聚焦重要信息来提升模型性能。

Result: Att-ClassiGAN相比传统CMI方法显著缩短了重建时间，且在NMSE、SSIM和分类准确率上优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合注意力机制，Att-ClassiGAN有效解决了CMI的计算瓶颈，为微波成像提供了更高效、精准的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational microwave imaging (CMI) has gained attention as an alternative
technique for conventional microwave imaging techniques, addressing their
limitations such as hardware-intensive physical layer and slow data collection
acquisition speed to name a few. Despite these advantages, CMI still encounters
notable computational bottlenecks, especially during the image reconstruction
stage. In this setting, both image recovery and object classification present
significant processing demands. To address these challenges, our previous work
introduced ClassiGAN, which is a generative deep learning model designed to
simultaneously reconstruct images and classify targets using only
back-scattered signals. In this study, we build upon that framework by
incorporating attention gate modules into ClassiGAN. These modules are intended
to refine feature extraction and improve the identification of relevant
information. By dynamically focusing on important features and suppressing
irrelevant ones, the attention mechanism enhances the overall model
performance. The proposed architecture, named Att-ClassiGAN, significantly
reduces the reconstruction time compared to traditional CMI approaches.
Furthermore, it outperforms current advanced methods, delivering improved
Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), higher Structural Similarity Index
(SSIM), and better classification outcomes for the reconstructed targets.

Abstract: Analog machine-learning hardware platforms promise greater speed and energy
efficiency than their digital counterparts. Specifically, over-the-air analog
computation allows offloading computation to the wireless propagation through
carefully constructed transmitted signals. In addition, reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) is emerging as a promising solution for
next-generation wireless networks, offering the ability to tailor the
communication environment. Leveraging the advantages of RIS, we design and
implement the ordinary differential equation (ODE) neural network using
over-the-air computation (AirComp) and demonstrate its effectiveness for dual
tasks. We engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment through
distributed RISs to create an architecture termed the over-the-air ordinary
differential equation (Air-ODE) network. Unlike the conventional digital
ODE-inspired neural network, the Air-ODE block utilizes the physics of wave
reflection and the reconfigurable phase shifts of RISs to implement an ODE
block in the analog domain, enhancing spectrum efficiency. Moreover, the
advantages of Air-ODE are demonstrated in a deep learning-based semantic
communication (DeepSC) system by extracting effective semantic information to
reduce the data transmission load, while achieving the dual functions of image
reconstruction and semantic tagging simultaneously at the receiver. Simulation
results show that the analog Air-ODE network can achieve similar performance to
the digital ODE-inspired network. Specifically, for the image reconstruction
and semantic tagging task, compared with the analog network without the Air-ODE
block, the Air-ODE block can achieve around 2 times gain in both reconstruction
quality and tagging accuracy.

### [4] [Experiment Study on Reference-Path-Aided System Calibration for mmWave Bistatic ISAC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05003)
*Chenhao Luo,Chongrui Wang,Aimin Tang,Fei Gao,Chaojun Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种参考路径辅助的系统校准方案，用于毫米波双基地ISAC系统，解决了同步和系统误差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双基地ISAC系统解决了自干扰消除问题，但同步误差（如STO、CFO和随机相位偏移）会严重降低感知性能。

Method: 通过利用毫米波ISAC系统中的延迟-角度稀疏特性，识别参考路径，并利用其信道参数补偿所有路径的系统误差。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方案能精确估计多普勒频移和延迟，时间同步误差控制在1纳秒以内。

Conclusion: 提出的校准方案有效提升了毫米波双基地ISAC系统的感知性能，解决了同步误差问题。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been regarded as a key
enabling technology for next-generation wireless networks. Compared to
monostatic ISAC, bistatic ISAC can eliminate the critical challenge of
self-interference cancellation and is well compatible with the existing network
infrastructures. However, the synchronization between the transmitter and the
sensing receiver becomes a crucial problem. The extracted channel state
information (CSI) for sensing under communication synchronization contains
different types of system errors, such as the sampling time offset (STO),
carrier frequency offset (CFO), and random phase shift, which can severely
degrade sensing performance or even render sensing infeasible. To address this
problem, a reference-path-aided system calibration scheme is designed for
mmWave bistatic ISAC systems, where the line-of-sight (LoS) path can be
blocked. By exploiting the delay-angle sparsity feature in mmWave ISAC systems,
the reference path, which can be either a LoS or a non-LoS (NLoS) path, is
first identified. By leveraging the fact that all the paths suffer the same
system errors, the channel parameter extracted from the reference path is
utilized to compensate for the system errors in all other paths. A mmWave ISAC
system is developed to validate our design. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed scheme can support precise estimation of Doppler shift and
delay, maintaining time-synchronization errors within 1 nanosecond.

the correlated jitter structure in a Kalman filter-type routine. Alongside, a

committed is presented, and the work is complemented with extensive synthetic
simulations and performance benchmarking with the scope of gauging and
stress-testing the techniques in different scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-frequency massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication is a
promising strategy for both 5G and future 6G systems, ensuring reliable
transmission while enhancing frequency resource utilization. Statistical
channel state information (CSI) has been widely adopted in multi-frequency
massive MIMO transmissions to reduce overhead and improve transmission
performance. In this paper, we propose efficient and accurate methods for
obtaining statistical CSI in multi-frequency massive MIMO systems. First, we
introduce a multi-frequency massive MIMO channel model and analyze the mapping
relationship between two types of statistical CSI, namely the angular power
spectrum (APS) and the spatial covariance matrix, along with their correlation
across different frequency bands. Next, we propose an autoregressive (AR)
method to predict the spatial covariance matrix of any frequency band based on
that of another frequency band. Furthermore, we emphasize that channels across
different frequency bands share similar APS characteristics. Leveraging the
maximum entropy (ME) criterion, we develop a low-complexity algorithm for
high-resolution APS estimation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
of the AR-based covariance prediction method and demonstrate the
high-resolution estimation capability of the ME-based approach. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-frequency cooperative transmission by
applying the proposed methods to obtain statistical CSI from low-frequency
bands and utilizing it for high-frequency channel transmission. This approach
significantly enhances high-frequency transmission performance while
effectively reducing system overhead.

Abstract: Sustainable energy supply and high-speed communications are two significant
needs for mobile electronic devices. This paper introduces a self-aligning
resonant beam system for simultaneous light information and power transfer
(SLIPT), employing a novel coupled spatially distributed resonator (CSDR). The
system utilizes a resonant beam for efficient power delivery and a
second-harmonic beam for concurrent data transmission, inherently minimizing
echo interference and enabling bidirectional communication. Through
comprehensive analyses, we investigate the CSDR's stable region, beam
evolution, and power characteristics in relation to working distance and device
parameters. Numerical simulations validate the CSDR-SLIPT system's feasibility
by identifying a stable beam waist location for achieving accurate mode-match
coupling between two spatially distributed resonant cavities and demonstrating
its operational range and efficient power delivery across varying distances.
The research reveals the system's benefits in terms of both safety and energy
transmission efficiency. We also demonstrate the trade-off among the
reflectivities of the cavity mirrors in the CSDR. These findings offer valuable
design insights for resonant beam systems, advancing SLIPT with significant
potential for remote device connectivity.

### [8] [Temperature-Resilient LC-RIS Phase-Shift Design for Multi-user Downlink Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05160)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了温度对基于液晶（LC）的可重构智能表面（RIS）性能的影响，并提出了温度韧性的相位偏移设计方法，显著降低了功耗和成本。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的半导体相位偏移器功耗高且成本昂贵，尤其在毫米波/亚太赫兹频段更为突出。液晶技术因其低成本、低功耗成为新趋势，但对温度敏感，需要温度韧性设计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相比忽视温度效应的基线方法，该算法在特定参数条件下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 提出的温度韧性设计有效解决了液晶RIS在变温环境中的性能问题，为其实用化提供了重要支持。

Abstract: The reflecting antenna elements in most reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs) use semiconductor-based (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes
and varactors) phase shifters. Although effective, a drawback of this
technology is the high power consumption and cost, which become particularly
prohibitive in millimeter-wave (mmWave)/sub-Terahertz range. With the advances
in Liquid Crystals (LCs) in microwave engineering, we have observed a new trend
in using LC for realizing phase shifter networks of RISs. LC-RISs are expected
to significantly reduce the fabrication costs and power consumption. However,
the nematic LC molecules are sensitive to temperature variations. Therefore,
implementing LC-RIS in geographical regions with varying temperatures requires
temperature-resilient designs. The mentioned temperature variation issue
becomes more significant at higher temperatures as the phase shifter range
reduces in warmer conditions, whereas it expands in cooler ones. In this paper,
we study the impact of temperature on the operation of LC-RISs and develop a
temperature-resilient phase shift design. Specifically, we formulate a max-min
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio optimization for a multi-user downlink
mmWave network that accounts for the impact of temperature in the LC-RIS phase
shifts. The simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement for the
considered set of parameters when using our algorithm compared to the baseline
approach, which neglects the temperature effects.

### [9] [From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated Sleep Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05371)
*Niklas Grieger,Siamak Mehrkanoon,Philipp Ritter,Stephan Bialonski*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究评估了使用最先进机器学习模型（RobustSleepNet和SUMOv2）完全自动化睡眠分析的可行性，成功复现了专家研究中关于双相情感障碍的关键发现，并显著提高了分析效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化睡眠分析可以提高大规模研究的效率并减少人工评分带来的差异，但多步骤自动化分析的可行性尚不明确。

Method: 使用RobustSleepNet进行睡眠分期，SUMOv2进行纺锤波检测，完全自动化分析双相情感障碍患者的睡眠数据。

Result: 自动化分析在几分钟内复现了专家研究中数月完成的关键结果，模型性能达到或超过人工评分一致性。

Conclusion: 全自动化方法有潜力推动大规模睡眠研究，并已公开发布分析工具和隐私保护平台SomnoBot。

Abstract: Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages)
and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable
large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater
incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle
detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating
multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully
automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep
staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can
replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The
automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based
study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between
bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously
took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis
differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases
between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually
performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle
detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the
potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public
access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and
introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.

### [10] [Chirp-Based Aliasing Analysis of Arrays in the Spherical Wavefront Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05378)
*Gilles Monnoyer,Laurence Defraigne,Baptiste Sambon,Jérôme Louveaux,Luc Vandendorpe*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的、基于啁啾的球形波前域（SWR）中导向向量的解释方法，分析了有限天线数量引起的空间采样混叠效应，并提供了对非空间不变混叠机制的几何理解。

Result: 结果为球形波前域中的非空间不变混叠机制提供了几何视角，展示了阵列几何和信号频谱之间的直接关系。

Conclusion: 论文的结论强调了提出的方法为天线阵列中的波前建模提供了新的视角，特别是在近场条件下，有助于优化阵列设计以减轻混叠效应。

Abstract: In antenna arrays, wave propagation modeling based on Euclidean principles is
typically represented by steering vectors or signals. This paper provides a
new, chirp-based, interpretation of steering vectors in the Spherical Wavefront
Regime (SWR), establishing a relationship between the spatial spectrum of the
received (resp. transmitted) signal and the geometry of the array and the
source (resp. target). Leveraging the well-known sampling theorem, we analyze
aliasing effects arising from spatial sampling with a finite number of antennas
and understand how these effects degrade the Ambiguity Function (AF). Our
framework provides geometric insight into these degradations, offering a deeper
understanding of the non-space-invariant aliasing mechanisms in the SWR. The
proposed approach is formulated for general antenna arrays and then
instantiated to Circular Array and to Uniform Linear Array structures operating
in Near Field conditions.

Motivation: 探索ApoE基因变异对呼吸功能的具体影响，特别是不同基因型在呼吸模式和熵统计上的差异，填补该领域的知识空白。

Method: 通过体积描记术（PLETH）数据，分析两种ApoE基因型（gene59和gene95）大鼠的呼吸波形特征和熵统计，比较活动和静息状态下的差异，并研究叹息后的呼吸指标变化。

Result: 发现两种基因型在常见呼吸指标和近似熵上存在显著分布差异，且叹息会暂时改变熵和其他呼吸指标。

Conclusion: ApoE基因型差异显著影响呼吸模式和熵统计，为基因与呼吸功能的关系提供了新见解。

Abstract: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene variations are involved in lipid metabolism and
cholesterol transport, with the ApoE4 allele being a known risk factor
associated with neurodegenerative conditions later in life. Emerging evidence
suggests these genetic variations may also influence respiratory function and
vitality. However, the specific impact of different ApoE genotypes on breathing
patterns remains largely unexplored. This work investigates differences in
breathing waveform characteristics and entropy statistics derived from
plethysmography (PLETH) data between rat models possessing two distinct ApoE
genotypes (referred to herein as gene59 and gene95). Findings reveal
significant distributional differences in common plethysmography metrics and
approximate entropy between the two genotypes, observed during both active and
resting states. Additionally, the study examines the transient impact of sighs
(deep breaths) on these breathing metrics, demonstrating that entropy and other
measures are altered in the breaths immediately following a sigh.

### [12] [On the Multiangle Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05388)
*Christian Oswald,Franz Pernkopf*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的多角度离散分数傅里叶变换（MA-DFRFT），通过简化计算步骤减少了对FFT的需求，适用于资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MA-CDFRFT仅限于中心离散分数傅里叶变换（CDFRFT），而标准DFRFT的研究提供了更多的特征向量选择，因此需要一种高效计算标准DFRFT的方法。

Method: 通过简单调整MA-CDFRFT，提出了多角度DFRFT（MA-DFRFT），并利用对称性将FFT计算量减半。

Result: 实现了标准DFRFT的高效计算，显著减少了FFT的使用量。

Conclusion: 改进后的MA-DFRFT不仅扩展了应用范围，还降低了计算复杂度，为资源受限环境提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The efficiently computed multiangle centered discrete fractional Fourier
transform (MA-CDFRFT) [1] has proven as a useful tool for time-frequency
analysis; however, its scope is limited to the centered discrete fractional
Fourier transform (CDFRFT). Meanwhile, extensive research on the standard DFRFT
has lead to a better understanding of this transform as well as numerous
possible choices for eigenvectors for implementation. In this letter we present
a simple adaptation of the MA-CDFRFT which allows us to efficiently compute its
standard counterpart, which we call the multiangle DFRFT (MA-DFRFT).
Furthermore, we formalize the symmetries inherent to the MA-CDFRFT and MA-DFRFT
to halve the number of FFTs needed to compute these transforms, paving the way
for applications in resource constrained environments.

*Muhammad Asad Ullah,Antti Heikkinen,Mikko Uitto,Antti Anttonen,Konstantin Mikhaylov*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 研究发现，天气条件（如降雨和云覆盖）显著影响Starlink FHP终端的吞吐量，但对往返时间无明显影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Starlink在高纬度地区的性能受天气影响尚未详细研究，本文填补了这一空白。

Method: 在芬兰奥卢进行实地测量，分析降雨和云覆盖对吞吐量的影响。

Result: 降雨导致中位数上下行吞吐量下降52.27%和37.84%，云覆盖增加与吞吐量下降呈负相关。

Conclusion: 天气条件对Starlink性能有显著影响，需在极端天气地区优化部署策略。

Abstract: Satellite communications have emerged as one of the most feasible solutions
to provide global wireless coverage and connect the unconnected. Starlink
dominates the market with over 7,000 operational satellites in low Earth orbit
(LEO) and offers global high-speed and low-latency Internet service for
stationary and mobile use cases, including in-motion connectivity for vehicles,
vessels, and aircraft. Starlink terminals are designed to handle extreme
weather conditions. Starlink recommends a flat high performance (FHP) terminal
for users living in areas with extreme weather conditions. The earlier studies
evaluated Starlink's FHP throughput for stationary and in-motion users without
providing a detailed analysis of how weather affects its performance. There
remains a need to investigate the impact of weather on FHP's throughput. In
this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing the impact of weather on
Starlink's performance in Oulu, Finland, a city located in Northern Europe near
the Arctic Circle. Our measurements reveal that rain degrades median uplink and
downlink throughput by 52.27% and 37.84%, respectively. On the contrary, there
was no noticeable impact on the round-trip time. Additionally, we also examine
the impact of cloud cover on the Starlink throughput. The linear regression
analysis reveals the negative relationship between throughput and cloud cover.
The cloud cover of up to 12.5% has around 20% greater throughput than the cloud
cover of 87.5%

Abstract: The sixth generation of wireless networks defined several key performance
indicators (KPIs) for assessing its networks, mainly in terms of reliability,
coverage, and sensing. In this regard, remarkable attention has been paid
recently to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm as an
enabler for efficiently and jointly performing communication and sensing using
the same spectrum and hardware resources. On the other hand, ensuring
communication and data security has been an imperative requirement for wireless
networks throughout their evolution. The physical-layer security (PLS) concept
paved the way to catering to the security needs in wireless networks in a
sustainable way while guaranteeing theoretically secure transmissions,
independently of the computational capacity of adversaries. Therefore, it is of
paramount importance to consider a balanced trade-off between communication
reliability, sensing, and security in future networks, such as the 5G and
beyond, and the 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and system-wise
review of designed secure ISAC systems from a PLS point of view. In particular,
the impact of various physical-layer techniques, schemes, and wireless
technologies to ensure the sensing-security trade-off is studied from the
surveyed work. Furthermore, the amalgamation of PLS and ISAC is analyzed in a
broader impact by considering attacks targeting data confidentiality,
communication covertness, and sensing spoofing. The paper also serves as a
tutorial by presenting several theoretical foundations on ISAC and PLS, which
represent a practical guide for readers to develop novel secure ISAC network

TL;DR: 本文研究了6DMA增强的THz网络，通过控制天线的3D位置和旋转来支持多用户，但面临近远场混合和信道估计复杂性问题，提出了一种高效混合场信道模型和低开销估计算法。

Abstract: In this work, we study a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-enhanced
Terahertz (THz) network that supports a large number of users with a few
antennas by controlling the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations
of antenna surfaces/subarrays at the base station (BS). However, the short
wavelength of THz signals combined with a large 6DMA movement range extends the
near-field region. As a result, a user can be in the far-field region relative
to the antennas on one 6DMA surface, while simultaneously residing in the
near-field region relative to other 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, 6DMA THz channel
estimation suffers from increased computational complexity and pilot overhead
due to uneven power distribution across the large number of candidate
position-rotation pairs, as well as the limited number of radio frequency (RF)
chains in THz bands. To address these issues, we propose an efficient
hybrid-field generalized 6DMA THz channel model, which accounts for planar wave
propagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical waves among different
6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, we propose a low-overhead channel estimation
algorithm that leverages directional sparsity to construct a complete channel
map for all potential antenna position-rotation pairs.
  Numerical results show that the proposed hybrid-field channel model achieves
a sum rate close to that of the ground-truth near-field channel model and
confirm that the channel estimation method yields accurate results with low
complexity.

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过整合VLC与RIS技术来增强物理层安全性，提出两种优化框架以最大化最低保密率和能效，比较了RSMA与NOMA方案，并采用遗传算法求解复杂优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLC系统的安全性和保密性需要增强，RIS技术提供了精确方向控制和动态环境适应的能力，结合RSMA和NOMA方案进一步优化系统性能。

Method: 提出两种联合优化框架（功率分配、RIS关联及元件方向角），采用遗传算法解决混合整数非线性规划问题。

Result: 仿真显示RSMA方案在保密率和能效上均优于NOMA，同时分析了用户速率要求、RIS元件数量等因素对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升VLC系统安全性提供了有效方法，RSMA方案的优越性及遗传算法的实用性得到了验证。

Abstract: Integrating VLC with the RIS significantly enhances physical layer security
by enabling precise directional signal control and dynamic adaptation to the
communication environment. These capabilities strengthen the confidentiality
and security of VLC systems. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
joint optimization of VLC AP power allocation, RIS association, and RIS
elements orientation angles for secure VLC systems, while considering RSMA and
power-domain NOMA schemes. Specifically, two frameworks are proposed to
maximize both the minimum secrecy rate (SR) and the minimum secrecy energy
efficiency (SEE) by jointly optimizing power allocation, RIS association, and
RIS elements orientation angles for both power-domain NOMA and RSMA-based VLC
systems. The proposed frameworks consider random device orientation and
guarantee the minimum user-rate requirement. The proposed optimization
frameworks belong to the class of mixed integer nonlinear programming, which
has no known feasible solution methodology to guarantee the optimal solution.
Moreover, the increased degree of freedom and flexibility from the joint
consideration of power control, RIS association and element orientation results
in a large set of decision variables and constraints, which further complicates
the optimization problem. To that end, we utilize a genetic algorithm-based
solution method, which through its exploration and exploitation capabilities
can obtain a good quality solution. Additionally, comprehensive simulations
show that the RSMA scheme outperforms the power-domain NOMA scheme across both
the SR and SEE metrics over various network parameters. Furthermore, useful
insights on the impact of minimum user rate requirement, number of RIS
elements, and maximum VLC AP transmit power on the minimum SR and SEE
performances are provided.

### [17] [Accurate and Fast Channel Estimation for Fluid Antenna Systems with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04930)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的高效信道估计方法，适用于高维度流体天线系统（FAS），通过离线训练和在线采样策略，显著提升了估计精度和计算速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维度FAS中信道状态信息（CSI）获取困难，传统方法难以应对大量可重构端口和有限的RF链资源。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用扩散模型（DM）结合简化的U-Net架构，离线无监督训练后，在线通过后验采样和去噪扩散恢复模型（DDRM）重建CSI，并引入跳步采样策略降低计算成本。

Result: 仿真显示，该方法在估计精度上显著优于现有压缩感知方法，速度提升超过20倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在高维度FAS中具有实际应用潜力，为高效CSI获取提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer enhanced spatial diversity for
next-generation wireless systems. However, acquiring accurate channel state
information (CSI) remains challenging due to the large number of reconfigurable
ports and the limited availability of radio-frequency (RF) chains --
particularly in high-dimensional FAS scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose an efficient posterior sampling-based channel estimator that leverages
a diffusion model (DM) with a simplified U-Net architecture to capture the
spatial correlation structure of two-dimensional FAS channels. The DM is
initially trained offline in an unsupervised way and then applied online as a
learned implicit prior to reconstruct CSI from partial observations via
posterior sampling through a denoising diffusion restoration model (DDRM). To
accelerate the online inference, we introduce a skipped sampling strategy that
updates only a subset of latent variables during the sampling process, thereby
reducing the computational cost with minimal accuracy degradation. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher
estimation accuracy and over 20x speedup compared to state-of-the-art
compressed sensing-based methods, highlighting its potential for practical
deployment in high-dimensional FAS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时频相移导频（TFPSPs）的大规模MIMO-OFDM系统信道获取方法，通过三波束域信道张量模型和优化的导频设计，降低了复杂度并提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a channel acquisition approach with time-frequency
phase-shifted pilots (TFPSPs) for massive multi-input multi-output orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We first present a
triple-beam (TB) based channel tensor model, allowing for the representation of
the space-frequency-time (SFT) domain channel as the product of beam matrices
and the TB domain channel tensor. By leveraging the specific characteristics of
TB domain channels, we develop TFPSPs, where distinct pilot signals are
simultaneously transmitted in the frequency and time domains. Then, we present
the optimal TFPSP design and provide the corresponding pilot scheduling
algorithm. Further, we propose a tensor-based information geometry approach
(IGA) to estimate the TB domain channel tensors. Leveraging the specific
structure of beam matrices and the properties of TFPSPs, we propose a
low-complexity implementation of the tensor-based IGA. We validate the
efficiency of our proposed channel acquisition approach through extensive
simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our
approach. The proposed approach can effectively suppress inter-UT interference
with low complexity and limited pilot overhead, thereby enhancing channel
estimation performance. Particularly in scenarios with a large number of UTs,
the channel acquisition method outperforms existing approaches by reducing the
normalized mean square error (NMSE) by more than 8 dB.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分散式基带处理（DBP）架构的流体天线系统（FAS）优化方法，通过分簇并行处理降低计算成本，并利用新型分散式块坐标上升（BCA）算法联合优化波束成形和天线位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体天线系统（FAS）为无线通信提供了前所未有的自由度，但大规模天线位置优化计算成本高，亟需高效分散式解决方案。

Method: 采用分散式基带处理（DBP）架构将天线阵列分簇，提出基于矩阵分数规划和MM方法的分散式BCA算法，联合优化波束成形和天线位置。

Conclusion: DBP架构结合分散式算法显著降低了FAS的优化成本，为大规模FAS部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology,
offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) for wireless communication
systems. However, optimizing fluid antenna (FA) positions entails significant
computational costs, especially when the number of FAs is large. To address
this challenge, we introduce a decentralized baseband processing (DBP)
architecture to FAS, which partitions the FA array into clusters and enables
parallel processing. Based on the DBP architecture, we formulate a weighted sum
rate (WSR) maximization problem through joint beamforming and FA position
design for FA-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)
systems. To solve the WSR maximization problem, we propose a novel
decentralized block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based algorithm that leverages
matrix fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods.
The proposed decentralized algorithm achieves low computational, communication,
and storage costs, thus unleashing the potential of the DBP architecture.
Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm under the DBP architecture
reduces computational time by over 70% compared to centralized architectures
with negligible WSR performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着下一代无线网络中天线孔径和传输频率的增加，近场通信（NFC）技术发展迅速。由于极大尺度天线阵列（ELAA）的应用，信道矩阵的空间自由度显著增强，这为设计安全通信方案提供了新的机会。

Abstract: The increase in antenna apertures and transmission frequencies in
next-generation wireless networks is catalyzing advancements in near-field
communications (NFC). In this paper, we investigate secure transmission in
near-field multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenarios.
Specifically, with the advent of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA)
applied in the NFC regime, the spatial degrees of freedom in the channel matrix
are significantly enhanced. This creates an expanded null space that can be
exploited for designing secure communication schemes. Motivated by this
observation, we propose a near-field dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture
incorporating artificial noise, which effectively disrupts eavesdroppers at any
undesired positions, even in the absence of their channel state information
(CSI). Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the dynamic precoder's
performance in terms of the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio,
achievable rate, secrecy capacity, secrecy outage probability, and the size of
the secrecy zone. In contrast to far-field secure transmission techniques that
only enhance security in the angular dimension, the proposed algorithm exploits
the unique properties of spherical wave characteristics in NFC to achieve
secure transmission in both the angular and distance dimensions. Remarkably,
the proposed algorithm is applicable to arbitrary modulation types and array
configurations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
approximately 20\% higher rate capacity compared to zero-forcing and the
weighted minimum mean squared error precoders.
