### [1] [Efficient Near-Field Beam Focusing Merging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit and CVX for Large Intelligent Surface Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09711)
*Jiawang Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于6G网络中大智能表面（LIS）的高效近场波束成形方法，通过预选稀疏目标位置和镜像对称策略显著降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统凸优化方法在大规模阵列矩阵中进行稀疏选择时计算效率低下，亟需一种更高效的方法以满足6G网络的需求。

Method: 先基于正交匹配追踪（OMP）预选稀疏目标位置，并采用坐标镜像对称简化计算；随后对预选稀疏阵列应用凸优化（CVX），直至满足阈值。

Result: 与常规方法相比，该方法在121和441个元素下分别提升效率15.12倍和96.73倍，表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅性能满意，还为大规模近场阵列系统提供了可行的波束聚焦技术方案。

Abstract: In this paper, an efficient near-field beamforming method is proposed to
support the large intelligent surfaces (LIS) that are expected to be widely
deployed in 6G networks. This approach avoids directly applying convex (CVX)
optimization for sparse selection in large-size array matrices, as such methods
often lead to excessive computational time due to blind searching to satisfy a
series of objective functions. First, based on the objective function, we
prioritize a key component and employ the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)
method to pre-select potential sparse target positions. To ensure focal
symmetry, a coordinate mirror symmetry approach is adopted, meaning that
selection is performed only in the first quadrant, while the remaining
quadrants are determined through mirror symmetry relative to the first
quadrant. This significantly reduces computational complexity at an early
stage. Next, CVX is applied based on the pre-selected sparse array. Once a
predefined threshold is met, a solution is obtained that satisfies the
constraints of the beamfocusing. The results demonstrate that, compared with
conventional methods, this approach improves efficiency by 15.12 times with 121
elements and 96.73 times with 441 elements. The proposed method demonstrates
not only satisfactory performance but also considerable potential as a beam
focusing technique for large-scale near-field array systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为未来卫星物联网网络中的延迟敏感和节能链路适配提供高效信道状态预测方案。

Method: 采用两阶段信道压缩策略（参考端口选择和可分离PCA），并嵌入LoRA适应的LLM进行时间序列预测。

Result: 比GRU、LSTM和Transformer等基线模型表现更优，NMSE提升10 dB，RMSE降低三倍，预测信道保留物理层特性。

Conclusion: 验证了基于LLM的信道预测在卫星物联网网络中的潜力和有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes FAS-LLM, a novel large language model (LLM)-based
architecture for predicting future channel states in Orthogonal Time Frequency
Space (OTFS)-enabled satellite downlinks equipped with fluid antenna systems
(FAS). The proposed method introduces a two-stage channel compression strategy
combining reference-port selection and separable principal component analysis
(PCA) to extract compact, delay-Doppler-aware representations from
high-dimensional OTFS channels. These representations are then embedded into a
LoRA-adapted LLM, enabling efficient time-series forecasting of channel
coefficients. Performance evaluations demonstrate that FAS-LLM outperforms
classical baselines including GRU, LSTM, and Transformer models, achieving up
to 10 dB normalized mean squared error (NMSE) improvement and threefold root
mean squared error (RMSE) reduction across prediction horizons. Furthermore,
the predicted channels preserve key physical-layer characteristics, enabling
near-optimal performance in ergodic capacity, spectral efficiency, and outage
probability across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). These results
highlight the potential of LLM-based forecasting for delay-sensitive and
energy-efficient link adaptation in future satellite IoT networks.

Conclusion: 研究证明，在THz频段通信的信道建模中，必须考虑这些关键效应，以实现物理上一致且精确的建模。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided terahertz (THz)-band
communications are promising enablers for future wireless networks. However,
array densification at high frequencies introduces significant challenges in
accurate channel modeling and estimation, particularly with THz-specific
fading, mutual coupling (MC), spatial correlation, and near-field effects. In
this work, we model THz outdoor small-scale fading channels using the mixture
gamma (MG) distribution, considering absorption losses, spherical wave
propagation, MC, and spatial correlation across large base stations and RISs.
We derive the distribution of the cascaded RIS-aided channel and investigate
linear channel estimation techniques, analyzing the impact of various channel
parameters. Numerical results based on precise THz parameters reveal that
accounting for spatial correlation, MC, and near-field modeling substantially
enhances estimation accuracy, especially in ultra-massive arrays and
short-range scenarios. These results underscore the importance of incorporating
these effects for precise, physically consistent channel modeling.

Abstract: There is currently a paradigm shift in several power system monitoring
applications, such as incipient fault detection and monitoring inverter-based
resources, to transition from traditional phasor analytics to more informative
waveform analytics. This paper contributes to this transition by developing a
novel approach to modeling voltage and current waveform measurements using
implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs are continuous function
approximators that are recently used in vision and signal processing. The
proposed INR models are specifically designed to meet the requirements of
waveform analytics in power systems, such as by using sinusoidal activation
functions that capture the periodic nature of voltage and current waveforms. We
also propose extended models that can efficiently represent correlated
waveforms, such as three-phase waveforms and synchro-waveforms. Real-world case
studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed INR models in terms of
accuracy (<1-2% MSE) and model size (4-6x compression). We also investigate the
application of INR models in oscillation monitoring, for single mode
oscillations and dual mode modulated oscillations.

Abstract: Conformal phased arrays promise shape-changing properties, multiple degrees
of freedom to the scan angle, and novel applications in wearables, aerospace,
defense, vehicles, and ships. However, they have suffered from two critical
limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication
and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic
deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic
Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip
real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2)
Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility,
but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based
on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance
and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper
Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with < 0.1% variation per degree C with
temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using
the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation
correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable
due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.

Abstract: In the rapid evolution of the non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), satellite
communication has emerged as a focal area of research due to its critical role
in enabling seamless global connectivity. In this paper, we investigate two
representative user association policies (UAPs) for multi-tier heterogeneous
satellite networks (HetSatNets), namely the nearest satellite UAP and the
maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (max-SINR) satellite UAP, where
each tier is characterized by a distinct constellation configuration and
transmission pattern. Employing stochastic geometric, we analyze various
intermediate system aspects, including the probability of a typical user
accessing each satellite tier, the aggregated interference power, and their
corresponding Laplace transforms (LTs) under both UAPs. Subsequently, we derive
explicit expressions for coverage probability (CP), non-handover probability
(NHP), and time delay outage probability (DOP) of the typical user.
Furthermore, we propose a novel weighted metric (WM) that integrates CP, NHP,
and DOP to explore their trade-offs in the system design. The robustness of the
theoretical framework is verified is verified through Monte Carlo simulations
calibrated with the actual Starlink constellation, affirming the precision of
our analytical approach. The empirical findings underscore an optimal UAP in
various HetSatNet scenarios regarding CP, NHP, and DOP..

### [7] [Constrained Multimodal Sensing-Aided Communications: A Dynamic Beamforming Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10015)
*Abolfazl Zakeri,Nhan Thanh Nguyen,Ahmed Alkhateeb,Markku Juntti*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种受约束的多模态感知辅助通信框架，通过动态感知和波束成形优化通信性能，同时在感知资源有限的条件下平衡性能与开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态感知数据虽然能提升通信系统的性能（如减少波束训练的开销和延迟），但其高计算复杂性和持续的感知会带来显著的功耗和带宽消耗。因此需要在感知数据获取率与通信性能之间进行权衡。

Method: 构建了一个基于约束条件的多模态感知辅助通信框架，通过优化问题最大化用户设备的平均接收信噪比（SNR），同时约束感知动作的平均次数和功率预算。采用Lyapunov优化方法，开发了动态感知和波束成形算法。

Result: 数值评估显示，在DeepSense和Raymobtime数据集上，感知时间减半仅导致平均SNR最多下降7.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架在有限的感知预算下实现了通信性能的有效优化，证明了其在高效率和低开销条件下的实用性。

Abstract: Using multimodal sensory data can enhance communications systems by reducing
the overhead and latency in beam training. However, processing such data incurs
high computational complexity, and continuous sensing results in significant
power and bandwidth consumption. This gives rise to a tradeoff between the
(multimodal) sensing data acquisition rate and communications performance. In
this work, we develop a constrained multimodal sensing-aided communications
framework where dynamic sensing and beamforming are performed under a sensing
budget. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the
average received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of user equipment, subject to
constraints on the average number of sensing actions and power budget. Using
the Saleh-Valenzuela mmWave channel model, we construct the channel primarily
based on position information obtained via multimodal sensing. Stricter sensing
constraints reduce the availability of position data, leading to degraded
channel estimation and thus lower performance. We apply Lyapunov optimization
to solve the problem and derive a dynamic sensing and beamforming algorithm.
Numerical evaluations on the DeepSense and Raymobtime datasets show that
halving sensing times leads to only up to 7.7% loss in average SNR.

Motivation: 探讨下一代无线通信系统中辐射近场与感知能力的结合，重点分析不同天线阵列配置对感知性能的影响。

Method: 通过分析推导和仿真，比较SIMO/MISO和MIMO配置下的近场范围和感知分辨率，并使用二次近似验证结果。

Result: MIMO配置相比单孔径系统将最大近场范围和感知分辨率提高了约1.4倍，理论推导改进因子为√2。

Conclusion: MIMO处理显著提升近场感知性能，为未来无线通信系统的设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The radiative near-field and integration of sensing capabilities are seen as
two key components of the next generation of wireless communication systems. In
this paper, the sensing performance of a narrowband near-field system is
investigated for several practical antenna array geometries and configurations,
namely SIMO/MISO and MIMO. In the SIMO/MISO configuration, the antenna aperture
is exploited only a single time for either transmit or receive signal
processing, while the MIMO configuration exploits both TX and RX processing.
Analytical derivations, supported by simulations, show that the MIMO processing
improves the maximum near-field range and sensing resolution by approximately a
factor of 1.4 as compared to single-aperture systems. The value of the
improvement factor is consistent for all considered array geometries. Finally,
using a quadratic approximation of the array factor, an analytical improvement
factor of $\sqrt{2}$ is derived, clarifying the observed improvements and
validating the numerical results.

### [9] [Angle diversity receiver as a key enabler for reliable ORIS-based Visible Light Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10129)
*Borja Genoves Guzman,Maximo Morales-Cespedes,Ana Garcia Armada,Maite Brandt-Pearce*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在可见光通信（VLC）中结合角度分集接收器（ADR）和光学可重构智能表面（ORIS）以解决链路阻塞问题，并展示了其互补性和性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无线数据需求增长，VLC成为一种有前景的解决方案，但链路阻塞是主要挑战。研究通过ADR和ORIS的结合来缓解这一问题。

Method: 采用ORIS作为小型可移动镜子，与ADR结合使用，提出了一个优化算法以最大化最小信噪比（SNR），确保公平通信网络。

Result: 数值结果表明，结合ADR和ORIS显著提升了VLC性能，SNR增益高达30 dB，并有效减少了链路阻塞或接收信号超出视场导致的通信中断。

Conclusion: 论文证明ADR与ORIS的结合在VLC系统中具有显著优势，尤其是ADR的单层光电二极管已足够配合ORIS提升性能。

Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) offers a promising solution to satisfy the
increasing demand for wireless data. However, link blockages remain a
significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by investigating the
combined use of angle diversity receivers (ADRs) and optical reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (ORISs) in multiuser VLC systems. We consider ORIS
elements as small movable mirrors. We demonstrate the complementarity of ADR
and ORIS in mitigating link blockages, as well as the advantages of using a
larger number of ORIS elements due to the increased field-of-view (FoV) at the
receiver enabled by the ADR. An optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize
the minimum signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) to deploy a fair communication
network. Numerical results show that integrating ADR and ORIS significantly
enhances VLC communication performance, achieving an SNR gain of up to 30 dB
compared to a system without ORIS, and mitigating communication outages
produced by link blockages or out-of-FoV received signals. We also prove that
an ADR with a single tier of photodiodes is sufficient to complement
ORIS-assisted VLC.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自监督学习的无线定位基础模型LWLM，通过多任务预训练提升定位准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有数据驱动方法在无线定位中需要大量标注数据且泛化能力不足的问题，探索自监督学习提升模型性能。

Method: 设计了一个包含空间-频率掩码信道建模、域变换不变性和位置不变对比学习的自监督框架，并进行多任务预训练。

Result: 实验表明LWLM在所有定位任务中均优于基线模型，特别是在标注数据有限和未见过基站配置时表现出强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: LWLM作为无线定位的基础模型展现出显著优势，为5G/6G应用提供了高鲁棒性的定位解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G
applications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart
manufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing
models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across
deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations,
we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless
localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL)
tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on
information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a
pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model
(LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three
complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling
(SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii)
position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly
capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple
perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks,
including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation,
single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization.
Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses
both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization
tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer
models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under
label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its
potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.

*Qiushi Liang,Yeyue Cai,Jianhua Mo,Meixia Tao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的框架CFARNet，用卷积神经网络代替传统CFAR检测器，显著提高了多目标检测的精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFAR检测器在毫米波OFDM雷达中难以准确检测密集多目标，尤其在高噪声环境下表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效、鲁棒的方法。

Method: CFARNet利用CNN在角度-多普勒域进行峰值检测，预测目标子载波索引，并通过已知的频率-角度映射及MUSIC算法实现高分辨率测距和测速。

Result: 仿真表明，CFARNet在低发射功率和多目标密集条件下显著优于传统CFAR+MUSIC方法，具有更高的角度分辨率、更强的低信噪比鲁棒性和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了数据驱动方法在高分辨率毫米波雷达感知中的潜力，为未来实际应用提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) OFDM radar equipped with rainbow beamforming,
enabled by joint phase-time arrays (JPTAs), provides wide-angle coverage and is
well-suited for fast real-time target detection and tracking. However, accurate
detection of multiple closely spaced targets remains a key challenge for
conventional signal processing pipelines, particularly those relying on
constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors. This paper presents CFARNet, a
learning-based processing framework that replaces CFAR with a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for peak detection in the angle-Doppler domain. The
network predicts target subcarrier indices, which guide angle estimation via a
known frequency-angle mapping and enable high-resolution range and velocity
estimation using the MUSIC algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that
CFARNet significantly outperforms a CFAR+MUSIC baseline, especially under low
transmit power and dense multi-target conditions. The proposed method offers
superior angular resolution, enhanced robustness in low-SNR scenarios, and
improved computational efficiency, highlighting the potential of data-driven
approaches for high-resolution mmWave radar sensing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双静态传感在集成感知与通信系统中具有潜力，但收发端时钟不同步导致的时变时偏和相位偏移带来巨大挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了时钟异步问题，为集成感知与通信系统的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Bi-static sensing is an attractive configuration for integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) systems; however, clock asynchronism between widely
separated transmitters and receivers introduces time-varying time offsets (TO)
and phase offsets (PO), posing significant challenges. This paper introduces a
signal-subspace-based framework that estimates decoupled angles, delays, and
complex gain sequences (CGS)-- the target-reflected signals -- for multiple
dynamic target paths. The proposed framework begins with a novel TO alignment
algorithm, leveraging signal subspace or covariance, to mitigate TO variations
across temporal snapshots, enabling coherent delay-domain analysis.
Subsequently, subspace-based methods are developed to compensate for TO
residuals and to perform joint angle-delay estimation. Finally, leveraging the
high resolution in the joint angle-delay domain, the framework compensates for
the PO and estimates the CGS for each target. The framework can be applied to
both single-antenna and multi-antenna systems. Extensive simulations and
experiments using commercial Wi-Fi devices demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly surpasses existing solutions in parameter estimation
accuracy and delay resolution. Notably, it uniquely achieves a super-resolution
in the delay domain, with a probability-of-resolution curve tightly approaching
that in synchronized systems.

Conclusion: PASS在ISAC中展现出更高的灵活性，能够实现更优的通信与感知性能，为未来无线系统设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: The Pinching-Antenna SyStem (PASS) reconstructs wireless channels through
\emph{pinching beamforming}, wherein the activated positions of pinching
antennas along dielectric waveguides are optimized to shape the radiation
pattern. The aim of this article is to analyze the performance limits of
employing PASS in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Specifically, a
PASS-assisted ISAC system is considered, where a pinched waveguide is utilized
to simultaneously communicate with a user and sense a target. Closed-form
expressions for the achievable communication rate (CR) and sensing rate (SR)
are derived to characterize the information-theoretic limits of this
dual-functional operation. \romannumeral1) For the single-pinch case,
closed-form solutions for the optimal pinching antenna location are derived
under \emph{sensing-centric (S-C)}, \emph{communications-centric (C-C)}, and
\emph{Pareto-optimal} designs. On this basis, the CR-SR trade-off is
characterized by deriving the full CR-SR rate region, which is shown to
encompass that of conventional fixed-antenna systems. \romannumeral2) For the
multiple-pinch case, an antenna location refinement method is applied to obtain
the optimal C-C and S-C pinching beamformers. As a further advance, inner and
outer bounds on the achievable CR-SR region are derived using an element-wise
alternating optimization technique and by invoking Cauchy-Schwarz and
Karamata's inequalities, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate that:
\romannumeral1) the derived bounds closely approximate the true CR-SR region;
and \romannumeral2) PASS can achieve a significantly larger rate region than
conventional-antenna systems.

Abstract: Fingerprint-based passive localization enables high localization accuracy
using low-cost UWB IoT radio sensors. However, fingerprinting demands extensive
effort for data acquisition. The concept of channel charting reduces this
effort by modeling and projecting the manifold of \ac{csi} onto a 2D coordinate
space. So far, researchers only applied this concept to active radio
localization, where a mobile device intentionally and actively emits a specific
signal. In this paper, we apply channel charting to passive localization. We
use a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system to estimate a target's velocity
and derive a distance matrix from it. We then use this matrix to learn a
distance-preserving embedding in 2D space, which serves as a fingerprinting
model. In our experiments, we deploy six nodes in a fully connected
ultra-wideband (UWB) mesh network to show that our method achieves high
localization accuracy, with an average error of just 0.24\,m, even when we
train and test on different targets.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于无人机搭载智能反射面（IRS）的被动6D可移动天线（6DMA）系统，通过联合优化发射波束成形、IRS的3D位置和方向以及反射系数，显著提升了集成感测与通信（ISAC）系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升集成感测与通信（ISAC）系统的性能是一项重要挑战，论文旨在通过优化无人机IRS的6D空间灵活性和反射特性，改善感测与通信之间的性能权衡。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先优化IRS的3D位置、方向和反射系数以增强信道相关性和功率增益，随后推导ISAC基站的发射波束成形闭式解。

Conclusion: 被动6DMA支持的ISAC系统通过联合优化设计，有效提升了感测与通信的性能权衡。

Abstract: Improving the fundamental performance trade-off in integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) systems has been deemed as one of the most significant
challenges. To address it, we propose in this letter a novel ISAC system that
leverages an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS) and the UAV's maneuverability in six-dimensional (6D) space,
i.e., three-dimensional (3D) location and 3D rotation, thus referred to as
passive 6D movable antenna (6DMA). We aim to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) for sensing a single target while ensuring a minimum SNR at a
communication user equipment (UE), by jointly optimizing the transmit
beamforming at the ISAC base station (BS), the 3D location and orientation as
well as the reflection coefficients of the IRS. To solve this challenging
non-convex optimization problem, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first
stage, we aim to optimize the IRS's 3D location, 3D orientation, and reflection
coefficients to enhance both the channel correlations and power gains for
sensing and communication. Given their optimized parameters, the optimal
transmit beamforming at the ISAC BS is derived in closed form. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed passive 6DMA-enabled ISAC system
significantly improves the sensing and communication trade-off by
simultaneously enhancing channel correlations and power gains, and outperforms
other baseline schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G的发展，ISAC被认为是重要场景之一，但现有通信中心通道模型（如3GPP TR 38.901）无法满足ISAC的需求，因此需要研究适用于ISAC的通道模型。

Method: 3GPP和ETSI ISAC ISG分别研究了基础和高阶通道模型，以支持多样化的ISAC用例。

Conclusion: 本文总结了3GPP和ETSI ISG在ISAC通道模型上的进展，为6G的综合ISAC通道模型提供了基础。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is defined as one of six usage
scenarios in the ITU-R International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) 2030
framework for 6G. ISAC is envisioned to introduce the sensing capability into
the cellular network, where sensing may be obtained using the cellular radio
frequency (RF) signals with or without additional auxiliary sensors. To enable
ISAC, specification bodies such as European Telecommunications Standards
Institute (ETSI) and Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) have already
started to look into detailed ISAC use cases, their requirements, and the
channel models and evaluation methodologies that are necessary to design and
evaluate ISAC performance. With focus on the channel model, the current
communication-centric channel models like those specified in 3GPP technical
report (TR) 38.901 do not cover the RF signals interactions between the
transmitter, target object, receiver and their surrounding environment. To
bridge this gap, 3GPP has been looking into the basic changes that are
necessary to make to their TR38.901 channel model with focus on selected use
cases from the 3GPP SA1 5G-Advanced feasibility study. In parallel, ETSI ISAC
Industry Specification Group (ISG) has been studying the more advanced ISAC
channel modelling features that are needed to support the variety of ISAC use
cases envisioned in 6G. In this paper, we present the baseline and advanced
features developed thus far in 3GPP and ETSI ISAC ISG, respectively, towards a
comprehensive view of the ISAC channel model in 6G.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: RAA是一种新型多天线架构，通过低成本天线元件和少量射频链实现高性能，特别适用于低空无人机群ISAC系统，显著提升了感知角度分辨率和通信频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RAA架构以解决传统天线阵列在低空无人机群ISAC中因目标高机动性导致的通信和感知性能下降问题，同时降低成本并提升性能。

Method: 建立了RAA的数学模型，设计了RAA方向和RSN，研究了基于OFDM的RAA-ISAC系统，并提出高效的目标参数估计算法。

Result: 仿真结果表明RAA系统在感知角度分辨率和通信频谱效率上显著优于传统天线阵列。

Conclusion: RAA系统在低空无人机群ISAC中展现出巨大潜力，能够满足日益增长的需求。

Abstract: Ray antenna array (RAA) is a novel multi-antenna architecture comprising
massive low-cost antenna elements and a few radio-frequency (RF) chains. The
antenna elements are arranged in a novel ray-like structure, where each ray
corresponds to a simple uniform linear array (sULA) with deliberately designed
orientation and all its antenna elements are directly connected. By further
designing a ray selection network (RSN), appropriate sULAs are selected to
connect to the RF chains for further baseband processing. RAA has three
appealing advantages: (i) dramatically reduced hardware cost since no phase
shifters are needed; (ii) enhanced beamforming gain as antenna elements with
higher directivity can be used; (iii) uniform angular resolution across all
signal directions. Such benefits make RAA especially appealing for integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC), particularly for low-altitude unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) swarm ISAC, where high-mobility aerial targets may easily move
away from the boresight of conventional antenna arrays, causing severe
communication and sensing performance degradation. Therefore, this paper
studies RAA-based ISAC for low-altitude UAV swarm systems. First, we establish
an input-output mathematical model for RAA-based UAV ISAC and rigorously show
that RAA achieves uniform angular resolution for all directions. Besides, we
design the RAA orientation and RSN. Furthermore, RAA-based ISAC with orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for UAV swarm is studied, and efficient
algorithm is proposed for sensing target parameter estimation. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate the significant performance improvement by RAA
system over the conventional antenna arrays, in terms of sensing angular
resolution and communication spectral efficiency, highlighting the great
potential of the novel RAA system to meet the growing demands of low-altitude
UAV ISAC.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了模拟自干扰消除（A-SIC）在实践系统中的性能极限，针对多抽头延迟架构，分析了非平稳性、非线性失真、多径信道和抽头权重约束等实际因素，提出了性能分析和优化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模拟自干扰消除（A-SIC）在多抽头延迟架构中的性能极限，解决实际中的信号非平稳性、非线性失真等问题。

Method: 采用多抽头延迟（MTD）架构，分析非平稳发射信号、非线性失真、多径SI信道及抽头权重约束，提出优化框架和算法。

Result: 1）循环平稳发射信号的平均近似误差与平稳高斯过程相同；2）多径SI信道的近似误差可分解为单径误差之和。

Conclusion: 通过结构化的分析和优化，论文确立了A-SIC的实际性能极限，为实践提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Analog self-interference cancellation (A-SIC) plays a crucial role in the
implementation of in-band full-duplex (IBFD) radios, due to the fact that the
inherent transmit (Tx) noise can only be addressed in the analog domain. It is
thus natural to ask what the performance limit of A-SIC is in practical
systems, which is still quite underexplored so far. In this paper, we aim to
close this gap by characterizing the fundamental performance of A-SIC which
employs the common multi-tap delay (MTD) architecture, by accounting for the
following practical issues: 1) Nonstationarity of the Tx signal; 2) Nonlinear
distortions on the Tx signal; 3) Multipath channel corresponding to the
self-interference (SI); 4) Maximum amplitude constraint on the MTD tap weights.
Our findings include: 1) The average approximation error for the
cyclostationary Tx signals is equal to that for the stationary white Gaussian
process, thus greatly simplifying the performance analysis and the optimization
procedure. 2) The approximation error for the multipath SI channel can be
decomposed as the sum of the approximation error for the single-path scenario.
By leveraging these structural results, the optimization framework and
algorithms which characterize the fundamental limit of A-SIC, by taking into
account all the aforementioned practical factors, are provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的主动噪声控制技术在空间选择性上存在局限，尤其在保留特定方向声音的同时抑制噪声方面效果不足。

Method: 采用非因果相对脉冲响应优化，结合开耳式耳机在无回声环境中模拟局部化语音和噪声源。

Result: 非因果优化在所有指标（语音失真、噪声降低、信噪比提升）和场景中均优于因果方法，尤其在刻画期望声源响应方面更有效。

Conclusion: 非因果优化为空间选择性主动噪声控制提供了显著性能提升，尤其适用于开耳式设备。

Abstract: Recent advances in active noise control have enabled the development of
hearables with spatial selectivity, which actively suppress undesired noise
while preserving desired sound from specific directions. In this work, we
propose an improved approach to spatially selective active noise control that
incorporates acausal relative impulse responses into the optimization process,
resulting in significantly improved performance over the causal design. We
evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables
with spatially localized speech and noise sources in an anechoic environment.
Performance is evaluated in terms of speech distortion, noise reduction, and
signal-to-noise ratio improvement across different delays and degrees of
acausality. Results show that the proposed acausal optimization consistently
outperforms the causal approach across all metrics and scenarios, as acausal
filters more effectively characterize the response of the desired source.

Abstract: Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual
viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track
two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera
orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents
AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve
visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system
uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines
heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust
camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained
99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$
2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally
efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study
(N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training
task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's
viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's
improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary
camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side
manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new
multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Whitened Score (WS)扩散模型的新方法，避免了传统扩散模型在训练过程中需要反转协方差矩阵的问题，从而能够稳定地在任意高斯前向噪声过程中训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于分数的扩散模型在处理各向异性高斯扩散过程时，由于需要反转协方差矩阵而可能遇到困难。为了克服这一问题，论文提出了一种新的方法。

Method: 论文提出了Whitened Score (WS)扩散模型，通过学习白化分数函数而非标准分数函数，避免了协方差矩阵的反转，从而扩展了基于分数的扩散模型的应用范围。

Result: 实验通过在CIFAR和CelebA数据集上的多种计算成像任务验证，WS扩散模型在各向异性高斯噪声过程中训练的效果优于基于各向同性高斯噪声的传统扩散模型。

Conclusion: Whitened Score扩散模型通过避免协方差矩阵反转，不仅能够稳定训练，还能在不同高斯噪声分布下提供更好的性能，特别适用于具有结构化噪声的成像逆问题。

Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance
matrices in the denoising score matching training objective
\cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion
models, a novel SDE-based framework that learns the Whitened Score function
instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion,
extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary
Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with FM for
arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and
provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured
noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the
CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion
priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently
outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了RI-WuR-UAC协议，通过接收方发起的唤醒无线电（WuR）和无人机辅助的集群技术，解决无人机协助的物联网网络中高流量负载下WuR性能下降的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 在无人机协助的WuR物联网网络中，众多传感器节点（SNs）对唤醒呼叫（WuC）的自发响应会导致丢包和碰撞，WuR在高流量负载下无法展现优势，因此需要一种低延迟、高可靠性的解决方案。

Method: 提出RI-WuR-UAC MAC协议，建模为M/G/1/2排队框架，并推导关键性能指标。根据网络流量情况采用三种不同的数据流模型和MAC机制：轻负载的CCA集群、密集和重负载的回退加CCA集群、以及可变负载的自适应集群。

Conclusion: RI-WuR-UAC协议通过灵活的集群策略解决了高流量下WuR的局限性，同时实现了低延迟和低能耗的目标。

Abstract: In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wake-up radio (WuR)-enabled
internet of things (IoT) networks, UAVs can instantly activate the main radios
(MRs) of the sensor nodes (SNs) with a wake-up call (WuC) for efficient data
collection in mission-driven data collection scenarios. However, the
spontaneous response of numerous SNs to the UAV's WuC can lead to significant
packet loss and collisions, as WuR does not exhibit its superiority for
high-traffic loads. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative
receiver-initiated WuR UAV-assisted clustering (RI-WuR-UAC) medium access
control (MAC) protocol to achieve low latency and high reliability in ultra-low
power consumption applications. We model the proposed protocol using the
$M/G/1/2$ queuing framework and derive expressions for key performance metrics,
i.e., channel busyness probability, probability of successful clustering,
average SN energy consumption, and average transmission delay. The RI-WuR-UAC
protocol employs three distinct data flow models, tailored to different network
traffic conditions, which perform three MAC mechanisms: channel assessment
(CCA) clustering for light traffic loads, backoff plus CCA clustering for dense
and heavy traffic, and adaptive clustering for variable traffic loads.
Simulation results demonstrate that the RI-WuR-UAC protocol significantly
outperforms the benchmark sub-carrier modulation clustering protocol. By
varying the network load, we capture the trade-offs among the performance
metrics, showcasing the superior efficiency and reliability of the RI-WuR-UAC
protocol.

Motivation: 为了克服毫米波传播的高路径损耗并降低大规模多输入多输出（MIMO）天线系统的硬件成本，全维度混合波束成形在5G及更高版本的无线通信中至关重要。

Method: 利用基本的Kronecker分解和动态因子分配设计高效的混合波束成形器，其中模拟波束成形器用于消除小区间干扰并增强期望信号，数字波束成形器则基于最小均方误差准则降低小区内干扰，并开发了一种低复杂度混合波束成形器以降低调整速度。

Abstract: To circumvent the high path loss of mmWave propagation and reduce the
hardware cost of massive multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems,
full-dimensional hybrid beamforming is critical in 5G and beyond wireless
communications. Concerning an uplink multi-cell system with a large-scale
uniform planar antenna array, this paper designs an efficient hybrid beamformer
using primitive Kronecker decomposition and dynamic factor allocation, where
the analog beamformer applies to null the inter-cell interference and
simultaneously enhances the desired signals. In contrast, the digital
beamformer mitigates the intra-cell interference using the minimum mean square
error (MMSE) criterion. Then, due to the low accuracy of phase shifters
inherent in the analog beamformer, a low-complexity hybrid beamformer is
developed to slow its adjustment speed. Next, an optimality analysis from a
subspace perspective is performed, and a sufficient condition for optimal
antenna configuration is established. Finally, simulation results demonstrate
that the achievable sum rate of the proposed beamformer approaches that of the
optimal pure digital MMSE scheme, yet with much lower computational complexity
and hardware cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的最可靠独立位置（MRIP）框架，通过级联编码和软输入软输出（SISO）解码器的对数似然比（LLR）进一步限制搜索空间，以提高解码效率。实验证明，该方法在(128,36)二进制线性分组码上比传统eBCH码更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的有序统计解码（OSD）和A*解码虽然能利用接收符号的幅度建立MRIP框架，但对于低码率、大最小距离的码，搜索空间仍然巨大。因此，需要更高效的方法来限制搜索空间。

Method: 通过级联编码和改进的MRIP框架，利用SISO解码器对内部码的LLR值来确定MRIP框架，从而进一步缩小搜索空间。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所构建的级联码比(128,36) eBCH码更高效，且在长度为128或接近128的其他码上也表现了良好的效率。

Conclusion: 提出的改进MRIP框架和级联编码方法显著降低了解码复杂度，同时保持了较高的解码性能，适用于低码率、大最小距离的码。

Abstract: To decode a short linear block code, ordered statics decoding (OSD) and/or
the $A^*$ decoding are usually considered. Either OSD or the $A^*$ decoding
utilizes the magnitudes of the received symbols to establish the most reliable
and independent positions (MRIP) frame. A restricted searched space can be
employed to achieve near-optimum decoding with reduced decoding complexity. For
a low-rate code with large minimum distance, the restricted search space is
still very huge.
  We propose to use concatenated coding to further restrict the search space by
proposing an improved MRIP frame. The improved MRIP frame is founded according
to magnitudes of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) obtained by the soft-in soft-out
(SISO) decoder for the inner code.
  We focus on the construction and decoding of several $(n,k)$ = (128,36)
binary linear block codes based on concatenated coding. We use the (128,36)
extended BCH (eBCH) code as a benchmark for comparison. Simulation shows that
there exist constructed concatenated codes which are much more efficient than
the (128,36) eBCH code. Some other codes of length 128 or close to 128 are also
constructed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: Many multi-variate time series obtained in the natural sciences and
engineering possess a repetitive behavior, as for instance state-space
trajectories of industrial machines in discrete automation. Recovering the
times of recurrence from such a multi-variate time series is of a fundamental
importance for many monitoring and control tasks. For a periodic time series
this is equivalent to determining its period length. In this work we present a
persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate
time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic,
repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods
within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using
real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding
machine.

Abstract: Graph learning, or network inference, is a prominent problem in graph signal
processing (GSP). GSP generalizes the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean
domains, and graph learning is pivotal to applying GSP when these domains are
unknown. With the recent prevalence of multi-way data, there has been growing
interest in product graphs that naturally factorize dependencies across
different ways. However, the types of graph products that can be learned are
still limited for modeling diverse dependency structures. In this paper, we
study the problem of learning a Kronecker-structured product graph from smooth
signals. Unlike the more commonly used Cartesian product, the Kronecker product
models dependencies in a more intricate, non-separable way, but posits harder
constraints on the graph learning problem. To tackle this non-convex problem,
we propose an alternating scheme to optimize each factor graph and provide
theoretical guarantees for its asymptotic convergence. The proposed algorithm
is also modified to learn factor graphs of the strong product. We conduct
experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate our approach's
efficacy and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Designing a 6G-oriented universal model capable of processing multi-modal
data and executing diverse air interface tasks has emerged as a common goal in
future wireless systems. Building on our prior work in communication
multi-modal alignment and telecom large language model (LLM), we propose a
scalable, task-aware artificial intelligence-air interface multi-modal
universal model (AI2MMUM), which flexibility and effectively perform various
physical layer tasks according to subtle task instructions. The LLM backbone
provides robust contextual comprehension and generalization capabilities, while
a fine-tuning approach is adopted to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To
enhance task adaptability, task instructions consist of fixed task keywords and
learnable, implicit prefix prompts. Frozen radio modality encoders extract
universal representations and adapter layers subsequently bridge radio and
language modalities. Moreover, lightweight task-specific heads are designed to
directly output task objectives. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that
AI2MMUM achieves SOTA performance across five representative physical
environment/wireless channel-based downstream tasks using the WAIR-D and
DeepMIMO datasets.
