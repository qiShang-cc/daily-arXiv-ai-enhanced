Our study explores\ntwo distinct uncertainty sets for the INC matrix and three for the steering\nvector. The uncertainty sets of the INC matrix account for the support and the\npositive semidefinite (PSD) mean of the distribution, as well as a similarity\nconstraint on the mean. The uncertainty sets for the steering vector consist of\nthe constraints on the first- and second-order moments of its associated\nprobability distribution. The RAB problem is formulated as the minimization of\nthe worst-case expected value of the SINR denominator over any distribution\nwithin the uncertainty set of the INC matrix, subject to the condition that the\nexpected value of the numerator is greater than or equal to one for every\ndistribution within the uncertainty set of the steering vector. By leveraging\nthe strong duality of linear conic programming, this RAB problem is\nreformulated as a quadratic matrix inequality problem. Subsequently, it is\naddressed by iteratively solving a sequence of linear matrix inequality\nrelaxation problems, incorporating a penalty term for the rank-one PSD matrix\nconstraint. We further analyze the convergence of the iterative algorithm. The\nproposed robust beamforming approach is validated through simulation examples,\nwhich illustrate improved performance in terms of the array output SINR."}

Traditional spectrum\ncartography methods have limitations in handling the temporal and spatial\ncomplexities inherent to these networks. Addressing these challenges, the\nproposed framework first employs a Reconstructive Masked Autoencoder (RecMAE)\ncapable of accurately reconstructing spectrum maps from sparse and temporally\nvarying sensor data using a novel dual-mask mechanism. This approach\nsignificantly enhances the precision of reconstructed radio frequency (RF)\npower maps.

While\neffective for pristine videos, FRMs drive codecs to preserve artifacts when the\ninput is degraded, resulting in suboptimal compression. A more suitable\napproach used to assess UGC quality is based on non-reference metrics (NRMs).\nHowever, RDO with NRMs as a measure of distortion requires an iterative\nworkflow of encoding, decoding, and metric evaluation, which is computationally\nimpractical. This paper overcomes this limitation by linearizing the NRM around\nthe uncompressed video. The resulting cost function enables block-wise bit\nallocation in the transform domain by estimating the alignment of the\nquantization error with the gradient of the NRM. To avoid large deviations from\nthe input, we add sum of squared errors (SSE) regularization.
