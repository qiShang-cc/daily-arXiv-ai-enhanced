Because these vital services require\nuninterrupted operation, their resilience to unforeseen disruptions is\nessential. However, implementing resilience necessitates rapid recovery\nprocedures, which operate in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, where short\npackets and added error-correction overhead can severely degrade communication\nefficiency. Due to this performance loss, always attempting recovery can\nbackfire and result in worse outcomes than simply enduring the disruption under\nlonger blocklengths. In this work, we study these effects of FBL constraints\nwithin a resilience framework, incorporating reconfigurable intelligent\nsurfaces (RIS) to enhance adaptation capabilities. By actively shaping the\nwireless environment, RIS help counteract some of the performance losses caused\nby FBL, enabling more effective recovery from disruptions. Numerical results\nreveal two critical blocklength thresholds: the first enables full recovery\nfrom the FBL penalty, while the second, at a higher blocklength, allows the\nsystem to recover from both the FBL penalty and the initial disruption,\nyielding a significant improvement in resilience performance. Additionally, we\nshow that the number of RIS elements shifts these thresholds, enabling faster\nreconfiguration with shorter blocklengths and providing insights to the\ntrade-offs between rate, blocklength, and reconfiguration effort under FBL\nconditions."}

To tackle this\nissue, in this paper, we explore integrating RIS-user equipment (UE)\nassociation into downlink RIS-assisted CF transmitter design, which greatly\nreduces the channel acquisition costs. The key point is that once UEs are\nassociated with specific RISs, there is no need to frequently acquire channels\nfrom non-associated RISs. Then, we formulate the problem of joint RIS-UE\nassociation and beamforming at APs and RISs to maximize the weighted sum rate\n(WSR). In particular, we propose a two-stage framework to solve it. In the\nfirst stage, we apply a many-to-many matching algorithm to establish the RIS-UE\nassociation.

Most\nexisting MP-SLAM methods assume that map features and their corresponding RF\npropagation paths are statistically independent, which neglects inherent\ndependencies arising when a single reflective surface contributes to different\npropagation paths or when an agent communicates with more than one base\nstation. Previous approaches that aim to fuse information across propagation\npaths are limited by their inability to perform ray tracing in environments\nwith nonconvex geometries.

This paper introduces a novel\nnetworking paradigm, termed heterogeneous massive MIMO (HmMIMO), which\nseamlessly integrates co-located and distributed antennas. Differing from two\nconventional paradigms, HmMIMO remains a base station with a large antenna\narray at the center of each cell, aided by distributed antennas deployed at\ncell edges. Our findings demonstrate that this paradigm achieves a favorable\ntrade-off between performance and implementation complexity."}

However, the\nincreasing number of devices communicating on the same channels will lead to\nsignificant channel load. To address this issue this study evaluates the\neffectiveness of Redundancy Mitigation (RM) for VRU Awareness Messages (VAM),\nfocusing specifically on cyclists. The objective of RM is to minimize the\ntransmission of redundant information. We conducted a simulation study using a\nurban scenario with a high bicycle density based on traffic data from Hannover,\nGermany. This study assessed the impact of RM on channel load, measured by\nChannel Busy Ratio (CBR), and safety, measured by VRU Perception Rate (VPR) in\nsimulation. To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the RM mechanisms, we\nanalyzed the actual differences in position, speed, and heading between the ego\nVRU and the VRU, which was assumed to be redundant. Our findings indicate that\nwhile RM can reduce channel congestion, it also leads to a decrease in VPR. The\nanalysis of actual differences revealed that the RM mechanism standardized by\nETSI often uses outdated information, leading to significant discrepancies in\nposition, speed, and heading, which could result in dangerous situations. To\naddress these limitations, we propose an adapted RM mechanism that improves the\nbalance between reducing channel load and maintaining VRU awareness. The\nadapted approach shows a significant reduction in maximum CBR and a less\nsignificant decrease in VPR compared to the standardized RM. Moreover, it\ndemonstrates better performance in the actual differences in position, speed,\nand heading, thereby enhancing overall safety. Our results highlight the need\nfor further research to optimize RM techniques and ensure they effectively\nenhance V2X communication without compromising the safety of VRUs."}

However, training ONNs poses unique challenges, notably the\nreliance on simplified in silico models whose trained parameters must\nsubsequently be mapped to physical hardware. This process often introduces\ninaccuracies due to discrepancies between the idealized digital model and the\nphysical ONN implementation, particularly stemming from noise and fabrication\nimperfections.\n  In this paper, we analyze how noise misspecification during in silico\ntraining impacts ONN performance and we introduce Gradient-Informed Fine-Tuning\n(GIFT), a lightweight algorithm designed to mitigate this performance\ndegradation. GIFT uses gradient information derived from the noise structure of\nthe ONN to adapt pretrained parameters directly in situ, without requiring\nexpensive retraining or complex experimental setups. GIFT comes with formal\nconditions under which it improves ONN performance.\n  We also demonstrate the effectiveness of GIFT via simulation on a five-layer\nfeed forward ONN trained on the MNIST digit classification task. GIFT achieves\nup to $28\\%$ relative accuracy improvement compared to the baseline performance\nunder noise misspecification, without resorting to costly retraining. Overall,\nGIFT provides a practical solution for bridging the gap between simplified\ndigital models and real-world ONN implementations."}

DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types,\ntasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and\nclassification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning\naccelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts\nstorage by 42%, with a minimal impact on model performance.

The classic method relies on multiple\nexposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging\ndynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR\ndata into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many\nestablished methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image\ndetail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize\nthe global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR\nshutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the\nsensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the\nsensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.\nThe exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization\nproblem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many\nsensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest\nsaturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an\noff-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle\nis coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our\nprototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with\n48dB dynamic range."}
