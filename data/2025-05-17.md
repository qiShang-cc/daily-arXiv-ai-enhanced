### [1] [Efficient Near-Field Beam Focusing Merging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit and CVX for Large Intelligent Surface Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09711)
*Jiawang Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效近场波束形成方法，利用正交匹配追踪（OMP）和坐标镜像对称技术减少计算复杂度，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为避免传统凸优化方法在大规模阵列中的高计算成本，提出一种更高效的方法支持6G网络中的大规模智能表面部署。

Method: 分两步：先用OMP方法预选稀疏目标位置并应用坐标镜像对称技术降低复杂度；再用凸优化基于预选阵列求解，直到满足预定义阈值。

Result: 与传统方法相比，效率提升显著：121元素阵列提升15.12倍，441元素阵列提升96.73倍。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅性能优越，还具有在大规模近场阵列系统中作为波束聚焦技术的巨大潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, an efficient near-field beamforming method is proposed to
support the large intelligent surfaces (LIS) that are expected to be widely
deployed in 6G networks. This approach avoids directly applying convex (CVX)
optimization for sparse selection in large-size array matrices, as such methods
often lead to excessive computational time due to blind searching to satisfy a
series of objective functions. First, based on the objective function, we
prioritize a key component and employ the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)
method to pre-select potential sparse target positions. To ensure focal
symmetry, a coordinate mirror symmetry approach is adopted, meaning that
selection is performed only in the first quadrant, while the remaining
quadrants are determined through mirror symmetry relative to the first
quadrant. This significantly reduces computational complexity at an early
stage. Next, CVX is applied based on the pre-selected sparse array. Once a
predefined threshold is met, a solution is obtained that satisfies the
constraints of the beamfocusing. The results demonstrate that, compared with
conventional methods, this approach improves efficiency by 15.12 times with 121
elements and 96.73 times with 441 elements. The proposed method demonstrates
not only satisfactory performance but also considerable potential as a beam
focusing technique for large-scale near-field array systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出FAS-LLM，一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的新型架构，用于预测OTFS卫星下行链路中的未来信道状态。通过两阶段信道压缩策略和LoRA适应的LLM，实现了高效的时间序列预测，性能显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决OTFS卫星下行链路中信道状态预测的挑战，尤其是高维度和延迟敏感性问题，研究提出了一种基于LLM的高效预测方法。

Method: 采用两阶段信道压缩策略（参考端口选择和可分离PCA）提取紧凑的信道表示，并嵌入到LoRA适应的LLM中进行时间序列预测。

Result: FAS-LLM在NMSE和RMSE上优于GRU、LSTM和Transformer，最高提升10 dB和降低3倍RMSE。预测信道保留了物理层特性，在不同SNR下实现了接近最优的性能。

Conclusion: LLM-based forecasting在延迟敏感和节能的卫星物联网链路适应中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes FAS-LLM, a novel large language model (LLM)-based
architecture for predicting future channel states in Orthogonal Time Frequency
Space (OTFS)-enabled satellite downlinks equipped with fluid antenna systems
(FAS). The proposed method introduces a two-stage channel compression strategy
combining reference-port selection and separable principal component analysis
(PCA) to extract compact, delay-Doppler-aware representations from
high-dimensional OTFS channels. These representations are then embedded into a
LoRA-adapted LLM, enabling efficient time-series forecasting of channel
coefficients. Performance evaluations demonstrate that FAS-LLM outperforms
classical baselines including GRU, LSTM, and Transformer models, achieving up
to 10 dB normalized mean squared error (NMSE) improvement and threefold root
mean squared error (RMSE) reduction across prediction horizons. Furthermore,
the predicted channels preserve key physical-layer characteristics, enabling
near-optimal performance in ergodic capacity, spectral efficiency, and outage
probability across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). These results
highlight the potential of LLM-based forecasting for delay-sensitive and
energy-efficient link adaptation in future satellite IoT networks.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided terahertz (THz)-band
communications are promising enablers for future wireless networks. However,
array densification at high frequencies introduces significant challenges in
accurate channel modeling and estimation, particularly with THz-specific
fading, mutual coupling (MC), spatial correlation, and near-field effects. In
this work, we model THz outdoor small-scale fading channels using the mixture
gamma (MG) distribution, considering absorption losses, spherical wave
propagation, MC, and spatial correlation across large base stations and RISs.
We derive the distribution of the cascaded RIS-aided channel and investigate
linear channel estimation techniques, analyzing the impact of various channel
parameters. Numerical results based on precise THz parameters reveal that
accounting for spatial correlation, MC, and near-field modeling substantially
enhances estimation accuracy, especially in ultra-massive arrays and
short-range scenarios. These results underscore the importance of incorporating
these effects for precise, physically consistent channel modeling.

### [4] [Implicit Neural Representation of Waveform Measurements in Power Systems Waveform Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09789)
*Narges Ehsani,Vishwanath Saragadam,Hamed Mohsenian-Rad*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的新方法，用于电力系统中的波形分析，通过设计适合电力系统波形特性的模型（如使用正弦激活函数），实现了高精度（<1-2% MSE）和高效压缩（4-6倍）。

Conclusion: INR模型为电力系统波形分析提供了高效且高精度的解决方案，展示了其在多种监测场景中的潜力。

Abstract: There is currently a paradigm shift in several power system monitoring
applications, such as incipient fault detection and monitoring inverter-based
resources, to transition from traditional phasor analytics to more informative
waveform analytics. This paper contributes to this transition by developing a
novel approach to modeling voltage and current waveform measurements using
implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs are continuous function
approximators that are recently used in vision and signal processing. The
proposed INR models are specifically designed to meet the requirements of
waveform analytics in power systems, such as by using sinusoidal activation
functions that capture the periodic nature of voltage and current waveforms. We
also propose extended models that can efficiently represent correlated
waveforms, such as three-phase waveforms and synchro-waveforms. Real-world case
studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed INR models in terms of
accuracy (<1-2% MSE) and model size (4-6x compression). We also investigate the
application of INR models in oscillation monitoring, for single mode
oscillations and dual mode modulated oscillations.

Result: 结果

Conclusion: 结论

Abstract: Conformal phased arrays promise shape-changing properties, multiple degrees
of freedom to the scan angle, and novel applications in wearables, aerospace,
defense, vehicles, and ships. However, they have suffered from two critical
limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication
and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic
deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic
Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip
real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2)
Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility,
but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based
on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance
and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper
Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with < 0.1% variation per degree C with
temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using
the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation
correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable
due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星通信在非地面网络（NTNs）中的重要性日益增加，需要研究多层异构卫星网络中的用户关联策略以优化系统性能。

Method: 使用随机几何分析两种用户关联策略（最近卫星和最大信干噪比卫星），并推导覆盖概率、非切换概率和时延中断概率的显式表达式。

Result: 通过蒙特卡罗仿真验证了理论框架的鲁棒性，发现不同场景下存在最优用户关联策略。

Conclusion: 加权度量为系统设计提供了性能权衡的工具，验证了理论分析的准确性。

Abstract: In the rapid evolution of the non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), satellite
communication has emerged as a focal area of research due to its critical role
in enabling seamless global connectivity. In this paper, we investigate two
representative user association policies (UAPs) for multi-tier heterogeneous
satellite networks (HetSatNets), namely the nearest satellite UAP and the
maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (max-SINR) satellite UAP, where
each tier is characterized by a distinct constellation configuration and
transmission pattern. Employing stochastic geometric, we analyze various
intermediate system aspects, including the probability of a typical user
accessing each satellite tier, the aggregated interference power, and their
corresponding Laplace transforms (LTs) under both UAPs. Subsequently, we derive
explicit expressions for coverage probability (CP), non-handover probability
(NHP), and time delay outage probability (DOP) of the typical user.
Furthermore, we propose a novel weighted metric (WM) that integrates CP, NHP,
and DOP to explore their trade-offs in the system design. The robustness of the
theoretical framework is verified is verified through Monte Carlo simulations
calibrated with the actual Starlink constellation, affirming the precision of
our analytical approach. The empirical findings underscore an optimal UAP in
various HetSatNet scenarios regarding CP, NHP, and DOP..

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 多模态感知辅助通信框架在感知预算下动态调整感知与波束成形，优化信号噪声比，同时减少感知次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多模态感知数据可提升通信系统性能，但高计算复杂度和连续感知导致功耗和带宽问题，需权衡感知数据获取速率与通信性能。

Method: 提出约束性多模态感知辅助通信框架，在感知预算下动态调整感知与波束成形，并通过Lyapunov优化解决问题。基于位置信息构建信道模型。

Result: 数值评估显示，减少一半感知次数仅导致平均信噪比最多下降7.7%。

Conclusion: 动态感知与波束成形算法有效平衡感知数据获取与通信性能，在有限资源下实现高效通信。

Abstract: Using multimodal sensory data can enhance communications systems by reducing
the overhead and latency in beam training. However, processing such data incurs
high computational complexity, and continuous sensing results in significant
power and bandwidth consumption. This gives rise to a tradeoff between the
(multimodal) sensing data acquisition rate and communications performance. In
this work, we develop a constrained multimodal sensing-aided communications
framework where dynamic sensing and beamforming are performed under a sensing
budget. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the
average received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of user equipment, subject to
constraints on the average number of sensing actions and power budget. Using
the Saleh-Valenzuela mmWave channel model, we construct the channel primarily
based on position information obtained via multimodal sensing. Stricter sensing
constraints reduce the availability of position data, leading to degraded
channel estimation and thus lower performance. We apply Lyapunov optimization
to solve the problem and derive a dynamic sensing and beamforming algorithm.
Numerical evaluations on the DeepSense and Raymobtime datasets show that
halving sensing times leads to only up to 7.7% loss in average SNR.

Conclusion: MIMO配置显著提升了近场传感性能，理论推导验证了数值结果，为下一代无线通信系统设计提供了依据。

Abstract: The radiative near-field and integration of sensing capabilities are seen as
two key components of the next generation of wireless communication systems. In
this paper, the sensing performance of a narrowband near-field system is
investigated for several practical antenna array geometries and configurations,
namely SIMO/MISO and MIMO. In the SIMO/MISO configuration, the antenna aperture
is exploited only a single time for either transmit or receive signal
processing, while the MIMO configuration exploits both TX and RX processing.
Analytical derivations, supported by simulations, show that the MIMO processing
improves the maximum near-field range and sensing resolution by approximately a
factor of 1.4 as compared to single-aperture systems. The value of the
improvement factor is consistent for all considered array geometries. Finally,
using a quadratic approximation of the array factor, an analytical improvement
factor of $\sqrt{2}$ is derived, clarifying the observed improvements and
validating the numerical results.

*Borja Genoves Guzman,Maximo Morales-Cespedes,Ana Garcia Armada,Maite Brandt-Pearce*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在可见光通信(VLC)中结合使用角度分集接收器(ADR)和光学可重构智能表面(ORIS)来解决链路阻塞问题，并提出了一种优化算法以最大化信噪比(SNR)。结果显示，ADR与ORIS的集成显著提升了VLC性能，SNR增益高达30 dB，并减少了通信中断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无线数据需求的增长，VLC成为一种有前景的解决方案，但链路阻塞问题仍是主要挑战。

Method: 通过结合ADR和ORIS（小型可移动镜子），提出优化算法以最大化最小SNR，确保公平通信网络。

Result: 集成ADR和ORIS显著提升了VLC性能，SNR增益达30 dB，有效减少了因链路阻塞或接收信号超出视场角导致的通信中断。

Conclusion: ADR与ORIS的结合有效解决了VLC中的链路阻塞问题，并且单个层级的ADR已足够与ORIS辅助的VLC协同工作。

Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) offers a promising solution to satisfy the
increasing demand for wireless data. However, link blockages remain a
significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by investigating the
combined use of angle diversity receivers (ADRs) and optical reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (ORISs) in multiuser VLC systems. We consider ORIS
elements as small movable mirrors. We demonstrate the complementarity of ADR
and ORIS in mitigating link blockages, as well as the advantages of using a
larger number of ORIS elements due to the increased field-of-view (FoV) at the
receiver enabled by the ADR. An optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize
the minimum signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) to deploy a fair communication
network. Numerical results show that integrating ADR and ORIS significantly
enhances VLC communication performance, achieving an SNR gain of up to 30 dB
compared to a system without ORIS, and mitigating communication outages
produced by link blockages or out-of-FoV received signals. We also prove that
an ADR with a single tier of photodiodes is sufficient to complement
ORIS-assisted VLC.

*Guangjin Pan,Kaixuan Huang,Hui Chen,Shunqing Zhang,Christian Häger,Henk Wymeersch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于基础模型的无线定位方法（LWLM），通过自监督学习联合优化三个互补目标，显著提升了定位精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动方法在无线定位中需要大量标注数据且难以泛化的问题，以支持5G/6G应用如自动驾驶和智能制造的精准定位需求。

Method: 设计了一种自监督学习框架，联合优化空间频率掩码信道建模（SF-MCM）、域变换不变性（DTI）和位置不变对比学习（PICL），并结合轻量级解码器适应下游任务。

Result: 实验表明，LWLM在所有定位任务中均优于基于模型和监督学习的基线方法，尤其在没有预训练的Transformer模型上提升了26.0%--87.5%。

Conclusion: LWLM展示了作为无线定位基础模型的潜力，尤其在标签有限和未知基站配置下表现出强泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G
applications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart
manufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing
models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across
deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations,
we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless
localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL)
tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on
information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a
pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model
(LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three
complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling
(SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii)
position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly
capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple
perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks,
including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation,
single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization.
Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses
both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization
tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer
models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under
label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its
potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.

TL;DR: CFARNet提出了一种基于学习的处理框架，用CNN替代CFAR进行峰值检测，显著提升了毫米波雷达在低信噪比和多目标密集情况下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于CFAR的信号处理方法在检测多目标时存在局限性，尤其是在低发射功率和目标密集条件下。

Method: CFARNet采用卷积神经网络（CNN）替代CFAR检测器，通过预测目标子载波索引，结合已知的频率-角度映射进行角度估计，并使用MUSIC算法实现高分辨率距离和速度估计。

Result: 仿真表明，CFARNet在低发射功率和多目标密集条件下显著优于CFAR+MUSIC基准方法，具有更高的角度分辨率、更强的鲁棒性和更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的方法在高分辨率毫米波雷达感知中具有显著潜力，CFARNet为实时目标检测与跟踪提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) OFDM radar equipped with rainbow beamforming,
enabled by joint phase-time arrays (JPTAs), provides wide-angle coverage and is
well-suited for fast real-time target detection and tracking. However, accurate
detection of multiple closely spaced targets remains a key challenge for
conventional signal processing pipelines, particularly those relying on
constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors. This paper presents CFARNet, a
learning-based processing framework that replaces CFAR with a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for peak detection in the angle-Doppler domain. The
network predicts target subcarrier indices, which guide angle estimation via a
known frequency-angle mapping and enable high-resolution range and velocity
estimation using the MUSIC algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that
CFARNet significantly outperforms a CFAR+MUSIC baseline, especially under low
transmit power and dense multi-target conditions. The proposed method offers
superior angular resolution, enhanced robustness in low-SNR scenarios, and
improved computational efficiency, highlighting the potential of data-driven
approaches for high-resolution mmWave radar sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双静态感知系统因发射器和接收器时钟异步导致时变偏移，严重影响感知性能。现有方法难以解决这一问题，因此需要一种新框架来准确估计目标路径参数，以提升综合感知与通信系统（ISAC）的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了双静态感知中的时钟异步问题，实现了高精度参数估计和超分辨率延迟分析，为ISAC系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Bi-static sensing is an attractive configuration for integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) systems; however, clock asynchronism between widely
separated transmitters and receivers introduces time-varying time offsets (TO)
and phase offsets (PO), posing significant challenges. This paper introduces a
signal-subspace-based framework that estimates decoupled angles, delays, and
complex gain sequences (CGS)-- the target-reflected signals -- for multiple
dynamic target paths. The proposed framework begins with a novel TO alignment
algorithm, leveraging signal subspace or covariance, to mitigate TO variations
across temporal snapshots, enabling coherent delay-domain analysis.
Subsequently, subspace-based methods are developed to compensate for TO
residuals and to perform joint angle-delay estimation. Finally, leveraging the
high resolution in the joint angle-delay domain, the framework compensates for
the PO and estimates the CGS for each target. The framework can be applied to
both single-antenna and multi-antenna systems. Extensive simulations and
experiments using commercial Wi-Fi devices demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly surpasses existing solutions in parameter estimation
accuracy and delay resolution. Notably, it uniquely achieves a super-resolution
in the delay domain, with a probability-of-resolution curve tightly approaching
that in synchronized systems.

Abstract: The Pinching-Antenna SyStem (PASS) reconstructs wireless channels through
\emph{pinching beamforming}, wherein the activated positions of pinching
antennas along dielectric waveguides are optimized to shape the radiation
pattern. The aim of this article is to analyze the performance limits of
employing PASS in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Specifically, a
PASS-assisted ISAC system is considered, where a pinched waveguide is utilized
to simultaneously communicate with a user and sense a target. Closed-form
expressions for the achievable communication rate (CR) and sensing rate (SR)
are derived to characterize the information-theoretic limits of this
dual-functional operation. \romannumeral1) For the single-pinch case,
closed-form solutions for the optimal pinching antenna location are derived
under \emph{sensing-centric (S-C)}, \emph{communications-centric (C-C)}, and
\emph{Pareto-optimal} designs. On this basis, the CR-SR trade-off is
characterized by deriving the full CR-SR rate region, which is shown to
encompass that of conventional fixed-antenna systems. \romannumeral2) For the
multiple-pinch case, an antenna location refinement method is applied to obtain
the optimal C-C and S-C pinching beamformers. As a further advance, inner and
outer bounds on the achievable CR-SR region are derived using an element-wise
alternating optimization technique and by invoking Cauchy-Schwarz and
Karamata's inequalities, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate that:
\romannumeral1) the derived bounds closely approximate the true CR-SR region;
and \romannumeral2) PASS can achieve a significantly larger rate region than
conventional-antenna systems.

effort for data acquisition. The concept of channel charting reduces this
effort by modeling and projecting the manifold of \ac{csi} onto a 2D coordinate
space. So far, researchers only applied this concept to active radio
localization, where a mobile device intentionally and actively emits a specific
signal. In this paper, we apply channel charting to passive localization. We
use a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system to estimate a target's velocity
and derive a distance matrix from it. We then use this matrix to learn a
distance-preserving embedding in 2D space, which serves as a fingerprinting
model. In our experiments, we deploy six nodes in a fully connected
ultra-wideband (UWB) mesh network to show that our method achieves high
localization accuracy, with an average error of just 0.24\,m, even when we
train and test on different targets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用无人机搭载的智能反射面（IRS）和六维空间机动性的新型ISAC系统，通过联合优化优化传输波束成形、IRS的3D位置、朝向及反射系数，显著提高了传感与通信的性能权衡。

Motivation: 解决集成传感与通信（ISAC）系统中基本性能权衡的挑战，通过无人机（UAV）搭载智能反射面（IRS）和六维机动性，提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 被动6DMA支持的ISAC系统为提升传感与通信性能提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Improving the fundamental performance trade-off in integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) systems has been deemed as one of the most significant
challenges. To address it, we propose in this letter a novel ISAC system that
leverages an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS) and the UAV's maneuverability in six-dimensional (6D) space,
i.e., three-dimensional (3D) location and 3D rotation, thus referred to as
passive 6D movable antenna (6DMA). We aim to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) for sensing a single target while ensuring a minimum SNR at a
communication user equipment (UE), by jointly optimizing the transmit
beamforming at the ISAC base station (BS), the 3D location and orientation as
well as the reflection coefficients of the IRS. To solve this challenging
non-convex optimization problem, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first
stage, we aim to optimize the IRS's 3D location, 3D orientation, and reflection
coefficients to enhance both the channel correlations and power gains for
sensing and communication. Given their optimized parameters, the optimal
transmit beamforming at the ISAC BS is derived in closed form. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed passive 6DMA-enabled ISAC system
significantly improves the sensing and communication trade-off by
simultaneously enhancing channel correlations and power gains, and outperforms
other baseline schemes.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is defined as one of six usage
scenarios in the ITU-R International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) 2030
framework for 6G. ISAC is envisioned to introduce the sensing capability into
the cellular network, where sensing may be obtained using the cellular radio
frequency (RF) signals with or without additional auxiliary sensors. To enable
ISAC, specification bodies such as European Telecommunications Standards
Institute (ETSI) and Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) have already
started to look into detailed ISAC use cases, their requirements, and the
channel models and evaluation methodologies that are necessary to design and
evaluate ISAC performance. With focus on the channel model, the current
communication-centric channel models like those specified in 3GPP technical
report (TR) 38.901 do not cover the RF signals interactions between the
transmitter, target object, receiver and their surrounding environment. To
bridge this gap, 3GPP has been looking into the basic changes that are
necessary to make to their TR38.901 channel model with focus on selected use
cases from the 3GPP SA1 5G-Advanced feasibility study. In parallel, ETSI ISAC
Industry Specification Group (ISG) has been studying the more advanced ISAC
channel modelling features that are needed to support the variety of ISAC use
cases envisioned in 6G. In this paper, we present the baseline and advanced
features developed thus far in 3GPP and ETSI ISAC ISG, respectively, towards a
comprehensive view of the ISAC channel model in 6G.

TL;DR: 本文提出了新型射线天线阵列（RAA）架构，结合低成本天线单元与少量射频链，设计射线选择网络（RSN）优化连接，显著降低硬件成本并提升波束赋形增益和均匀角分辨率，适用于低空无人机群集成感知与通信（ISAC）场景。理论模型与仿真验证了其优于传统天线的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于低空无人机群的高机动性可能导致传统天线性能下降，研究新型RAA架构以实现低成本、高增益和均匀角分辨率的ISAC系统显得尤为重要。

Method: 通过设计射线状天线结构和RSN网络，结合OFDM技术，提出高效的感知目标参数估计算法。

Result: 仿真结果显示，RAA在角分辨率和通信频谱效率上显著优于传统天线阵列。

Conclusion: RAA系统展现了在低空无人机ISAC应用中的巨大潜力，能有效满足其日益增长的需求。

Abstract: Ray antenna array (RAA) is a novel multi-antenna architecture comprising
massive low-cost antenna elements and a few radio-frequency (RF) chains. The
antenna elements are arranged in a novel ray-like structure, where each ray
corresponds to a simple uniform linear array (sULA) with deliberately designed
orientation and all its antenna elements are directly connected. By further
designing a ray selection network (RSN), appropriate sULAs are selected to
connect to the RF chains for further baseband processing. RAA has three
appealing advantages: (i) dramatically reduced hardware cost since no phase
shifters are needed; (ii) enhanced beamforming gain as antenna elements with
higher directivity can be used; (iii) uniform angular resolution across all
signal directions. Such benefits make RAA especially appealing for integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC), particularly for low-altitude unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) swarm ISAC, where high-mobility aerial targets may easily move
away from the boresight of conventional antenna arrays, causing severe
communication and sensing performance degradation. Therefore, this paper
studies RAA-based ISAC for low-altitude UAV swarm systems. First, we establish
an input-output mathematical model for RAA-based UAV ISAC and rigorously show
that RAA achieves uniform angular resolution for all directions. Besides, we
design the RAA orientation and RSN. Furthermore, RAA-based ISAC with orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for UAV swarm is studied, and efficient
algorithm is proposed for sensing target parameter estimation. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate the significant performance improvement by RAA
system over the conventional antenna arrays, in terms of sensing angular
resolution and communication spectral efficiency, highlighting the great
potential of the novel RAA system to meet the growing demands of low-altitude
UAV ISAC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于带内全双工无线电中发射噪声只能在模拟域处理，研究A-SIC在实用系统中的性能极限是一个重要但尚未充分探索的问题。

Method: 论文采用多抽头延迟（MTD）架构，分析非平稳发射信号、非线性失真、多径信道和幅度约束等实际因素，并提出优化框架和算法。

Result: 研究发现，对于循环平稳发射信号的平均近似误差等同于白高斯过程，且多径信道误差可分解为单径误差之和，简化了性能分析和优化过程。

Conclusion: 通过结构分析和优化框架，论文为A-SIC在实际系统中的性能提供了理论基础和实现方法。

Abstract: Analog self-interference cancellation (A-SIC) plays a crucial role in the
implementation of in-band full-duplex (IBFD) radios, due to the fact that the
inherent transmit (Tx) noise can only be addressed in the analog domain. It is
thus natural to ask what the performance limit of A-SIC is in practical
systems, which is still quite underexplored so far. In this paper, we aim to
close this gap by characterizing the fundamental performance of A-SIC which
employs the common multi-tap delay (MTD) architecture, by accounting for the
following practical issues: 1) Nonstationarity of the Tx signal; 2) Nonlinear
distortions on the Tx signal; 3) Multipath channel corresponding to the
self-interference (SI); 4) Maximum amplitude constraint on the MTD tap weights.
Our findings include: 1) The average approximation error for the
cyclostationary Tx signals is equal to that for the stationary white Gaussian
process, thus greatly simplifying the performance analysis and the optimization
procedure. 2) The approximation error for the multipath SI channel can be
decomposed as the sum of the approximation error for the single-path scenario.
By leveraging these structural results, the optimization framework and
algorithms which characterize the fundamental limit of A-SIC, by taking into
account all the aforementioned practical factors, are provided.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating differences in two multi-attribute
Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) which are known to have similar structure,
using a penalized D-trace loss function with non-convex penalties. The GGM
structure is encoded in its precision (inverse covariance) matrix. Existing
methods for multi-attribute differential graph estimation are based on a group
lasso penalized loss function. In this paper, we consider a penalized D-trace
loss function with non-convex (log-sum and smoothly clipped absolute deviation
(SCAD)) penalties. Two proximal gradient descent methods are presented to
optimize the objective function. Theoretical analysis establishing sufficient
conditions for consistency in support recovery, convexity and estimation in
high-dimensional settings is provided. We illustrate our approaches with
numerical examples based on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: 非因果优化方法在空间选择性主动噪声控制中表现优异，为听戴设备提供了更高效的技术支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in active noise control have enabled the development of
hearables with spatial selectivity, which actively suppress undesired noise
while preserving desired sound from specific directions. In this work, we
propose an improved approach to spatially selective active noise control that
incorporates acausal relative impulse responses into the optimization process,
resulting in significantly improved performance over the causal design. We
evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables
with spatially localized speech and noise sources in an anechoic environment.
Performance is evaluated in terms of speech distortion, noise reduction, and
signal-to-noise ratio improvement across different delays and degrees of
acausality. Results show that the proposed acausal optimization consistently
outperforms the causal approach across all metrics and scenarios, as acausal
filters more effectively characterize the response of the desired source.

Conclusion: Kronecker乘积图能够更复杂地建模依赖结构，所提算法有效且性能优越，为多维图学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph learning, or network inference, is a prominent problem in graph signal
processing (GSP). GSP generalizes the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean
domains, and graph learning is pivotal to applying GSP when these domains are
unknown. With the recent prevalence of multi-way data, there has been growing
interest in product graphs that naturally factorize dependencies across
different ways. However, the types of graph products that can be learned are
still limited for modeling diverse dependency structures. In this paper, we
study the problem of learning a Kronecker-structured product graph from smooth
signals. Unlike the more commonly used Cartesian product, the Kronecker product
models dependencies in a more intricate, non-separable way, but posits harder
constraints on the graph learning problem. To tackle this non-convex problem,
we propose an alternating scheme to optimize each factor graph and provide
theoretical guarantees for its asymptotic convergence. The proposed algorithm
is also modified to learn factor graphs of the strong product. We conduct
experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate our approach's
efficacy and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Designing a 6G-oriented universal model capable of processing multi-modal

future wireless systems. Building on our prior work in communication
multi-modal alignment and telecom large language model (LLM), we propose a
scalable, task-aware artificial intelligence-air interface multi-modal
universal model (AI2MMUM), which flexibility and effectively perform various
physical layer tasks according to subtle task instructions. The LLM backbone
provides robust contextual comprehension and generalization capabilities, while
a fine-tuning approach is adopted to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To
enhance task adaptability, task instructions consist of fixed task keywords and
learnable, implicit prefix prompts. Frozen radio modality encoders extract
universal representations and adapter layers subsequently bridge radio and
language modalities. Moreover, lightweight task-specific heads are designed to
directly output task objectives. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that
AI2MMUM achieves SOTA performance across five representative physical
environment/wireless channel-based downstream tasks using the WAIR-D and
DeepMIMO datasets.

Conclusion: AutoCam为RAMIS中多摄像头可视化新方法奠定了基础，证实了利用da Vinci患者侧机械臂自主控制辅助摄像头的可行性。

Abstract: Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual
viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track
two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera
orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents
AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve
visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system
uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines
heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust
camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained
99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$
2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally
efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study
(N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training
task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's
viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's
improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary
camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side
manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new
multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.

Abstract: Many multi-variate time series obtained in the natural sciences and
engineering possess a repetitive behavior, as for instance state-space
trajectories of industrial machines in discrete automation. Recovering the
times of recurrence from such a multi-variate time series is of a fundamental
importance for many monitoring and control tasks. For a periodic time series
this is equivalent to determining its period length. In this work we present a
persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate
time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic,
repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods
within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using
real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding
machine.

Motivation: 传统基于分数的扩散模型在处理各向异性高斯扩散过程时，可能因需要协方差矩阵求逆而遇到困难。

Method: 提出Whitened Score扩散模型，学习白化分数函数而非标准分数，避免协方差求逆，适用于任意高斯前向噪声过程。

Result: 在CIFAR和CelebA数据集上的实验表明，WS扩散模型在各向异性高斯噪声任务中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: WS扩散模型为具有结构化噪声的成像逆问题提供了更强的贝叶斯先验，扩展了扩散模型的应用范围。

Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance
matrices in the denoising score matching training objective
\cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion
models, a novel SDE-based framework that learns the Whitened Score function
instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion,
extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary
Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with FM for
arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and
provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured
noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the
CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion
priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently
outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.

Result: 仿真显示RI-WuR-UAC协议在性能和可靠性上优于基准协议。

Conclusion: RI-WuR-UAC协议能有效优化无人机辅助网络的性能和能效。

Abstract: In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wake-up radio (WuR)-enabled
internet of things (IoT) networks, UAVs can instantly activate the main radios
(MRs) of the sensor nodes (SNs) with a wake-up call (WuC) for efficient data
collection in mission-driven data collection scenarios. However, the
spontaneous response of numerous SNs to the UAV's WuC can lead to significant
packet loss and collisions, as WuR does not exhibit its superiority for
high-traffic loads. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative
receiver-initiated WuR UAV-assisted clustering (RI-WuR-UAC) medium access
control (MAC) protocol to achieve low latency and high reliability in ultra-low
power consumption applications. We model the proposed protocol using the
$M/G/1/2$ queuing framework and derive expressions for key performance metrics,
i.e., channel busyness probability, probability of successful clustering,
average SN energy consumption, and average transmission delay. The RI-WuR-UAC
protocol employs three distinct data flow models, tailored to different network
traffic conditions, which perform three MAC mechanisms: channel assessment
(CCA) clustering for light traffic loads, backoff plus CCA clustering for dense
and heavy traffic, and adaptive clustering for variable traffic loads.
Simulation results demonstrate that the RI-WuR-UAC protocol significantly
outperforms the benchmark sub-carrier modulation clustering protocol. By
varying the network load, we capture the trade-offs among the performance
metrics, showcasing the superior efficiency and reliability of the RI-WuR-UAC
protocol.

Abstract: To circumvent the high path loss of mmWave propagation and reduce the
hardware cost of massive multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems,
full-dimensional hybrid beamforming is critical in 5G and beyond wireless
communications. Concerning an uplink multi-cell system with a large-scale
uniform planar antenna array, this paper designs an efficient hybrid beamformer
using primitive Kronecker decomposition and dynamic factor allocation, where
the analog beamformer applies to null the inter-cell interference and
simultaneously enhances the desired signals. In contrast, the digital
beamformer mitigates the intra-cell interference using the minimum mean square
error (MMSE) criterion. Then, due to the low accuracy of phase shifters
inherent in the analog beamformer, a low-complexity hybrid beamformer is
developed to slow its adjustment speed. Next, an optimality analysis from a
subspace perspective is performed, and a sufficient condition for optimal
antenna configuration is established. Finally, simulation results demonstrate
that the achievable sum rate of the proposed beamformer approaches that of the
optimal pure digital MMSE scheme, yet with much lower computational complexity
and hardware cost.

the $A^*$ decoding are usually considered. Either OSD or the $A^*$ decoding
utilizes the magnitudes of the received symbols to establish the most reliable
and independent positions (MRIP) frame. A restricted searched space can be
employed to achieve near-optimum decoding with reduced decoding complexity. For
a low-rate code with large minimum distance, the restricted search space is
still very huge.
  We propose to use concatenated coding to further restrict the search space by
proposing an improved MRIP frame. The improved MRIP frame is founded according
to magnitudes of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) obtained by the soft-in soft-out
(SISO) decoder for the inner code.
  We focus on the construction and decoding of several $(n,k)$ = (128,36)
binary linear block codes based on concatenated coding. We use the (128,36)
extended BCH (eBCH) code as a benchmark for comparison. Simulation shows that
there exist constructed concatenated codes which are much more efficient than
the (128,36) eBCH code. Some other codes of length 128 or close to 128 are also
constructed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.
