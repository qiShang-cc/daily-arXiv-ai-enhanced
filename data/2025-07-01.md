Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless
systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA
system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised
learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS
beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes
BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which
allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active
beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To
handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and
the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training
enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves
99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and
it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative localization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is
essential for the efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with
Parkinson's disease. While microelectrode recordings (MERs) provide rich
electrophysiological information during DBS electrode implantation, current
localization practices often rely on subjective interpretation of signal
features. In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that leverages
nonlinear dynamics and entropy-based metrics to classify neural activity
recorded inside versus outside the STN. MER data from three patients were
preprocessed using a robust artifact correction pipeline, segmented, and
labelled based on surgical annotations. A comprehensive set of recurrence
quantification analysis, nonlinear, and entropy features were extracted from
each segment. Multiple supervised classifiers were trained on every combination
of feature domains using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, followed by
statistical comparison using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Holm-Bonferroni correction. The combination of entropy and nonlinear features
yielded the highest discriminative power, and the Extra Trees classifier
emerged as the best model with a cross-validated F1-score of 0.902+/-0.027 and
ROC AUC of 0.887+/-0.055. Final evaluation on a 20% hold-out test set confirmed
robust generalization (F1= 0.922, ROC AUC = 0.941). These results highlight the
potential of nonlinear and entropy signal descriptors in supporting real-time,
data-driven decision-making during DBS surgeries

### [3] [Data Normalization Strategies for EEG Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22455)
*Dung Truong,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了EEG深度学习中归一化策略对监督学习和自监督学习任务的影响，发现不同任务需要不同的归一化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG深度学习中的归一化策略通常被忽视，而大规模预训练（如自监督学习）的出现带来了新的任务类型，需要研究最优的归一化策略。

Method: 系统评估了归一化粒度（记录级别vs.窗口级别）和范围（跨通道vs.通道内）对监督任务（年龄和性别预测）和自监督任务（对比预测编码）的影响。使用了2,836名受试者的高密度静息态EEG数据。

Result: 监督任务中，窗口级别通道内归一化效果最佳；而自监督任务中，窗口级别的跨通道或无归一化更有效。

Conclusion: 归一化策略需要根据任务类型定制，没有通用的方法可以适用于所有学习设置。这对EEG深度学习管道的优化提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Normalization is a critical yet often overlooked component in the
preprocessing pipeline for EEG deep learning applications. The rise of
large-scale pretraining paradigms such as self-supervised learning (SSL)
introduces a new set of tasks whose nature is substantially different from
supervised training common in EEG deep learning applications. This raises new
questions about optimal normalization strategies for the applicable task. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of normalization granularity
(recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on
both supervised (age and gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive
Predictive Coding) tasks. Using high-density resting-state EEG from 2,836
subjects in the Healthy Brain Network dataset, we show that optimal
normalization strategies differ significantly between training paradigms.
Window-level within-channel normalization yields the best performance in
supervised tasks, while minimal or cross-channel normalization at the window
level is more effective for SSL. These results underscore the necessity of
task-specific normalization choices and challenge the assumption that a
universal normalization strategy can generalize across learning settings. Our
findings provide practical insights for developing robust EEG deep learning
pipelines as the field shifts toward large-scale, foundation model training.

Abstract: The next decade will usher in a profound transformation of wireless
communication, driven by the ever-increasing demand for data-intensive
applications and the rapid adoption of emerging technologies. To fully unlock
the potential of 5G and beyond, substantial advancements are required in signal
processing techniques, innovative network architectures, and efficient spectrum

through its ability to predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
heatmaps across various scenarios, including denoising tasks, validation
datasets, extrapolation to unseen configurations, and previously unencountered
warehouse layouts. Compelling reconstruction error heatmaps are presented,
highlighting the superior accuracy of WISVA compared to traditional autoencoder
models. The paper also analyzes the model's performance in handling complex
smart warehouse environments, demonstrating its potential as a key enabler for
optimizing wireless infrastructure in Industry 4.0.
