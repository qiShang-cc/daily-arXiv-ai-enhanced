Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models,\nselected for their parameterization continuity, are identified at multiple\nconfigurations and interpolated into a global model. Inspired by joint gravity\nload expressions, we employ Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized\nby the shoulder and elbow joint angles, achieving accuracy comparable to neural\nnetwork and autoencoder methods but with substantially higher training\nefficiency. Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots shows that the proposed\napproach reduces the maximum positioning error by over 50%, meeting the\nsub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with\nlarger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit even more. A dual-robot\ncollaborative task demonstrates the framework's practical applicability and\nrepeatability."}

To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among\ncommunication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and\npower allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate\nradar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the\nfractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to\nsolve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the\nCramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between\ntargets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD\nframework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical\nperspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can\nflexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements,\nthereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of\nsensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal\nstrength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the\nactual target."}

The problem is framed as dual\ncontrol seeking a closed-loop optimal control problem that accounts for\nparameter uncertainty. We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the\nstructure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism.\nThen we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first\ndirectly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that\nminimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the\nso-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant\ninformation with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches\nreason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their\nformulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We\nshow that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the\ncontrol enables faster and more accurate task performance and system\nidentification while ensuring stable and efficient control."}

Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to\nenable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and\ncamera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a\nradar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration\nto simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)\nthe utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately\nderive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of\nfeature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations\nof mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best\nof our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of\nradar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving\nMOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline\nthe radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced\nby real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual\ntraffic scenarios.

The approach\nis divided into two stages: first, an Extended Kalman Filter and a Linear\nProgramming (LP) problem are used to estimate a compact zonotopic set of\ncontrol actions; then, a reachability analysis propagates this set to predict\nfuture occupancy. The effectiveness of the method has been validated through\nsimulations in an urban environment, showing accurate and compact predictions\nwithout relying on prior assumptions or prior training data."}

Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive\nnavigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization\naccuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To\novercome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced\nvisual SLAM framework that integrates SuperPoint and LightGlue for robust\nfeature extraction and matching. We evaluated our framework using TUM RGB-D,\nICL-NUIM, and TartanAir datasets, which feature diverse and challenging\nscenarios. SELM-SLAM3 outperforms conventional ORB-SLAM3 by an average of\n87.84% and exceeds state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77%. Our framework\ndemonstrates enhanced performance under challenging conditions, such as\nlow-texture scenes and fast motion, providing a reliable platform for\ndeveloping navigation aids for the visually impaired."}

However, current\nlarge language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks\nsuffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design\nand agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and\nperformance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address\nthese challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation\nmodel available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an\nagent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that\nintegrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task\nsuccess by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we\nincorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model\n(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.\nFor enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system\nencompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,\nhighlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging\nsimulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain\nachieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art for embodied foundation models.

To\nefficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR\ndata is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their\nangular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable\nefficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental\ngeometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,\ncompromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR\nIntrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,\nsensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from\nspinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or\ncalibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic\ngeometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters\nincluding laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam\ncalibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud\nreconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the\ncomplete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect\npoint preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric\naccuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing\ngeometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a\ncompression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,\ndemonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This\nparadigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new\npossibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete\ngeometric preservation."}
