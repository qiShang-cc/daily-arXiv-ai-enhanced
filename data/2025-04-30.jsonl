Different from prior works on 6DMA which adopt\nalternating optimization to design 6DMA positions/rotations with iterations, we\npropose a new sequential optimization approach that first determines 6DMA\nrotations and then finds their feasible positions to realize the optimized\nrotations subject to practical antenna placement constraints. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed sequential optimization significantly reduces\nthe computational complexity of conventional alternating optimization, while\nachieving comparable communication performance. It is also shown that the\nproposed SCI-based 6DMA design can effectively enhance the communication\nthroughput of wireless networks over existing fixed (position and rotation)\nantenna arrays, yet with a practically appealing low-complexity implementation."}

In this paper, a robust reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(RIS)-aided scheme for securing a full-duplex (FD) ISAC network is proposed.\nThe considered network consists of uplink and downlink users served in FD\nthrough a multi-antenna dual-functional radar communication base station (BS),\nwhich employs co-located multi-antenna communication-radar arrays to detect\nmultiple malicious targets while preserving communication secrecy in their\npresence. Additionally, the BS utilizes an optimized artificial noise (AN) that\nserves to disrupt the malicious targets' reception and increase the sensing\npower. By optimally designing the RIS phase shifts, transmit beamforming, AN\ncovariance, and uplink users' transmit power and combining vectors using an\nalternating optimization-based algorithm, the network's sensing performance is\nmaximized under secrecy and total power constraints. Numerical results present\nthe proposed scheme's efficacy, particularly when a direct link between the BS\nand the various nodes/targets is absent."}

Existing literature on SemCom\nprimarily emphasizes learning the encoder and decoder through end-to-end deep\nlearning frameworks, with the objective of minimizing a task-specific semantic\nloss function. Beyond its influence on the physical and application layer\ndesign, semantic variability across users in multi-user systems enables the\ndesign of resource allocation schemes that incorporate user-specific semantic\nrequirements. To this end, \\emph{a semantic-aware resource allocation} scheme\nis proposed with the objective of maximizing transmission and semantic\nreliability, ultimately increasing the number of users whose semantic\nrequirements are met. The resulting resource allocation problem is a non-convex\nmixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is known to be NP-hard. To make\nthe problem tractable, it is decomposed into a set of sub-problems, each of\nwhich is efficiently solved via geometric programming techniques. Finally,\nsimulations demonstrate that the proposed method improves user satisfaction by\nup to $17.1\\%$ compared to state of the art methods based on quality of\nexperience-aware SemCom methods."}

Depression and suicidal ideation, in\nparticular, lack objective biomarkers, with screening and diagnosis primarily\nrelying on self-reports and clinical interviews. Here, we investigate eye\ntracking as a potential marker modality for screening purposes. Eye movements\nare directly modulated by neuronal networks and have been associated with\nattentional and mood-related patterns; however, their predictive value for\ndepression and suicidality remains unclear. We recorded eye-tracking sequences\nfrom 126 young adults as they read and responded to affective sentences, and\nsubsequently developed a deep learning framework to predict their clinical\nstatus. The proposed model included separate branches for trials of positive\nand negative sentiment, and used 2D time-series representations to account for\nboth intra-trial and inter-trial variations. We were able to identify\ndepression and suicidal ideation with an area under the receiver operating\ncurve (AUC) of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.765-0.819) against healthy controls, and\nsuicidality specifically with 0.826 AUC (95% CI: 0.797-0.852). The model also\nexhibited moderate, yet significant, accuracy in differentiating depressed from\nsuicidal participants, with 0.609 AUC (95% CI 0.571-0.646). Discriminative\npatterns emerge more strongly when assessing the data relative to response\ngeneration than relative to the onset time of the final word of the sentences.\nThe most pronounced effects were observed for negative-sentiment sentences,\nthat are congruent to depressed and suicidal participants. Our findings\nhighlight eye tracking as an objective tool for mental health assessment and\nunderscore the modulatory impact of emotional stimuli on cognitive processes\naffecting oculomotor control."}
