A fundamental question,\nhowever, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of\nspatial multiplexing in the distance domain?\n  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF\nof a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit\naperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at\nthe same angular direction) but located at different distances from the\ntransmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are\ncontinuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and\ninfinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees\nof freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case\nwhere the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad\nside of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral\noperator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form\nexpression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows\nthat the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the\nextreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We\nfurther extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a\nprojection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent\nbroadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular\narray, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the\nconstraint of the physical length of the array."}

On the other hand, the\nexisting end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds\nthe speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech,\nresulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and\nresonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying\nspeech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation\nusually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption.\nIn this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech\nas sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process\nto propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech\nsignals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to\nmodel the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the\namplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the\nspeech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting\nand time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network\nsize decrease. The experiments indicate that the proposed method leverages the\nstrengths of QHM, the ARMA model, and neural networks, leading to the\noutperformance of our methods over other methods in terms of generation speed,\nsynthesis quality, and modification flexibility."}

Joint spatial division and\nmultiplexing (JSDM) emerges as a low-overhead transmission scheme for\nmulti-user equipment (UE) scenarios, typically requiring complex matrix\ndecomposition to achieve block-diagonalization of the effective channel matrix.\nIn this study, we introduce an innovative JSDM design that leverages RISs to\ncustomize channels, thereby streamlining the overall procedures. By\nstrategically positioning RISs at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)\ndirections of the base station (BS), we establish orthogonal line-of-sight\nlinks within the BS-RIS channel, enabling a straightforward pre-beamforming\ndesign. Based on UE grouping, we devise reflected beams of the RIS with\noptimized directions to mitigate inter-group interference in the RISs-UEs\nchannel. An approximation of the channel cross-correlation coefficient is\nderived and serves as a foundation for the RISs-UEs association, further\ndiminishing inter-group interference. Numerical results substantiate the\nefficacy of our RIS-customized JSDM in not only achieving effective channel\nblock-diagonalization but also in significantly enhancing the sum spectral\nefficiency for multi-UE transmissions."}

Superposition coding (SC) and\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques are utilized for the\nintegrated navigation and communication (INAC) networks, and the composed\nnavigation and communication signals are reflected or transmitted to ground\nusers or indoor users located in urban canyons. To meet diverse application\nneeds, navigation-oriented (NO)-INAC and communication-oriented (CO)-INAC have\nbeen developed, each tailored according to distinct power allocation factors.\nWe then proposed two algorithms, namely navigation-prioritized-algorithm (NPA)\nand communication-prioritized-algorithm (CPA), to improve the navigation or\ncommunication performance by selecting the satellite with the optimized\nposition dilution of precision (PDoP) or with the best channel gain. The\neffectiveness of the proposed STAR-RIS-aided INAC network is quantified by\nanalyzing the positioning error for navigation services and by evaluating\ncommunication performance through achievable ergodic rate metrics. Our\nsatellite selection approach indicates that: the positioning services at the\nurban canyon users can be completed with the aid of STAR-RIS. 2) Additionally,\nit is observed that while a single STAR-RIS array can extend the navigational\nlink, it fails to serve users in indoor scenarios, highlighting a limitation in\nthe current system design."}

In contrast to\nprior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)\napproximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information\nto capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian\nmatrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned\nwhen the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a\nmore reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate\nthe rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a\nquadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in\ngeneral. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular\nfunction maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with\napproximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under\nwhich the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a\nclosed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid\ntheoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational\nefficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,\nalternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank\nbudget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms\nexisting methods in both rank determination and joint training performance."}
