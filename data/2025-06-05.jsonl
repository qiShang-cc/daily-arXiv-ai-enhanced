We evaluate four Wav2vec2.0 base models that were pre-trained on\nboth tonal and non-tonal languages. We analyze tone-wise performance across the\nlayers for all three languages and compare the different models. Our results\nshow that tone recognition works best for Mizo and worst for Angami. The middle\nlayers of the SSL models are the most important for tone recognition,\nregardless of the pre-training language, i.e. tonal or non-tonal. We have also\nfound that the tone inventory, tone types, and dialectal variations affect tone\nrecognition. These findings provide useful insights into the strengths and\nweaknesses of SSL-based embeddings for tonal languages and highlight the\npotential for improving tone recognition in low-resource settings.

The\nISAC base station (BS) transmits signals to communicate with users in an\neavesdropped scenario and to estimate the parameters of the sensed targets. The\nresearch considers different sensing signals under RSMA technology and the\nCram{\\'{e}}r-Rao bound of the parameter estimation is utilized as the sensing\nmetric. With the channel state information (CSI) of eavesdroppers known, the\ntransmitting beam of the BS is optimized to maximize the energy efficiency in\nterms of the minimum user rate and secrecy capacity, considering the fairness\namong users and ensuring the sensing performance and communication security.\nWith the CSI of eavesdroppers unknown, the transmitting beam of the BS is\ndesigned to minimize the energy consumption for sensing and communication, and\nthe residual power is utilized for artificial noise, which is isotropically\nemitted to achieve interference with potential eavesdroppers. To solve the\nnon-convex problems, three iterative algorithms based on successive convex\napproximation and penalty function are proposed. The simulation results\nillustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes."}

Efficient joint\nchannel and power allocation (JCPA) is crucial for managing interference. In\nthis paper, we first propose an enhanced WMMSE (eWMMSE) algorithm to solve the\nJCPA problem in multi-channel wireless networks. To reduce the computational\ncomplexity of iterative optimization, we further introduce JCPGNN-M, a graph\nneural network-based solution that enables simultaneous multi-channel\nallocation for each user. We reformulate the problem as a Lagrangian function,\nwhich allows us to enforce the total power constraints systematically. Our\nsolution involves combining this Lagrangian framework with GNNs and iteratively\nupdating the Lagrange multipliers and resource allocation scheme. Unlike\nexisting GNN-based methods that limit each user to a single channel, JCPGNN-M\nsupports efficient spectrum reuse and scales well in dense network scenarios.\nSimulation results show that JCPGNN-M achieves better data rate compared to\neWMMSE. Meanwhile, the inference time of JCPGNN-M is much lower than eWMMS, and\nit can generalize well to larger networks."}

However, even when the base station (BS) has perfect\nchannel knowledge and can compute the optimal RIS phase-shift configuration,\nimplementing this configuration requires feedback signaling over a control\nchannel from the BS to the RIS. This feedback must be kept minimal, as it is\ntransmitted wirelessly every time the channel changes. In this paper, we\nexamine how the feedback load, measured in bits, affects the performance of an\nRIS-aided system. Specifically, we investigate the trade-offs between\ncodebook-based and element-wise feedback schemes, and how these influence the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We propose a novel quantization codebook tailored\nfor line-of-sight (LoS) that guarantees a minimal SNR loss using a number of\nfeedback bits that scale logarithmically with the number of RIS elements. We\ndemonstrate the codebook's usefulness over Rician fading channels and how to\nextend it to handle a non-zero static path. Numerical simulations and\nanalytical analysis are performed to quantify the performance degradation that\nresults from a reduced feedback load, shedding light on how efficiently RIS\nconfigurations can be fed back in practical systems."}

Specifically, in\nthis problem, one is given two databases of sequences and the task is to\nidentify all matched pairs of sequences. In each database, each sequence is\ngenerated i.i.d. from a distinct distribution and a pair of sequences is said\nmatched if they are generated from the same distribution. The generating\ndistribution of each sequence is \\emph{unknown}. We first consider the case\nwhere the number of matches is known and derive the exact exponential decay\nrate of the mismatch (error) probability, a.k.a. the mismatch exponent, under\neach hypothesis for optimal sequential tests. Our results reveal the benefit of\nsequentiality by showing that optimal sequential tests have larger mismatch\nexponent than fixed-length tests by Zhou \\emph{et al.} (TIT 2024).\nSubsequently, we generalize our achievability result to the case of unknown\nnumber of matches. In this case, two additional error probabilities arise:\nfalse alarm and false reject probabilities. We propose a corresponding\nsequential test, show that the test has bounded expected stopping time under\ncertain conditions, and characterize the tradeoff among the exponential decay\nrates of three error probabilities. Furthermore, we reveal the benefit of\nsequentiality over the two-step fixed-length test by Zhou \\emph{et al.} (TIT\n2024) and propose an one-step fixed-length test that has no worse performance\nthan the fixed-length test by Zhou \\emph{et al.} (TIT 2024). When specialized\nto the case where either database contains a single sequence, our results\nspecialize to large deviations of sequential tests for statistical\nclassification, the binary case of which was recently studied by Hsu, Li and\nWang (ITW 2022)."}
