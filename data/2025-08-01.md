*Bin Deng,Jiatong Bai,Feilong Zhao,Zuming Xie,Maolin Li,Yan Wang,Feng Shu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 异构混合模拟-数字H2AD MIMO结构有望替代大规模全数字MIMO，但如何智能感知多发射源的数量和方向仍具挑战。论文提出两阶段感知框架，包括三种目标数量感知方法和一种高效DOA估计方法，性能优于现有技术。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模全数字MIMO的高能耗、高成本和复杂性问题，H2AD MIMO结构虽具潜力，但多发射源数量和方向的智能感知问题尚未解决。

Method: 提出两阶段感知框架，设计三种目标数量感知方法（改进EDC、增强DNN和1D-CNN）和一种低复杂度高精度DOA估计方法（OMC-DOA），并推导CRLB作为理论基准。

Result: 三种方法在中高信噪比下实现100%目标感知，1D-CNN在极低信噪比下表现优异；OMC-DOA在多源环境优于现有DOA方法。

Conclusion: H2AD MIMO结构通过智能感知框架解决多源问题，为未来无线网络提供了高效、低成本的替代方案。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

### [3] [Neural Energy Landscapes Predict Working Memory Decline After Brain Tumor Resection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23057)
*Triet M. Tran,Sina Khanmohammadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了脑肿瘤术前神经动力学变化与术后工作记忆下降的关系，通过fMRI分析和高阶脑交互能量景观，发现术前能量特征能准确预测术后认知下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤手术切除可能导致术后认知功能障碍，研究旨在探究术前神经动力学变化与术后工作记忆下降的关系。

Method: 分析脑肿瘤患者术前的fMRI数据，提取高阶脑交互能量景观特征，并结合统计与随机森林模型分析其与术后工作记忆表现的关系。

Result: 术后工作记忆较低的患者表现出能量极值间较少但更极端的转换，术前能量特征能90%准确预测术后认知下降。

Conclusion: 术前高阶神经动力学变化可预测术后工作记忆下降，为个性化手术规划和干预提供了依据。

Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

### [5] [BS-1-to-N: Diffusion-Based Environment-Aware Cross-BS Channel Knowledge Map Generation for Cell-Free Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23236)
*Zhuoyin Dai,Di Wu,Yong Zeng,Xiaoli Xu,Xinyi Wang,Zesong Fei*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成扩散模型的环境感知跨基站（BS）信道知识图（CKM）推断方法BS-1-to-N，通过BS位置嵌入和注意力机制实现高效推断，并在分布式网络中展示了其实际应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现跨基站的高效环境感知通信是优化网络性能的关键，传统方法在多分布节点网络中成本过高。

Method: 设计了BS位置嵌入（BSLE）方法，结合交叉和自注意力机制，利用生成扩散模型实现跨BS的CKM推断。

Result: BS-1-to-N模型能够在任意潜在位置基于源BS的CKMs高效推断目标BS的CKM，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过挖掘CKM与BS位置的隐式相关性，为基站部署优化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) inference across base stations (BSs) is the key
to achieving efficient environmentaware communications. This paper proposes an
environmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the
generative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location
embedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS
location information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the
cross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to
respectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as
that among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target
BSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM
inference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.
Specifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free
networks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM
construction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N
model is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any
potential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by
exploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same
wireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to
multi-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same
wireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit
correlation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the
proposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs. We
provide extensive comparisons of CKM inference between the proposed BS-1-to-N
generative model versus benchmarking schemes, and provide one use case study to
demonstrate its practical application for the optimization of BS deployment.

### [6] [A Secure Full-Duplex Wireless Circulator enabled by Non-Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal RIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23381)
*Ziang Liu,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用NR-BD-RIS的非互易性和波束重构能力，解决全双工通信中的安全问题和非对齐收发器的通信需求。

Method: 通过结合结构散射效应，提出了一种基于块坐标下降（BCD）和惩罚对偶分解（PDD）的迭代优化算法，以最大化用户总速率。

Result: 数值评估表明，NR-BD-RIS在支持多方向波束时，性能优于传统对角RIS和互易性RIS，并能有效实现安全传输。

Conclusion: NR-BD-RIS在全双工通信中展现出显著优势，为未来的无线通信系统提供了一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a
promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling
flexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the
interconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave
reconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at
one port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local
control of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further
enhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,
channel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among
non-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of
NR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices
communicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure
transmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses
signal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a
physics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural
scattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,
the advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate
an all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization
algorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual
decomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS
consistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal
(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two
impinging and reflection directions need to be supported. By analyzing the
power of signals from all other users and the beampatterns, we show that secure
transmission can be achieved.

### [7] [EVMx: An FPGA-Based Smart Contract Processing Unit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23518)
*Joel Poncha Lemayian,Hachem Bensalem,Ghyslain Gagnon,Kaiwen Zhang,Pascal Giard*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于FPGA的硬件执行引擎EVMx，用于加速以太坊虚拟机（EVM）的智能合约执行，相比传统的CPU执行环境显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EVM的性能受限于通用计算机的限制，影响了智能合约的执行效率和区块链平台的性能。

Method: 通过设计一个基于FPGA的专用硬件执行引擎EVMx，利用硬件的并行性和高速处理能力来加速智能合约的执行。

Result: 实验结果显示，EVMx在常用操作码上减少了61%至99%的执行时间，且以太坊区块的执行速度比文献中的类似工作快6倍。

Conclusion: EVMx展示了硬件加速在提升EVM兼容区块链性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: Ethereum blockchain uses smart contracts (SCs) to implement decentralized
applications (dApps). SCs are executed by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)
running within an Ethereum client. Moreover, the EVM has been widely adopted by
other blockchain platforms, including Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and
more. However, the EVM performance is limited by the constraints of the
general-purpose computer it operates on. This work proposes offloading SC
execution onto a dedicated hardware-based EVM. Specifically, EVMx is an
FPGA-based SC execution engine that benefits from the inherent parallelism and
high-speed processing capabilities of a hardware architecture. Synthesis
results demonstrate a reduction in execution time of 61% to 99% for commonly
used operation codes compared to CPU-based SC execution environments. Moreover,
the execution time of Ethereum blocks on EVMx is up to 6x faster compared to
analogous works in the literature. These results highlight the potential of the
proposed architecture to accelerate SC execution and enhance the performance of
EVM-compatible blockchains.

### [8] [Channel Estimation for 6G Near-Field Wireless Communications: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23526)
*Wen-Xuan Long,Shengyu Ye,Marco Moretti,Michele Morelli,Luca Sanguinetti,Rui Chen,Cheng-Xiang Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文总结了6G系统中极大型天线阵列（ELAA）的近场信道估计最新进展，分析了近场与远场的电磁边界、主要信道模型及估计方法，并探讨了其准确性与复杂度的权衡。


<details>

Conclusion: 本文为6G近场信道估计提供了系统性的综述，指出了关键挑战和未来研究方向，有助于推动高效可扩展技术的开发。

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are expected to adopt extremely
large aperture arrays (ELAAs), novel antenna architectures, and operate in
extremely high-frequency bands to meet growing data demands. ELAAs
significantly increase the number of antennas, enabling finer spatial
resolution and improved beamforming. At high frequencies, ELAAs shift
communication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where
spherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle
and distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel
estimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field
scenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel
estimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an
electromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences,
alongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream
near-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major
estimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations
(single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and
RIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among
estimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide
insights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel
estimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research
directions.

*Manjun Cui,Zhichao Zhang,Wei Yao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出两种多参数图分数阶傅里叶变换（MPGFRFT）及其理论框架，解决传统GFRFT全局分数阶限制问题，并通过谱压缩策略和学习阶向量提升灵活性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图分数阶傅里叶变换（GFRFT）对所有频率使用单一分数阶，难以适应不同信号特性。本文旨在提升其适应性和灵活性。

Method: 1. 设计两种MPGFRFT及其理论框架。2. 提出超低压缩比的谱压缩策略。3. 引入可学习阶向量方案，用于自适应压缩和去噪。

Result: 实验证明MPGFRFT在多种图信号处理任务中具有出色性能，并成功应用于图像加密与解密。

Conclusion: MPGFRFT框架在提升灵活性和性能方面表现出色，适用于多种信号处理场景。

Abstract: The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) applies a single global
fractional order to all graph frequencies, which restricts its adaptability to
diverse signal characteristics across the spectral domain. To address this
limitation, in this paper, we propose two types of multiple-parameter GFRFTs
(MPGFRFTs) and establish their corresponding theoretical frameworks. We design
a spectral compression strategy tailored for ultra-low compression ratios,
effectively preserving essential information even under extreme dimensionality
reduction. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a learnable order vector scheme
that enables adaptive compression and denoising, demonstrating strong
performance on both graph signals and images. We explore the application of
MPGFRFTs to image encryption and decryption. Experimental results validate the
versatility and superior performance of the proposed MPGFRFT framework across
various graph signal processing tasks.

Abstract: We present a comparative study of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the
Deep Autoencoder Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM) for estimating satellite

Result: 找到保证凸性的充分条件，识别一类无需变量变换的加权和速率最大化问题。

Conclusion: 理论成果促进高效求解器开发，并为直接以速率而非SINR建模问题提供依据。

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless
networks, with a focus on the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) and
achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into
interference patterns of modern network architectures, such as cell-less and
extremely large MIMO networks, and it generalizes existing characterizations of
the weak Pareto boundary. A central contribution is the derivation of
sufficient conditions that guarantee convexity of the utility regions.
Convexity is an important property because it ensures that time sharing (or
user grouping) cannot simultaneously increase the utility of all users when the
network operates on the weak Pareto boundary. These sufficient conditions also
have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate
maximization problems that are inherently convex without any variable
transformations, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably
optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide a rigorous justification
for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable
rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an
alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO
literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the
beamforming strategy.

Abstract: Real-time transmission of high-resolution video signals in an uncompressed
and unencrypted format requires an ultra-reliable and low-latency
communications (URLLC) medium with high bandwidth to maintain the quality of
experience (QoE) for users. We put forward the design and experimental
demonstration of a high-performance laser-based optical wireless communication
(OWC) system that enables high-definition (HD) video transmission with
submillisecond latencies. The serial digital interface (SDI) output of a camera
is used to transmit the live video stream over an optical wireless link by
directly modulating the SDI signal on the intensity of a 940 nm vertical cavity
surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The proposed SDI over light fidelity (LiFi)
system corroborates error-free transmission of full HD (FHD) and 4K
ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions at data rates of 2.97 Gb/s and 5.94
Gb/s, respectively, with a measured end-to-end latency of under 35 ns. Since
SDI standards support various video formats and VCSELs are high-bandwidth and
low-power devices, this presents a scalable and inexpensive solution for
wireless connectivity between professional broadcast equipment using
off-the-shelf SDI components.

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed

Abstract: Having established that Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences are inherently linear

using the lmFH pattern. This yields interesting results. Subsequently, an
alternative form for computing the cumulative sum of ZC sequences using the
Generalized Quadratic Gauss Sum is introduced. Furthermore, building on the
micro-frequency hopping (mFH) concept, this paper shows that the DFT of ZC
sequences can be transformed into an lmFH symbol with frequency shift and phase
offset. Therefore, the DFT of ZC sequences can be computed via cumulative
frequency points, similar to the computation of normal mFH symbols.

downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to
simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target's angular location, and
counteract eavesdropping threats. The attack model considers a passive
single-antenna communication eavesdropper intercepting communication data, as
well as a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target's
location. We also consider a malicious target scenario where the target plays
the role of the communication eavesdropper. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers
channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target's azimuth angle is uniformly
distributed. To evaluate the performance in this random network, we derive the
ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), for
target localization, at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves
computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. We
characterize the boundary of the CRB-secrecy rate region, and interpret the
performance tradeoffs between communication and sensing while guaranteeing a
level of security and privacy in the random ISAC networks.

Abstract: As satellite communications play an increasingly important role in future
wireless networks, the issue of limited link budget in satellite systems has
attracted significant attention in current research. Although semantic
communications emerge as a promising solution to address these constraints, it
introduces the challenge of increased computational resource consumption in
wireless communications. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-layer
hybrid bit and generative semantic communication framework which can adapt to
the dynamic satellite communication networks. Furthermore, to balance the
semantic communication efficiency and performance in satellite-to-ground
transmissions, we introduce a novel semantic communication efficiency metric
(SEM) that evaluates the trade-offs among latency, computational consumption,
and semantic reconstruction quality in the proposed framework. Moreover, we
utilize a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to optimize the resource allocation in the proposed
network. Simulation results demonstrate the flexibility of our proposed
transmission framework and the effectiveness of the proposed metric SEM,
illustrate the relationships among various semantic communication metrics.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (BDRISs) into cell free massive multiple input multiple output
(CFmMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users energy
receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time
frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving
ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A
protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs
to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently,
closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average
sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive
optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power
control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term
statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then
effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems,
efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the
scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep
reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power
control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully
connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the
conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in
the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix
design is employed.

TL;DR: WiRM是一种两阶段的无接触呼吸监测方法，通过相位净化和自适应多迹追踪提升呼吸率估计，并利用改进的呼吸率估计提取呼吸波形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法或仅监测呼吸率，或仅关注呼吸波形，无法全面监测呼吸健康。WiRM旨在提供更全面的解决方案。

Method: WiRM分为两阶段：1) 通过共轭乘法和自适应多迹追踪提升呼吸率估计；2) 利用改进的呼吸率估计从CSI数据中分解和选择呼吸波形。

Result: WiRM在呼吸率估计上平均减少38%的RMSE，呼吸波形的平均绝对相关性提升178.3%，且在噪声环境中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: WiRM在无接触呼吸监测中取得了显著改进，尤其在噪声环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Monitoring respiratory health with the use of channel state information (CSI)
has shown promising results. Many existing methods focus on monitoring only the
respiratory rate, while others focus on monitoring the motion of the chest as a
patient breathes, which is referred to as the respiratory waveform. This paper
presents WiRM, a two-staged approach to contactless respiration monitoring. In
the first stage, WiRM improves upon existing respiratory rate estimation
techniques by using conjugate multiplication for phase sanitisation and
adaptive multi-trace carving (AMTC) for tracing how the respiratory rate
changes over time. When compared against three state-of-the-art methods, WiRM
has achieved an average reduction of $38\%$ in respiratory rate root mean
squared error (RMSE). In the second stage, WiRM uses this improved respiratory
rate estimate to inform the decomposition and selection of the respiratory
waveform from the CSI data. Remarkably, WiRM delivers a $178.3\%$ improvement
in average absolute correlation with the ground truth respiratory waveform.
Within the literature, it is difficult to compare the robustness of existing
algorithms in noisy environments. In this paper, we develop a purpose-built
simulation toolkit to evaluate the robustness of respiration monitoring
solutions under various noise conditions, including thermal, multiplicative,
and phase noise. Our results show that WiRM demonstrates improved or comparable
resilience to these common noise sources.

Abstract: Due to the diverse physical attributes of computing resources and tasks,
developing effective mechanisms to facilitate task and resource matching in
complex connected systems for value-oriented task completion has become
increasingly challenging. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a
networked physical computing system that integrates the physical attributes of
computing resources and tasks as well as task-specific trust relationships
among devices to enable value-driven task completion. Specifically, we propose
a state-of-the-art hypergraph-aided trusted task-resource matching
(TTR-matching) framework to achieve the envisioned physical computing. First, a
task-specific trusted physical resource hypergraph is defined, which integrates
task-specific trust, the physical attributes of resources, and task types. This
enables accurate modeling of device collaboration dependencies under specific
task types. Next, a task hypergraph is generated to associate the task
initiator with the physical attributes of the corresponding tasks. Based on
these two hypergraphs, a hypergraph matching algorithm is designed to
facilitate task-specific trusted collaborator selection and accurate
task-resource matching for value-maximizing task completion. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TTR-matching framework
outperforms comparison algorithms in identifying task-specific trustworthy
collaborators and maximizing the average value of task completion.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了外骨骼锚点位置对步态、肌肉活动和能量消耗的影响，发现个性化配置能显著提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锚点位置是外骨骼设计中的关键因素，但其对穿戴者步态、肌肉活动和能量消耗的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过11名受试者穿戴XoSoft外骨骼进行六次实验，测量不同锚点配置下的运动学、肌电和代谢数据。

Result: 后膝锚点与前髋锚点组合可减少髋屈肌激活10.21%和代谢消耗18.45%，且所有配置均影响膝踝运动学。

Conclusion: 锚点位置对外骨骼效能有显著影响，但最优配置因人而异，需进一步开发个性化模型以适用于临床人群。

Abstract: Anchor point placement is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of exosuit
design since it determines how forces interact with the human body. This work
analyzes the impact of different anchor point positions on gait kinematics,
muscular activation and energetic consumption. A total of six experiments were
conducted with 11 subjects wearing the XoSoft exosuit, which assists hip
flexion in five configurations. Subjects were instrumented with an IMU-based
motion tracking system, EMG sensors, and a mask to measure metabolic
consumption. The results show that positioning the knee anchor point on the
posterior side while keeping the hip anchor on the anterior part can reduce
muscle activation in the hip flexors by up to 10.21\% and metabolic expenditure
by up to 18.45\%. Even if the only assisted joint was the hip, all the
configurations introduced changes also in the knee and ankle kinematics.
Overall, no single configuration was optimal across all subjects, suggesting
that a personalized approach is necessary to transmit the assistance forces
optimally. These findings emphasize that anchor point position does indeed have
a significant impact on exoskeleton effectiveness and efficiency. However,
these optimal positions are subject-specific to the exosuit design, and there
is a strong need for future work to tailor musculoskeletal models to individual
characteristics and validate these results in clinical populations.

TL;DR: EMORe是一种自适应重建方法，旨在提升5D心脏磁共振成像中的运动鲁棒性，通过自适应修正和异常数据剔除减少运动伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统5D MRI的自运动门控方法因信号提取不准确和偶发运动导致伪影，影响临床可用性。

Method: 结合自适应修正和异常数据剔除的期望最大化框架，交替执行E步和M步直至收敛。

Result: 实验证明EMORe在信噪比、结构相似性和边缘清晰度上优于传统压缩感知重建，且体内实验验证了其运动鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 尽管计算复杂度略有增加，EMORe显著提升了5D心脏MRI的临床适用性和诊断信心。

Abstract: We propose EMORe, an adaptive reconstruction method designed to enhance
motion robustness in free-running, free-breathing self-gated 5D cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Traditional self-gating-based motion binning
for 5D MRI often results in residual motion artifacts due to inaccuracies in
cardiac and respiratory signal extraction and sporadic bulk motion,
compromising clinical utility. EMORe addresses these issues by integrating
adaptive inter-bin correction and explicit outlier rejection within an
expectation-maximization (EM) framework, whereby the E-step and M-step are
executed alternately until convergence. In the E-step, probabilistic (soft) bin
assignments are refined by correcting misassignment of valid data and rejecting
motion-corrupted data to a dedicated outlier bin. In the M-step, the image
estimate is improved using the refined soft bin assignments. Validation in a
simulated 5D MRXCAT phantom demonstrated EMORe's superior performance compared
to standard compressed sensing reconstruction, showing significant improvements
in peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, edge sharpness, and
bin assignment accuracy across varying levels of simulated bulk motion. In vivo
validation in 13 volunteers further confirmed EMORe's robustness, significantly
enhancing blood-myocardium edge sharpness and reducing motion artifacts
compared to compressed sensing, particularly in scenarios with controlled
coughing-induced motion. Although EMORe incurs a modest increase in
computational complexity, its adaptability and robust handling of bulk motion
artifacts significantly enhance the clinical applicability and diagnostic
confidence of 5D cardiac MRI.
