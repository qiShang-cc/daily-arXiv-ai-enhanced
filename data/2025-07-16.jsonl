Robust Minimum\nRedundancy Arrays (RMRAs), a specialized class of TFRAs, optimize this\nredundancy to achieve the maximum possible aperture for a given number of\nsensors. However, finding optimal RMRA configurations is an NP-hard problem,\nwith prior research reporting optimal solutions only for arrays of up to ten\nsensors. This paper presents newly discovered optimal RMRA configurations for\narray sizes 11 to 15, identified using a novel Leap-on-Success exhaustive\nsearch algorithm that efficiently reduces computational effort by terminating\nthe search upon locating optimal solutions. The robustness of these arrays was\nvalidated under all single-element failure scenarios using MATLAB simulations,\nconfirming their superior resilience compared to some existing TFRAs vulnerable\nto failures at specific sensor positions. Furthermore, near-optimal\nconfigurations for array sizes 16 to 20 are also reported, highlighting the\npotential applicability of the proposed method for larger array designs given\nsufficient computational resources.

This paper\ninvestigates the optimization of the sensing accuracy of a UAV swarm deployed\nto perform multi-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)\nsensing. In conventional single-baseline InSAR systems, only one synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) antenna pair acquires two SAR images from two distinct\nangles to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) of the target area.
