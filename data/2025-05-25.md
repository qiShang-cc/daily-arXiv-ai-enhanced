*Taofeek A. O. Yusuf,Sigurd S. Petersen,Puchu Li,Jian Ren,Placido Mursia,Vincenzo Sciancalepore,Xavier Costa Pérez,Gilberto Berardinelli,Ming Shen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个基于AI的框架，利用定制卷积神经网络（cCNN）来提高RIS在6G智能工厂中的定位精度，特别是在NLOS条件下，准确率达到95%-99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业4.0时代，精确的室内定位对智能工厂的自动化和效率至关重要。RIS在6G网络中表现突出，但在NLOS和多径传播条件下仍面临挑战。

Method: 采用定制化的CNN模型，通过实测、合成、混合实测和混合合成数据来分类LOS和NLOS条件，提升RIS定位性能。

Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0, precise indoor localization is vital for
automation and efficiency in smart factories. Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surfaces (RIS) are emerging as key enablers in 6G networks for joint sensing
and communication. However, RIS faces significant challenges in
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and multipath propagation, particularly in
localization scenarios, where detecting NLOS conditions is crucial for ensuring
not only reliable results and increased connectivity but also the safety of
smart factory personnel. This study introduces an AI-assisted framework
employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) customized for accurate
Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) classification to enhance
RIS-based localization using measured, synthetic, mixed-measured, and
mixed-synthetic experimental data, that is, original, augmented, slightly
noisy, and highly noisy data, respectively. Validated through such data from
three different environments, the proposed customized-CNN (cCNN) model achieves
{95.0\%-99.0\%} accuracy, outperforming standard pre-trained models like Visual
Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16) with an accuracy of {85.5\%-88.0\%}. By addressing
RIS limitations in NLOS scenarios, this framework offers scalable and
high-precision localization solutions for 6G-enabled smart factories.

Conclusion: 四元数为光学系统建模提供了更高效的工具，尤其适用于波片系统的分析与设计，并为新型光学器件（如无尽相位调制器）提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The usual way to describe mathematically a beam of coherent light passing
through a system of waveplates is via the Jones vector and Jones matrix. This
paper will show that a quaternion can be used to represent both the optical
signal and the waveplate component it passes through, replacing the Jones
vector and the Jones matrix. The quaternion description is easier to manipulate
than the matrix-vector description; for example it can be inverted. As well as
the Jones vector, the state of polarization (SOP) of an optical signal is often
described as a three-dimensional vector on the Poincar\'e sphere, or as a
polarization ellipse, and it will be shown how these three forms are closely
related to the quaternion representation. Similarly, the action of a waveplate
may be represented as a rotation about an axis on the Poincar\'e sphere, and
that rotation is shown to have a logarithm-exponential relationship to the
waveplate's quaternion. The paper presents rules to decide if two optical
signals are aligned or orthogonal in phase or in polarization from their
quaternions, and presents the quaternion operations to change the phase or
change the SOP. Light passing through a system of waveplates is written as a
product of quaternions, and it can be hard to simplify or manipulate that
expression because quaternion multiplication does not commute. The paper brings
together several mathematical tools that allow such a quaternion product to be
rearranged, including the new idea of partial conjugation. Finally, a worked
example is included of the quaternion mathematics applied to a waveplate
problem that has not been solved before. It is shown that an endless optical
phase shifter can be built using three rotatable waveplates, and equations for
the angles of rotation are derived to produce the desired phase shift for given
input and output SOPs.

### [3] [Beamforming-Codebook-Aware Channel Knowledge Map Construction for Multi-Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16132)
*Haohan Wang,Xu Shi,Hengyu Zhang,Yashuai Cao,Jintao Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于TransUNet的框架，用于构建信道知识地图（CKM），并通过结合离散傅里叶变换（DFT）预编码向量解决了MIMO系统的波束形成需求。该方法在RMSE上比现有深度学习模型提升了17%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CKM构建方法主要针对单天线系统，无法满足MIMO系统的波束形成需求，因此需要一种能够高效处理MIMO配置的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种TransUNet框架，结合UNet的多尺度特征提取和Transformer模块来捕捉全局依赖关系，并集成了DFT预编码向量。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在RMSE上比当前最先进的深度学习模型RadioWNet提升了17%。

Conclusion: TransUNet框架在CKM构建中表现优异，尤其在MIMO系统中具有显著优势，代码已公开。

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) has emerged as a crucial technology for
next-generation communication, enabling the construction of high-fidelity
mappings between spatial environments and channel parameters via
electromagnetic information analysis. Traditional CKM construction methods like
ray tracing are computationally intensive. Recent studies utilizing neural
networks (NNs) have achieved efficient CKM generation with reduced
computational complexity and real-time processing capabilities. Nevertheless,
existing research predominantly focuses on single-antenna systems, failing to
address the beamforming requirements inherent to MIMO configurations. Given
that appropriate precoding vector selection in MIMO systems can substantially
enhance user communication rates, this paper presents a TransUNet-based
framework for constructing CKM, which effectively incorporates discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) precoding vectors. The proposed architecture combines a UNet
backbone for multiscale feature extraction with a Transformer module to capture
global dependencies among encoded linear vectors. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning (DL) approaches, yielding a 17\% improvement in RMSE compared to
RadioWNet. The code is publicly accessible at

### [4] [Synthesis of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Waveforms using a Hybrid Generative Model and a Lung Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16462)
*Sagar Deep Deb,Suvakash Dey,Deepak K. Agrawal*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合数学模型和深度生成模型的方法，用于生成合成且临床相关的呼吸机不同步（VD）波形数据，以提高VD检测算法的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动检测呼吸机不同步（VD）不可靠且耗时，而现有机器学习模型因缺乏大规模、高质量标注的VD波形数据集而精度受限。因此，需要生成合成数据以解决这一问题。

Method: 论文提出了VD肺呼吸机模型（VDLV）来模拟临床观察到的压力和容积波形变形，并结合生成对抗网络（GAN）和条件GAN（cGAN）进一步多样化数据集。

Result: 混合方法生成的合成VD波形具有较高的真实性和多样性，尤其是cGAN模型能生成更精确的VD信号，为算法训练提供优质数据。

Conclusion: 通过数学模型和深度生成模型的结合，该方法有望显著提升VD检测算法的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) is often described as a mismatch between a
patient breathing effort and the ventilator support during mechanical
ventilation. This mismatch is often associated with an increased risk of lung
injury and longer hospital stays. The manual VD detection method is unreliable
and requires considerable effort from medical professionals. Automating this
process requires a computational pipeline that can identify VD breaths from
continuous waveform signals. For that, while various machine learning (ML)
models have been proposed, their accuracy is often limited due to the
unavailability of a large, well-annotated VD waveform dataset. This paper
presents a new approach combining mathematical and deep generative models to
generate synthetic, clinically relevant VD waveforms. The mathematical model,
which we call the VD lung ventilator model (VDLV), can accurately replicate
clinically observable deformation in the pressure and volume waveforms. These
temporal deformations are hypothesized to be related to specific VD breaths. We
leverage the VDLV model to produce training waveform datasets covering normal
and various VD breaths. These datasets are further diversified using deep
learning models such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Conditional
GAN (cGAN). The performance of both GAN and cGAN models is assessed through
quantitative metrics, demonstrating that this hybrid approach effectively
creates realistic and diverse VD waveforms. Notably, the pressure and volume
cGAN models enable the generation of more precise and targeted VD signals.
These improved synthetic waveform datasets have the potential to significantly
enhance the accuracy and robustness of VD detection algorithms.

### [5] [A Tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling, Architectures, System Design and Optimization, and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16504)
*Hongyu Li,Matteo Nerini,Shanpu Shen,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BD-RIS) 是一种新兴且革命性的技术，相比传统对角 RIS (D-RIS)，BD-RIS 的散射矩阵不受对角限制，具有更高的波操控灵活性，并为通信、感知和能量传输等多领域应用提供了更广泛的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 D-RIS 由于其对角散射矩阵限制了波的操控灵活性，而 BD-RIS 突破了这一限制，通过引入非对角的散射矩阵和可重构的元件间耦合，显著提升了波束成形的灵活性和性能。

Method: 利用物理一致性和多端口网络辅助建模，设计并优化 BD-RIS 的传输、反射、混合模式架构，同时考虑了硬件限制如离散阻抗、有损互连、互耦效应等。

Result: BD-RIS 展现出比传统 D-RIS 更广泛的波束成形能力和更高的性能上限，适用于通信、感知和能量传输等多个领域。

Conclusion: BD-RIS 代表了 RIS 技术的一个重大突破，提供了更灵活的波操控方法，并为未来的智能表面技术开辟了新的研究方向和应用前景。

Abstract: Written by its inventors, this first tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BD-RISs) provides the readers with the
basics and fundamental tools necessary to appreciate, understand, and
contribute to this emerging and disruptive technology. Conventional (Diagonal)
RISs (D-RISs) are characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix
$\mathbf{\Theta}$ such that the wave manipulation flexibility of D-RIS is
extremely limited. In contrast, BD-RIS refers to a novel and general framework
for RIS where its scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal (hence, the
``beyond-diagonal'' terminology) and consequently, all entries of
$\mathbf{\Theta}$ can potentially help shaping waves for much higher
manipulation flexibility. This physically means that BD-RIS can artificially
engineer and reconfigure coupling across elements of the surface thanks to
inter-element reconfigurable components which allow waves absorbed by one
element to flow through other elements. Consequently, BD-RIS opens the door to
more general and versatile intelligent surfaces that subsumes existing RIS
architectures as special cases. In this tutorial, we share all the secret sauce
to model, design, and optimize BD-RIS and make BD-RIS transformative in many
different applications. Topics discussed include physics-consistent and
multi-port network-aided modeling; transmitting, reflecting, hybrid, and
multi-sector mode analysis; reciprocal and non-reciprocal architecture designs
and optimal performance-complexity Pareto frontier of BD-RIS; signal
processing, optimization, and channel estimation for BD-RIS; hardware
impairments (discrete-value impedance and admittance, lossy interconnections
and components, wideband effects, mutual coupling) of BD-RIS; benefits and
applications of BD-RIS in communications, sensing, power transfer.

Abstract: This paper investigates a discrete energy state transition model for energy
harvesting (EH) in cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO)
networks. A Markov chain-based stochastic process is conceived to characterize
the temporal evolution of the user equipment (UE) energy level by leveraging
state transition probabilities (STP) based on the energy differential ($\Delta
E$) between the EH and consumed energy within each coherence interval.
Tractable mathematical relationships are derived for the STP cases using a new
stochastic model of non-linear EH, approximated using a Gamma distribution.
This derivation leverages closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of
the harvested energy. To improve the positive STP of the minimum energy UE
among all network UEs, we aim to maximize the $\Delta E$ for this UE using two
power allocation (PA) schemes. The first scheme is a heuristic PA using the
relative channel characteristics to this UE from all access points (APs). The
second scheme is the optimized PA based on the solution of a second-order conic
problem to maximize the $\Delta E$ using a responsive primal-dual interior
point method (PD-IPM) algorithm with modified backtracking line-search,
iterating over multiple PA periods. Our simulation results illustrate that both
the proposed PA schemes enhance the dynamic minimum UE energy level by around
four-fold over full power control, along with the performance improvement
attributed to spatial resource diversification of CF-mMIMO systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对毫米波雷达的专用啁啾信号设计和啁啾分多址（Chirp-DMA）方案，实现了集感知与通信（ISAC）的无干扰并行操作，并通过两种调制方案验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毫米波雷达系统中，啁啾信号缺乏通信功能，可能限制自动驾驶的进一步发展。论文旨在设计一种同时支持感知与通信的集成方案。

Method: 设计了专用啁啾信号以识别空闲资源，提出了Chirp-DMA方案和两种基于MIMO雷达的调制方案（TDM和DDM），并通过仿真验证了DDM方案的性能。

Result: 成功实现了多对毫米波雷达收发器的无干扰ISAC操作，TDM方案支持高通信速率，DDM方案适用于低信噪比环境。

Conclusion: 该研究为V2X中的ISAC提供了可行方案，但需进一步解决实际部署中的挑战以实现更好的自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is reshaping the way humans travel, with millimeter wave
(mmWave) radar playing a crucial role in this transformation to enabe
vehicle-to-everything (V2X). Although chirp is widely used in mmWave radar
systems for its strong sensing capabilities, the lack of integrated
communication functions in existing systems may limit further advancement of
autonomous driving. In light of this, we first design ``dedicated chirps"
tailored for sensing chirp signals in the environment, facilitating the
identification of idle time-frequency resources. Based on these dedicated
chirps, we propose a chirp-division multiple access (Chirp-DMA) scheme,
enabling multiple pairs of mmWave radar transceivers to perform integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) without interference. Subsequently, we propose
two chirp-based delay-Doppler domain modulation schemes that enable each pair
of mmWave radar transceivers to simultaneously sense and communicate within
their respective time-frequency resource blocks. The modulation schemes are
based on different multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar schemes: the
time division multiplexing (TDM)-based scheme offers higher communication
rates, while the Doppler division multiplexing (DDM)-based scheme is suitable
for working in a lower signal-to-noise ratio range. We then validate the
effectiveness of the proposed DDM-based scheme through simulations. Finally, we
present some challenges and issues that need to be addressed to advance ISAC in
V2X for better autonomous driving. Simulation codes are provided to reproduce
the results in this paper:

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个开放的RSS和IMU数据集（OWP-IMU），用于室内定位研究，包含不同环境和速度下的数据，并通过扩展卡尔曼滤波提高了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于RSS的光学无线定位系统缺乏开源数据集，限制了其测试和分析的进展。论文旨在填补这一空白，促进室内定位技术的研究。

Method: 在两个室内环境中（一个有金属柱障碍物，一个无障碍物）收集了RSS、IMU和地面真实数据，采样频率分别为27 Hz、200 Hz和160 Hz。数据收集时使用了不同速度的移动车辆。

Result: 数据集包含超过11万数据点，覆盖80多分钟。基准测试显示，结合IMU数据通过扩展卡尔曼滤波可以显著提高仅基于RSS的定位精度。

Conclusion: OWP-IMU数据集的开源将支持更多室内定位方法的研究，尤其是结合RSS和IMU数据的多传感器融合技术。

Abstract: Received signal strength (RSS)-based optical wireless positioning (OWP)
systems are becoming popular for indoor localization because they are low-cost
and accurate. However, few open-source datasets are available to test and
analyze RSS-based OWP systems. In this paper, we collected RSS values at a
sampling frequency of 27 Hz, inertial measurement unit (IMU) at a sampling
frequency of 200 Hz and the ground truth at a sampling frequency of 160 Hz in
two indoor environments. One environment has no obstacles, and the other has a
metal column as an obstacle to represent a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario.
We recorded data with a vehicle at three different speeds (low, medium and
high). The dataset includes over 110 k data points and covers more than 80 min.
We also provide benchmark tests to show localization performance using only
RSS-based OWP and improve accuracy by combining IMU data via extended kalman
filter. The dataset OWP-IMU is open source1 to support further research on
indoor localization methods.

Motivation: 随着联网设备数量增加和通信流量的激增，快速检测安全问题变得尤为重要，同时设备的异构性也需要轻量化解决方案。

Result: 提出的方法有效减少了复杂处理架构的需求，并在异常检测上表现出色。代码和数据集已开源。

Conclusion: 该图像表示结合无监督学习是处理大规模异构网络流量异常检测的高效方案。

Abstract: Due to the recent increase in the number of connected devices, the need to
promptly detect security issues is emerging. Moreover, the high number of
communication flows creates the necessity of processing huge amounts of data.
Furthermore, the connected devices are heterogeneous in nature, having
different computational capacities. For this reason, in this work we propose an
image-based representation of network traffic which allows to realize a compact
summary of the current network conditions with 1-second time windows. The
proposed representation highlights the presence of anomalies thus reducing the
need for complex processing architectures. Finally, we present an unsupervised
learning approach which effectively detects the presence of anomalies. The code

### [10] [Including the magnitude variability of a signal into the ordinal pattern analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16866)
*Melvyn Tyloo,Joaquín González,Nicolás Rubido*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的Ordinal Patterns方法，通过结合信号幅度的变异性与排列熵，提升了动态行为和睡眠-觉醒状态的表征效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ordinal Patterns方法虽然简单且抗噪，但丢失了信号的幅度信息，限制了其应用。本文旨在弥补这一不足。

Method: 利用被丢弃的信号幅度作为排列熵的补充变量，分析合成信号（如Logistic和Hénon映射）和真实电生理数据。

Result: 结合幅度变异性与排列熵后，对动态行为和睡眠-觉醒状态的表征效果显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于特征工程和AI分类器优化，能提高分类准确性。

Abstract: One of the most popular and innovative methods to analyse signals is by using
Ordinal Patterns (OPs). The OP encoding is based on transforming a (univariate)
signal into a symbolic sequence of OPs, where each OP represents the number of
permutations needed to order a small subset of the signal's magnitudes. This
implies that OPs are conceptually clear, methodologically simple to implement,
robust to noise, and can be applied to short signals. Moreover, they simplify
the statistical analyses that can be carried out on a signal, such as entropy
and complexity quantifications. However, because of the relative ordering,
information about the magnitude of the signal at each timestamp is lost -- this
being one of the major drawbacks in the method. Here, we propose a way to use
the signal magnitudes discarded in the OP encoding as a complementary variable
to its permutation entropy. To illustrate our approach, we analyse synthetic
trajectories from logistic and H{\'e}non maps -- with and without added noise
-- and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from rats in different
sleep-wake states. Our results show that, when complementing the permutation
entropy with the variability in the signal magnitudes, the characterisation of
the dynamical behaviours of the maps and the sleep-wake states is improved.
This implies that our approach can be useful for feature engineering and
improving AI classifiers, where typical machine learning algorithms need
complementary signal features as inputs to improve classification accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文摘要概述了5G技术在URLLC和eMBB应用中的资源分配优化方法，提出了一种基于DRL的分层优化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对5G网络中URLLC和eMBB两类用户的不同需求，解决资源分配的动态优化问题，以满足低延迟和高吞吐量的要求。

Method: 采用基于DRL的分层优化框架，第一层通过拉格朗日函数和actor-critic网络动态分配资源；第二层优化机器人控制增益以确保稳定性。

Result: 该方法实现了通信和控制过程的高效优化，确保了网络资源的有效利用和性能提升。

Conclusion: 分层优化框架在5G网络中成功平衡了URLLC和eMBB的资源分配需求，提升了整体性能。

Abstract: The evolution of 5G wireless technology has revolutionized connectivity,
enabling a diverse range of applications. Among these are critical use cases
such as real time teleoperation, which demands ultra reliable low latency
communications (URLLC) to ensure precise and uninterrupted control, and
enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services, which cater to data-intensive
applications requiring high throughput and bandwidth. In our scenario, there
are two queues, one for eMBB users and one for URLLC users. In teleoperation
tasks, control commands are received in the URLLC queue, where communication
delays occur. The dynamic index (DI) controls the service rate, affecting the
telerobotic (URLLC) queue. A separate queue models eMBB data traffic. Both
queues are managed through network slicing and application delay constraints,
leading to a unified Lagrangian-based Lyapunov optimization for efficient
resource allocation. We propose a DRL based hierarchical optimization framework
that consists of two levels. At the first level, network optimization
dynamically allocates resources for eMBB and URLLC users using a Lagrangian
functional and an actor critic network to balance competing objectives. At the
second level, control optimization finetunes the best gains for robots,
ensuring stability and responsiveness in network conditions. This hierarchical
approach enhances both communication and control processes, ensuring efficient
resource utilization and optimized performance across the network.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文展示了如何通过微调LLaMA类解码器变换器模型，利用LoRA方法高效生成符合标准的ASN.1编码RRC消息，显著提升6G网络中控制平面的AI自主性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大型AI模型（LAMs）集成到6G移动网络中，以实现自主化和智能化的网络操作，特别是在协议设计和控制平面智能方面。

Method: 将RRC消息视为特定领域的语言，采用LoRA方法微调解码器变换器模型，保留ASN.1语法结构并进行字节对编码标记化。

Result: 在3万次现场测试请求-响应对中，8B模型的余弦相似度中位数为0.97，比零样本基线提升了61%，显著提高了RRC的结构和语义保真度。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过增强RAN特定推理能力，LAMs可直接驱动控制平面流程，为AI原生无线标准的未来奠定基础。

Abstract: Integrating large AI models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks promises to
redefine protocol design and control-plane intelligence by enabling autonomous,
cognitive network operations. While industry concepts, such as ETSI's
Experiential Networked Intelligence (ENI), envision LAM-driven agents for
adaptive network slicing and intent-based management, practical implementations
still face challenges in protocol literacy and real-world deployment. This
paper presents an end-to-end demonstration of a LAM that generates
standards-compliant, ASN.1-encoded Radio Resource Control (RRC) messages as
part of control-plane procedures inside a gNB. We treat RRC messaging as a
domain-specific language and fine-tune a decoder-only transformer model (LLaMA
class) using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on RRC messages
linearized to retain their ASN.1 syntactic structure before standard byte-pair
encoding tokenization. This enables combinatorial generalization over RRC
protocol states while minimizing training overhead. On 30k field-test
request-response pairs, our 8 B model achieves a median cosine similarity of
0.97 with ground-truth messages on an edge GPU -- a 61 % relative gain over a
zero-shot LLaMA-3 8B baseline -- indicating substantially improved structural
and semantic RRC fidelity. Overall, our results show that LAMs, when augmented
with Radio Access Network (RAN)-specific reasoning, can directly orchestrate
control-plane procedures, representing a stepping stone toward the AI-native
air-interface paradigm. Beyond RRC emulation, this work lays the groundwork for
future AI-native wireless standards.

Method: 采用NAP方法聚类全层激活分布，改进归一化、分布估计、距离度量及聚类选择，应用于视觉对象识别和无线电接收模型。

Result: 在无线电接收模型中未发现离散概念，而是观察到由SNR形成的连续激活流形，改进的NAP方法提升了分布内外分离效果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了聚类设计和激活流形在解释和调试神经网络行为中的重要性，改进的NAP方法间接验证了聚类质量。

Abstract: Concept discovery in neural networks often targets individual neurons or
human-interpretable features, overlooking distributed layer-wide patterns. We
study the Neural Activation Pattern (NAP) methodology, which clusters
full-layer activation distributions to identify such layer-level concepts.
Applied to visual object recognition and radio receiver models, we propose
improved normalization, distribution estimation, distance metrics, and varied
cluster selection. In the radio receiver model, distinct concepts did not
emerge; instead, a continuous activation manifold shaped by Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR) was observed -- highlighting SNR as a key learned factor,
consistent with classical receiver behavior and supporting physical
plausibility. Our enhancements to NAP improved in-distribution vs.
out-of-distribution separation, suggesting better generalization and indirectly
validating clustering quality. These results underscore the importance of
clustering design and activation manifolds in interpreting and troubleshooting
neural network behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贝叶斯方法因高维矩阵求逆难以扩展至大规模张量，且缺乏高效的秩推断和噪声估计机制。

Method: 利用GAMP避免矩阵求逆，结合EM算法联合推断张量秩和噪声功率。

Result: 在100x100x100秩20的张量实验（20%观测）中，相比现有方法减少82.7%运行时间，精度相当。

Conclusion: CP-GAMP为大规模张量分解提供了高效且可扩展的贝叶斯解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) is a fundamental model for
tensor reconstruction. Although the Bayesian framework allows for principled
uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning, existing
methods do not scale well for large tensors because of high-dimensional matrix
inversions. To this end, we introduce CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian CPD
algorithm. This algorithm leverages generalized approximate message passing
(GAMP) to avoid matrix inversions and incorporates an expectation-maximization
routine to jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Through multiple
experiments, for synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with only 20% elements
observed, the proposed algorithm reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to the
state-of-the-art variational Bayesian CPD method, while maintaining comparable
reconstruction accuracy.

### [15] [Directional Sparsity Based Statistical Channel Estimation for 6D Movable Antenna Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15947)
*Xiaodan Shao,Rui Zhang,Jihong Park,Tony Q. S. Quek,Robert Schober,Xuemin Shen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于6DMA技术的新型方法，利用信道的方向稀疏性提高无线网络容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6DMA技术通过调整天线的3D位置和旋转来优化信道性能，但需要统计信道状态信息（CSI）。本文发现了6DMA信道的方向稀疏性，即用户仅与少数位置-旋转对具有显著信道增益。

Method: 提出了一种基于协方差的算法，通过少量位置-旋转对的信道功率估计，重建所有可能位置-旋转对的平均信道功率，并进一步估计多路径平均功率和到达方向（DOA）向量。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的算法在较低导频开销下，能比现有基准方案更准确地估计信道功率。

Conclusion: 利用方向稀疏性可以有效降低CSI获取的开销，同时提高6DMA系统的性能。

Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an innovative and transformative
technology to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting the 3D positions
and 3D rotations of antennas/surfaces (sub-arrays) based on the channel spatial
distribution. For optimization of the antenna positions and rotations, the
acquisition of statistical channel state information (CSI) is essential for
6DMA systems. In this paper, we unveil for the first time a new
\textbf{\textit{directional sparsity}} property of the 6DMA channels between
the base station (BS) and the distributed users, where each user has
significant channel gains only with a (small) subset of 6DMA position-rotation
pairs, which can receive direct/reflected signals from the user. By exploiting
this property, a covariance-based algorithm is proposed for estimating the
statistical CSI in terms of the average channel power at a small number of 6DMA
positions and rotations. Based on such limited channel power estimation, the
average channel powers for all possible 6DMA positions and rotations in the BS
movement region are reconstructed by further estimating the multi-path average
power and direction-of-arrival (DOA) vectors of all users. Simulation results
show that the proposed directional sparsity-based algorithm can achieve higher
channel power estimation accuracy than existing benchmark schemes, while
requiring a lower pilot overhead.

Conclusion: BD-IRS和优化算法显著提升了ISAC系统的性能，解决了感知与通信的互干扰问题。

Abstract: Beyond diagonal intelligent reflecting surface (BD-IRS) is a new promising
IRS architecture for which the reflection matrix is not limited to the diagonal
structure as for conventional IRS. In this paper, we study a BD-IRS aided
uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where sensing is
performed in a device-based manner. Specifically, we aim to estimate the
unknown and random location of an active target based on its uplink probing
signals sent to a multi-antenna base station (BS) as well as the known prior
distribution information of the target's location. Multiple communication users
also simultaneously send uplink signals, resulting in a challenging mutual
interference issue between sensing and communication. We first characterize the
sensing performance metric by deriving the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB)
of the mean-squared error (MSE) when prior information is available. Then, we
formulate a BD-IRS reflection matrix optimization problem to maximize the
minimum expected achievable rate among the multiple users subject to a
constraint on the PCRB as well as the lossless and reciprocal constraints on
the BD-IRS reflection matrix. The formulated problem is non-convex and
challenging to solve. To tackle this problem, we propose a penalty dual
decomposition (PDD) based algorithm which can find a high-quality suboptimal
solution with polynomial-time complexity. In addition, we propose and optimize
a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based scheme which removes the
sensing-communication mutual interference. Numerical results verify the
effectiveness of the proposed designs and provide useful design insights.

Result: 数值实验表明，该算法设计的基站布局在感知性能上显著优于多种基准方法。

Conclusion: 研究证明，通过优化基站布局可以高效提升网络感知系统的性能，提出的算法为解决非凸优化问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper studies a networked sensing system with multiple base stations
(BSs), which collaboratively sense the unknown and random three-dimensional
(3D) location of a target based on the target-reflected echo signals received
at the BSs. Considering a practical scenario where the target location
distribution is known a priori for exploitation, we aim to design the placement
of the multiple BSs to optimize the networked sensing performance. Firstly, we
characterize the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error
(MSE) in sensing the target's 3D location. Despite its complex form under
networked sensing, we derive its closed-form expression in terms of the BS
locations. Next, we formulate the BS placement optimization problem to minimize
the sensing PCRB, which is non-convex and difficult to solve. By leveraging a
series of equivalent transformations and the iterative inner approximation
method, we devise an algorithm with polynomial-time complexity which is
guaranteed to converge to a solution satisfying the Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT)
conditions of the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed placement
design significantly outperforms various benchmark designs.

Abstract: The emerging demands of sixth-generation wireless networks, such as
ultra-connectivity, native intelligence, and cross-domain convergence, are
bringing renewed focus to cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA)
as a fundamental enabler of scalable, efficient, and intelligent communication
systems. C-NOMA builds on the core benefits of NOMA by leveraging user

on the integration of C-NOMA with key enabling technologies, including radio
frequency energy harvesting, cognitive radio networks, reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces, space-air-ground integrated networks, and integrated
sensing and communication-assisted semantic communication. Foundational
principles and relaying protocols are first introduced to establish the
technical relevance of C-NOMA. Then, a focused investigation is conducted into
protocol-level synergies, architectural models, and deployment strategies
across these technologies. Beyond integration, this article emphasizes the
orchestration of C-NOMA across future application domains such as digital
twins, extended reality, and e-health. In addition, it provides an extensive
and in-depth review of recent literature, categorized by relaying schemes,
system models, performance metrics, and optimization paradigms, including
model-based, heuristic, and AI-driven approaches. Finally, open challenges and
future research directions are outlined, spanning standardization, security,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静电粘附力监测方法依赖笨重且昂贵的传感器，增加了系统复杂性和重量，需要一种低成本、非接触的解决方案。

Method: 利用静电粘附系统产生的周期性声压信号，通过麦克风捕获并分析峰值声压与粘附力之间的关系。

Result: 峰值声压随粘附物体质量、接触面积及驱动电压的频率和幅值增加而增加，成功应用于质量估计和多系统监测。

Conclusion: 该技术为静电粘附末端执行器提供了一种低成本、非接触且多目标的监测方案。

Abstract: Electrostatic adhesion is widely used in mobile robotics, haptics, and
robotic end effectors for its adaptability to diverse substrates and low energy
consumption. Force sensing is important for feedback control, interaction, and
monitoring in the EA system. However, EA force monitoring often relies on bulky
and expensive sensors, increasing the complexity and weight of the entire
system. This paper presents an acoustic-pressure-based method to monitor EA
forces without contacting the adhesion pad. When the EA pad is driven by a
bipolar square-wave voltage to adhere a conductive object, periodic acoustic
pulses arise from the EA system. We employed a microphone to capture these
acoustic pressure signals and investigate the influence of peak pressure
values. Results show that the peak value of acoustic pressure increased with
the mass and contact area of the adhered object, as well as with the amplitude
and frequency of the driving voltage. We applied this technique to mass
estimation of various objects and simultaneous monitoring of two EA systems.
Then, we integrated this technique into an EA end effector that enables
monitoring the change of adhered object mass during transport. The proposed
technique offers a low-cost, non-contact, and multi-object monitoring solution
for EA end effectors in handling tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for jointly calibrating magnetometers and
inertial measurement units, focusing on improving calibration accuracy and
computational efficiency. The proposed method formulates the calibration
problem as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem, treating both the
calibration parameters and orientation trajectory of the sensors as unknowns.
This formulation enables efficient optimization with closed-form derivatives.
The method is compared against two state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
computational complexity and estimation accuracy. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower root mean square error in
calibration parameters while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.
Further validation through real-world experiments confirms the practical
benefits of our approach: it effectively reduces position drift in a magnetic
field-aided inertial navigation system by more than a factor of two on most
datasets. Moreover, the proposed method calibrated 30 magnetometers in less
than 2 minutes. The contributions include a new calibration method, an analysis
of existing methods, and a comprehensive empirical evaluation. Datasets and
algorithms are made publicly available to promote reproducible research.

Abstract: Advancements in AI-driven speech-based applications have transformed diverse
industries ranging from healthcare to customer service. However, the increasing
prevalence of non-native accented speech in global interactions poses
significant challenges for speech-processing systems, which are often trained
on datasets dominated by native speech. This study investigates accented
English speech through articulatory and acoustic analysis, identifying simpler
coordination patterns and higher average pitch than native speech. Using
eigenspectra and Vocal Tract Variable-based coordination features, we establish
an efficient method for quantifying accent strength without relying on
resource-intensive phonetic transcriptions. Our findings provide a new avenue
for research on the impacts of accents on speech intelligibility and offer
insights for developing inclusive, robust speech processing systems that
accommodate diverse linguistic communities.

Abstract: Studies on schizophrenia assessments using deep learning typically treat it
as a classification task to detect the presence or absence of the disorder,
oversimplifying the condition and reducing its clinical applicability. This
traditional approach overlooks the complexity of schizophrenia, limiting its
practical value in healthcare settings. This study shifts the focus to
individual symptom severity estimation using a multimodal approach that
integrates speech, video, and text inputs. We develop unimodal models for each
modality and a multimodal framework to improve accuracy and robustness. By
capturing a more detailed symptom profile, this approach can help in enhancing
diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment, offering a scalable

Abstract: We consider estimating the population covariance matrix when the number of
available samples is less than the size of the observations. The sample
covariance matrix (SCM) being singular, regularization is mandatory in this
case. For this purpose we consider minimizing Stein's loss function and we
investigate a method based on augmenting the partial Cholesky decomposition of
the SCM. We first derive the finite sample optimum estimator which minimizes
the loss for each data realization, then the Oracle estimator which minimizes
the risk, i.e., the average value of the loss. Finally a practical scheme is
presented where the missing part of the Cholesky decomposition is filled. We
conduct a numerical performance study of the proposed method and compare it
with available related methods. In particular we investigate the influence of
the condition number of the covariance matrix as well as of the shape of its
spectrum.
