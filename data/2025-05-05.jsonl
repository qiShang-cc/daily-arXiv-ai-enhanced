Then, the\nbeamforming design subproblem in the BCD-based algorithm becomes a convex power\nallocation subproblem, which can be efficiently solved. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that 1) the CAPA can significantly improve the EE compared to\nconventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs); 2) due to the enhanced spatial\nresolutions, increasing the aperture size of CAPA is not always beneficial for\nEE enhancement in multicast scenarios; and 3) wider user distributions of each\ngroup cause a significant EE degradation of CAPA compared to SPDA."}

Empowered by advanced artificial\nintelligence (AI) technologies, SemCom has achieved significant improvements in\ntransmission quality and efficiency. However, existing SemCom systems either\nrely on training over large datasets and specific channel conditions or suffer\nfrom performance degradation under channel noise when operating in a\ntraining-free manner. To address these issues, we explore the use of generative\ndiffusion models (GDMs) as training-free SemCom systems. Specifically, we\ndesign a semantic encoding and decoding method based on the inversion and\nsampling process of the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which\nintroduces a two-stage forward diffusion process, split between the transmitter\nand receiver to enhance robustness against channel noise. Moreover, we optimize\nsampling steps to compensate for the increased noise level caused by channel\nnoise. We also conduct a brief analysis to provide insights about this design.\nSimulations on the Kodak dataset validate that the proposed system outperforms\nthe existing baseline SemCom systems across various metrics."}

While concepts for higher-order spectral\nanalysis like Brillinger's polyspectra for stationary processes have long been\nintroduced, their applications have been limited probably due to high\ncomputational cost and complexity of implementation. Here we discuss the\ntheoretical background of estimating polyspectra with our open-source\nGPU-accelerated SignaSnap library and highlight its advantages over previous\nimplementations: (i) The calculation of spectra is unprecedentedly based on\nunbiased and consistent estimators that suppress the appearance of false\nstructures in fourth-order spectra. (ii) SignalSnap implements\ncross-correlation spectra for up to four channels. (iii) The spectral estimates\nof SignalSnap have a clear relation to Brillinger's definition of ideal spectra\nof continuous stochastic processes in terms of amplitude and spectral\nresolution. (iv) SignalSnap estimates the variance of each spectral value. We\nshow how polyspectra reveal, e.g., the correlations between different channels\nor the breaking of time-inversion symmetry and discuss how quasi-polyspectra\nuncover the non-stationarity of signals."}

The proposed approach detects subtle skin color\nvariations due to blood flow and compares extracted PR values against reference\nmeasurements from a wearable wristband Empatica E4. We evaluate the impact of\nEulerian Video Magnification (EVM) on signal quality and assess statistical\ndifferences in PR between age groups. Data obtained from 80 recordings from 64\nhealthy subjects covering a PR range of 45-160 bpm are analyzed, and signal\nextraction accuracy is quantified using metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Results show that EVM slightly\nimproves PR estimation accuracy, reducing MAE from 6.48 bpm to 5.04 bpm and\nRMSE from 7.84 bpm to 6.38 bpm. A statistically significant difference is found\nbetween older and younger groups with both video-based and ground truth\nevaluation procedures.

Contrary to conventional single bit quantizers which only\nutilize the transmitted bit to convey information, in our codebook, we use an\nadditional `$\\emptyset$' symbol to encode the event of \\emph{not transmitting}.\nThus, our quantization functions are composed of three decision regions as\nopposed to the conventional two regions. First, we propose an optimum\nquantization method in which the optimum quantization functions are obtained by\ntracking the distributions of the quantization error. However, this method\nrequires a high computational cost and might not be applicable for\nenergy-conserving sensors. Thus, we propose two additional low complexity\nmethods. In the last-bit aware method, three predefined quantization functions\nare available to both devices, and they switch the quantization function based\non the last transmitted bit. With the Gaussian approximation method, we\ncalculate a single quantization function by assuming that the quantization\nerror can be approximated as Gaussian. While previous methods require a\nconstant delay assumption, this method also works for random delay. We observe\nthat all three methods perform similarly in terms of mean-squared error and\ntransmission cost."}
