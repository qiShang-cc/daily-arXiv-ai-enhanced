*Nafize Ishtiaque Hossain,Kundan Saha,Atul Sharma,Sameer Sonkusale*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 一种自供电的植物传感器平台，用于连续监测植物水分和生长，集成了叶片纹身传感器和茎干应变传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发可扩展、自供电的传感器平台，以持续监测植物水分和生长，改善作物管理。

Method: 集成叶片纹身传感器（测量温湿度并收集环境水分能量）和茎干应变传感器（追踪径向生长），均采用无洁净室的卷对卷方法制造。

Result: 纹身传感器可准确估计水分压力赤字10天以上，应变传感器可连续监测生长20天以上，系统能量自主运行。

Conclusion: 该传感器平台具有大规模农业部署潜力，可用于监测非生物胁迫和优化作物管理。

Abstract: We report a scalable, self-powered in planta sensor platform for continuous
monitoring of plant hydration and growth. The system integrates two components
a leaf mounted tattoo sensor for estimating vapor pressure deficit and a
kirigami inspired strain sensor for tracking radial stem growth. Uniquely, the
tattoo sensor serves a dual function measuring temperature and humidity beneath
the leaf surface while simultaneously harvesting power from ambient moisture
via a vanadium pentoxide nanosheet membrane. This moist-electric generator
configuration enables energy-autonomous operation, delivering a power density
of 0.1114 miroW per square cm. The V2O5 based sensor exhibits high sensitivity
to humidity and temperature, enabling accurate VPD estimation for over 10 days
until leaf senescence. The eutectogel based kirigami strain sensor, wrapped
around the stem, offers a gauge factor of 1.5 and immunity to unrelated
mechanical disturbances, allowing continuous growth tracking for more than 20
days. Both sensors are fabricated via cleanroom-free, roll to roll compatible
methods, underscoring their potential for large-scale agricultural deployment
to monitor abiotic stress and improve crop management.

*Jinshuai Gu,Zenghui Lin,Jingying Ma,Jingyu Wang,Linyan Zhang,Rui Bai,Zelin Tu,Youyou Jiang,Donglin Xie,Yuxi Zhou,Guoli Liu,Shenda Hong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究通过AI模型（CTGage）从CTG时间序列预测胎儿生物年龄，并利用年龄差（CTGage-gap）作为新生物标志物，以评估未来妊娠不良结局的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CTG在预测未来妊娠不良结局方面的潜力，填补现有技术主要关注胎儿当前状态的空白。

Method: 利用61,140份CTG记录，采用1D卷积神经网络和分布对齐的增强回归技术开发CTGage模型，并按年龄差分组比较不良结局发生率。

Result: CTGage的平均绝对误差为10.91天，高风险组（低估或高估组）的不良妊娠结局发生率显著高于正常组。

Conclusion: AI驱动的CTGage可作为非侵入性、易获取的数字生物标志物，预测未来妊娠不良结局潜力显著。

Abstract: Cardiotocography (CTG) is a low-cost, non-invasive fetal health assessment
technique used globally, especially in underdeveloped countries. However, it is
currently mainly used to identify the fetus's current status (e.g., fetal
acidosis or hypoxia), and the potential of CTG in predicting future adverse
pregnancy outcomes has not been fully explored. We aim to develop an AI-based
model that predicts biological age from CTG time series (named CTGage), then
calculate the age gap between CTGage and actual age (named CTGage-gap), and use
this gap as a new digital biomarker for future adverse pregnancy outcomes. The
CTGage model is developed using 61,140 records from 11,385 pregnant women,
collected at Peking University People's Hospital between 2018 and 2022. For
model training, a structurally designed 1D convolutional neural network is
used, incorporating distribution-aligned augmented regression technology. The
CTGage-gap is categorized into five groups: < -21 days (underestimation group),
-21 to -7 days, -7 to 7 days (normal group), 7 to 21 days, and > 21 days
(overestimation group). We further defined the underestimation group and
overestimation group together as the high-risk group. We then compare the
incidence of adverse outcomes and maternal diseases across these groups. The
average absolute error of the CTGage model is 10.91 days. When comparing the
overestimation group with the normal group, premature infants incidence is
5.33% vs. 1.42% (p < 0.05) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence is
31.93% vs. 20.86% (p < 0.05). When comparing the underestimation group with the
normal group, low birth weight incidence is 0.17% vs. 0.15% (p < 0.05) and
anaemia incidence is 37.51% vs. 34.74% (p < 0.05). Artificial
intelligence-derived CTGage can predict the future risk of adverse pregnancy
outcomes and hold potential as a novel, non-invasive, and easily accessible
digital biomarker.

### [3] [InWaveSR: Topography-Aware Super-Resolution Network for Internal Solitary Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14243)
*Xinjie Wang,Zhongrui Li,Peng Han,Chunxin Yuan,Jiexin Xu,Zhiqiang Wei,Jie Nie*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的时空超分辨率模型InWaveSR，用于从低分辨率数据中生成高分辨率数据，特别是在处理内孤立波(ISWs)时表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测数据分辨率不足限制了其有效利用，亟需一种能够高效提升分辨率的方法。

Method: 基于物理约束的深度学习框架，结合Navier-Stokes方程、HF-ResBlock组件（注意力机制与快速傅里叶变换）以及边缘采样和数值预处理方法。

Result: 在ISW观测数据测试中，PSNR达到36.2，优于传统插值方法和先前神经网络。

Conclusion: InWaveSR在提升ISW数据分辨率方面具有显著优势，展示了其高性能和可靠性。

Abstract: The effective utilization of observational data is frequently hindered by
insufficient resolution. To address this problem, we present a new
spatio-temporal super-resolution (STSR) model, called InWaveSR. It is built on
a deep learning framework with physical restrictions and can efficiently
generate high-resolution data from low-resolution input, especially for data
featuring internal solitary waves (ISWs). To increase generality and
interpretation, the model InWaveSR uses the primitive Navier-Stokes equations
as the constraint, ensuring that the output results are physically consistent.
In addition, the proposed model incorporates an HF-ResBlock component that
combines the attention mechanism and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method to
improve the performance of the model in capturing high-frequency
characteristics. Simultaneously, in order to enhance the adaptability of the
model to complicated bottom topography, an edge sampling and numerical
pre-processing method are carried out to optimize the training process. On
evaluations using the in-situ observational ISW data, the proposed InWaveSR
achieved a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) score of 36.2, higher than those
of the traditional interpolation method and the previous neural network. This
highlights its significant superiority over traditional methods, demonstrating
its excellent performance and reliability in high-resolution ISW
reconstruction.

### [4] [Conditional Nearest Level Modulation for Improved Switching Dynamics in Asymmetric Multilevel Converters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14402)
*Jinshui Zhang,Angel V Peterchev,Stefan M Goetz*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种条件最近电平调制（cNLM）方法，解决了不对称多电平电路中因输出电平过多导致的问题，显著改善了输出质量并降低了开关频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不对称多电平电路在清洁能源等领域有广泛应用，但其模块电压差异导致输出电平数量激增，传统方法（如NLM）会引发过多的晶体管开关和电压尖峰。

Method: 提出cNLM方法，通过引入数学惩罚模型来调节开关动态，并设计了针对不同功能的变体（如强制最小开关间隔）。

Result: 实验验证表明，cNLM将总输出失真从66.3%降低到15.1%，开关频率仅为原始NLM的8%。

Conclusion: cNLM显著提升了不对称多电平电路的性能，适用于高精度输出需求的应用场景。

Abstract: Modular multilevel converters have promising applications in clean energy,
electric vehicles, and biomedical instrumentation, but need many modules to
achieve fine output granularity, particularly of the voltage. Asymmetric
multilevel circuits introduce differences in module voltages so that the
quantity of output levels grows exponentially with the number of modules.
Nearest-level modulation (NLM) is preferred over carrier-based methods in
asymmetric circuits for its simplicity. However, the large number of output
levels can overwhelm NLM and cause excessive transistor switching on some
modules and output voltage spikes. We propose a conditional nearest-level
modulation (cNLM) by incorporating mathematical penalty models to regulate
switching dynamics. This approach improves output quality and reduces switching
rates. Additionally, we present cNLM variations tailored for specific
functions, such as enforcing a minimum switching interval. Experimental
validation on an asymmetric multilevel prototype demonstrates that cNLM reduces
the total output distortion from 66.3% to 15.1% while cutting the switching
rate to just 8% of the original NLM.

Abstract: We develop a framework for non-invasive volumetric indoor airflow estimation
from a single viewpoint using background-oriented schlieren (BOS) measurements
and physics-informed reconstruction. Our framework utilizes a light projector
that projects a pattern onto a target back-wall and a camera that observes
small distortions in the light pattern. While the single-view BOS tomography
problem is severely ill-posed, our proposed framework addresses this using: (1)
improved ray tracing, (2) a physics-based light rendering approach and loss
formulation, and (3) a physics-based regularization using a physics-informed
neural network (PINN) to ensure that the reconstructed airflow is consistent
with the governing equations for buoyancy-driven flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑机接口中神经信号不稳定和实时植入应用中的内存限制问题。

Method: 使用错误调制的Hebbian更新、快/慢痕迹整合和自适应学习率控制，仅需O(1)内存。

Result: 在两个灵长类数据集上解码准确性媲美BPTT方法（Pearson R≥0.63和R≥0.81），内存减少28-35%，收敛更快。

Conclusion: 该技术适用于资源受限的可植入BCI系统，实现高效内存和持续自适应的神经解码。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces face challenges from neural signal instability and
memory constraints for real-time implantable applications. We introduce an
online SNN decoder using local three-factor learning rules with dual-timescale
eligibility traces that avoid backpropagation through time while maintaining
competitive performance. Our approach combines error-modulated Hebbian updates,
fast/slow trace consolidation, and adaptive learning rate control, requiring
only O(1) memory versus O(T) for BPTT methods. Evaluations on two primate
datasets achieve comparable decoding accuracy (Pearson $R \geq 0.63$ Zenodo, $R
\geq 0.81$ MC Maze) with 28-35% memory reduction and faster convergence than
BPTT-trained SNNs. Closed-loop simulations with synthetic neural populations
demonstrate adaptation to neural disruptions and learning from scratch without
offline calibration. This work enables memory-efficient, continuously adaptive
neural decoding suitable for resource-constrained implantable BCI systems.

### [7] [Secure Blind Graph Signal Recovery and Adversary Detection Using Smoothness Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14449)
*Mahdi Shamsi,Hadi Zayyani,Hasan Abu Hilal,Mohammad Salman*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种安全的盲图信号恢复（GSR）算法，能够检测敌对节点，适用于存在测量噪声和虚假数据注入（FDI）的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在未知敌对节点数量和位置的情况下，恢复图信号的挑战性问题。

Method: 基于差分平滑度的统计测量检测敌对节点，并通过平滑度最大化的变体进行GSR。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在信号恢复方面显著优于中值GSR算法和其他竞争方法。

Conclusion: 该算法是一种安全且高效的GSR解决方案，尤其适用于敌对节点存在的场景。

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a secure blind Graph Signal Recovery (GSR)
algorithm that can detect adversary nodes. Some unknown adversaries are assumed
to be injecting false data at their respective nodes in the graph. The number
and location of adversaries are not known in advance and the goal is to recover
the graph signal in the presence of measurement noise and False Data Injection
(FDI) caused by the adversaries. Consequently, the proposed algorithm would be
a perfect candidate to solve this challenging problem. Moreover, due to the
presence of malicious nodes, the proposed method serves as a secure GSR
algorithm. For adversary detection, a statistical measure based on differential
smoothness is used. Specifically, the difference between the current observed
smoothness and the average smoothness excluding the corresponding node. This
genuine statistical approach leads to an effective and low-complexity adversary
detector. In addition, following malicious node detection, the GSR is performed
using a variant of smoothness maximization, which is solved efficiently as a
fractional optimization problem using a Dinkelbach's algorithm. Analysis of the
detector, which determines the optimum threshold of the detector is also
presented. Simulation results show a significant improvement of the proposed
method in signal recovery compared to the median GSR algorithm and other
competing methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了6G时代下物联网设备的非正交免授权随机接入（GF-RA）问题，针对两种不同类型的流量（事件触发和状态更新）设计了优化方案，提出了一种基于信息年龄的自动编码器（A-PIAAE）来同时提高检测成功率和信息时效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G的到来，物联网流量变得复杂多样，现有GF-RA研究主要关注用户检测和数据恢复的准确性，忽略了流量异质性。本文旨在解决这一问题，同时优化事件触发设备（ADs）的检测成功率和状态更新设备（MDs）的信息时效性。

Method: 论文首先分析了基于信息年龄的随机接入方案，优化了接入参数以最小化MDs的平均信息年龄（AoI）。随后设计了一种基于年龄的先验信息辅助自动编码器（A-PIAAE），结合学习的导频减少非正交导频间的干扰。在解码器中，提出了基于AoI的先验信息迭代收缩阈值算法（LISTA-AGE）以增强用户检测。

Result: 理论分析表明A-PIAAE具有更好的收敛性能。实验验证了该方法在降低MDs平均AoI和提高ADs检测成功率方面的优势。

Conclusion: 通过结合信息年龄优化和非正交接入技术，论文提出的A-PIAAE方法为异构物联网流量提供了高效的解决方案，验证了其在提升系统性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: With the arrival of 6G, the Internet of Things (IoT) traffic is becoming more
and more complex and diverse. To meet the diverse service requirements of IoT
devices, massive machine-type communications (mMTC) becomes a typical scenario,
and more recently, grant-free random access (GF-RA) presents a promising
direction due to its low signaling overhead. However, existing GF-RA research
primarily focuses on improving the accuracy of user detection and data
recovery, without considering the heterogeneity of traffic. In this paper, we
investigate a non-orthogonal GF-RA scenario where two distinct types of traffic
coexist: event-triggered traffic with alarm devices (ADs), and status update
traffic with monitor devices (MDs). The goal is to simultaneously achieve high
detection success rates for ADs and high information timeliness for MDs. First,
we analyze the age-based random access scheme and optimize the access
parameters to minimize the average age of information (AoI) of MDs. Then, we
design an age-based prior information aided autoencoder (A-PIAAE) to jointly
detect active devices, together with learned pilots used in GF-RA to reduce
interference between non-orthogonal pilots. In the decoder, an Age-based
Learned Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (LISTA-AGE) utilizing the
AoI of MDs as the prior information is proposed to enhance active user
detection. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the proposed A-PIAAE
has better convergence performance. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of
the proposed method in reducing the average AoI of MDs and improving the
successful detection rate of ADs.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel physics-informed deep learning architecture
for predicting radio maps over lunar terrain. Our approach integrates a
physics-based lunar terrain generator, which produces realistic topography
informed by publicly available NASA data, with a ray-tracing engine to create a
high-fidelity dataset of radio propagation scenarios. Building on this dataset,
we introduce a triplet-UNet architecture, consisting of two standard UNets and
a diffusion network, to model complex propagation effects. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing deep learning approaches on
our terrain dataset across various metrics.

*Tian-Yu Xiang,Zheng Lei,Xiao-Hu Zhou,Xiao-Liang Xie,Shi-Qi Liu,Mei-Jiang Gui,Hong-Yun Ou,Xin-Zheng Huang,Xin-Yi Fu,Zeng-Guang Hou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于任务导向学习的EEG去噪框架，无需干净参考信号，仅依赖任务标签即可自动去噪，实验表现优越且算法通用性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG去噪方法需要人工干预或干净参考信号，限制了其应用，因此研究提出了无需干净参考信号的自动去噪框架。

Method: 通过盲源分离技术分解EEG信号，学习型选择器为每个成分赋予保留概率，利用下游代理任务的损失函数优化选择器。

Result: 在三个数据集上实验表明，任务性能提升2.56%，信噪比提升0.82dB，且框架适用于多种分解技术和网络架构。

Conclusion: 该任务是实用的EEG去噪解决方案，对神经科学研究和EEG交互系统具有潜在意义。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) denoising methods typically depend on manual
intervention or clean reference signals. This work introduces a task-oriented
learning framework for automatic EEG denoising that uses only task labels
without clean reference signals. EEG recordings are first decomposed into
components based on blind source separation (BSS) techniques. Then, a
learning-based selector assigns a retention probability to each component, and
the denoised signal is reconstructed as a probability-weighted combination. A
downstream proxy-task model evaluates the reconstructed signal, with its task
loss supervising the selector in a collaborative optimization scheme that
relies solely on task labels, eliminating the need for clean EEG references.
Experiments on three datasets spanning two paradigms and multiple noise
conditions show consistent gains in both task performance (accuracy:
$2.56\%\uparrow$) and standard signal-quality metrics (signal-to-noise-ratio:
$0.82$\,dB\,$\uparrow$). Further analyses demonstrate that the task-oriented
learning framework is algorithm-agnostic, as it accommodates diverse
decomposition techniques and network backbones for both the selector and the
proxy model. These promising results indicate that the proposed task-oriented
learning framework is a practical EEG denoising solution with potential
implications for neuroscience research and EEG-based interaction systems.

*Koya Sato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯过程（GP）的无线电地图构建的预测性速率选择框架，能够有效应对位置不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线电地图是提升6G网络通信效率的有效工具，但现有研究常假设位置信息完美无噪，而实际上位置信息存在误差，影响了系统的可靠性。

Method: 通过引入噪声输入高斯过程（NIGP），将位置噪声视为额外输出噪声，并利用泰勒近似处理目标函数。

Result: 数值结果显示，基于NIGP的设计相比纯GP实现了更可靠的传输速率选择，且吞吐量高于基于路径损耗的速率选择方法。

Conclusion: NIGP方法能够有效提升位置不确定性下的通信系统可靠性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a predictive rate-selection framework based on Gaussian
process (GP)-based radio map construction that is robust to location
uncertainty. Radio maps are a promising tool for improving communication
efficiency in 6G networks. Although they enable the design of location-based
maximum transmission rates by exploiting statistical channel information,
existing discussions often assume perfect (i.e., noiseless) location
information during channel sensing. Since such information must be obtained
from positioning systems such as global navigation satellite systems, it
inevitably involves positioning errors; this location uncertainty can degrade
the reliability of radio map-based wireless systems. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce the noisy-input GP (NIGP), which treats location noise as additional
output noise by applying a Taylor approximation of the function of interest.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NIGP-based design achieves more
reliable transmission-rate selection than pure GP and yields higher throughput
than path loss-based rate selection.

Conclusion: LLM4MG在6G车联网中表现优异，高精度多路径生成对系统设计至关重要，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Based on Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), a large language model (LLM) is
adapted for multipath generation (LLM4MG) for the first time. Considering a
typical sixth-generation (6G) vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario, a new
multi-modal sensing-communication dataset is constructed, named SynthSoM-V2I,
including channel multipath information, millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensory
data, RGB-D images, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. Based
on the SynthSoM-V2I dataset, the proposed LLM4MG leverages Large Language Model
Meta AI (LLaMA) 3.2 for multipath generation via multi-modal sensory data. The
proposed LLM4MG aligns the multi-modal feature space with the LLaMA semantic
space through feature extraction and fusion networks. To further achieve
general knowledge transfer from the pre-trained LLaMA for multipath generation
via multi-modal sensory data, the low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
parameter-efficient fine-tuning and propagation-aware prompt engineering are
exploited. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LLM4MG outperforms
conventional deep learning-based methods in terms of line-of-sight
(LoS)/non-LoS (NLoS) classification with accuracy of 92.76%, multipath
power/delay generation precision with normalized mean square error (NMSE) of
0.099/0.032, and cross-vehicular traffic density (VTD), cross-band, and
cross-scenario generalization. The utility of the proposed LLM4MG is validated
by real-world generalization. The necessity of high-precision multipath
generation for system design is also demonstrated by channel capacity
comparison.

Motivation: 在多人说话环境中，从EEG解码注意力焦点对神经导向助听器应用很重要。现有方法需要校准会话和带标签数据，而无监督方法存在初始化偏差或高计算复杂度的问题。

Conclusion: 本文方法为无监督AAD提供了高效且性能稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Decoding the attended speaker in a multi-speaker environment from
electroencephalography (EEG) has attracted growing interest in recent years,
with neuro-steered hearing devices as a driver application. Current approaches
typically rely on ground-truth labels of the attended speaker during training,
necessitating calibration sessions for each user and each EEG set-up to achieve
optimal performance. While unsupervised self-adaptive auditory attention
decoding (AAD) for stimulus reconstruction has been developed to eliminate the
need for labeled data, it suffers from an initialization bias that can
compromise performance. Although an unbiased variant has been proposed to
address this limitation, it introduces substantial computational complexity
that scales with data size. This paper presents three computationally efficient
alternatives that achieve comparable performance, but with a significantly
lower and constant computational cost. The code for the proposed algorithms is
available at https://github.com/YYao-42/Unsupervised_AAD.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了三种混合非正交多址（H-NOMA）方案在随机信道增益排序下的性能，推导了其性能低于传统OMA的闭式表达式，并通过仿真验证了分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有H-NOMA研究通常假设固定信道增益排序，而实际信道增益是随机的，本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 分析了三种H-NOMA方案（FSIC、HSIC-NPA、HSIC-PA），推导了其性能低于OMA的概率闭式表达式，并进行了高信噪比下的渐近分析。

Result: 仿真结果验证了理论分析，显示H-NOMA在不同信噪比场景下的性能表现。

Conclusion: 研究为下一代无线系统中H-NOMA的部署提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA), which combines the advantages
of pure NOMA and conventional OMA organically, has emerged as a highly
promising multiple access technology for future wireless networks. Recent
studies have proposed various H-NOMA systems by employing different successive
interference cancellation (SIC) methods for the NOMA transmission phase.
However, existing analyses typically assume a fixed channel gain order between
paired users, despite the fact that channel coefficients follow random
distribution, leading to their magnitude relationships inherently stochastic
and time varying. This paper analyzes the performance of three H-NOMA schemes
under stochastic channel gain ordering: a) fixed order SIC (FSIC) aided H-NOMA
scheme; b) hybrid SIC with non-power adaptation (HSIC-NPA) aided H-NOMA scheme;

### [15] [Sampling Method for Generalized Graph Signals with Pre-selected Vertices via DC Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14836)
*Keitaro Yamashita,Kazuki Naganuma,Shunsuke Ono*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于广义采样理论的图信号顶点灵活采样方法，通过优化问题设计采样算子，解决现有方法无法结合先验知识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然能控制活动顶点数量，但无法结合已知顶点必须或禁止采样的先验知识。

Method: 将算子设计问题转化为差分凸优化（DC）问题，利用核范数和顶点选择的DC惩罚，开发基于双近端梯度DC算法的求解器。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在多样图信号模型和真实数据中恢复精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效结合先验知识，提高恢复精度。

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for vertex-wise flexible sampling of a broad
class of graph signals, designed to attain the best possible recovery based on
the generalized sampling theory. This is achieved by designing a sampling
operator by an optimization problem, which is inherently non-convex, as the
best possible recovery imposes a rank constraint. An existing method for
vertex-wise flexible sampling is able to control the number of active vertices
but cannot incorporate prior knowledge of mandatory or forbidden vertices. To
address these challenges, we formulate the operator design as a problem that
handles a constraint of the number of active vertices and prior knowledge on
specific vertices for sampling, mandatory inclusion or exclusion. We
transformed this constrained problem into a difference-of-convex (DC)
optimization problem by using the nuclear norm and a DC penalty for vertex
selection. To solve this, we develop a convergent solver based on the general
double-proximal gradient DC algorithm. The effectiveness of our method is
demonstrated through experiments on various graph signal models, including
real-world data, showing superior performance in the recovery accuracy by
comparing to existing methods.

*Flor Ortiz,Eva Lagunas*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种结合预计算路由表和深度Q学习（DQL）后备机制的混合策略，用于下一代卫星轨道（NGSO）星座的动态路由，以提高性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全基于强化学习（RL）的方案虽然能适应拓扑动态变化，但复杂性高、收敛时间长，且在重负载下性能不稳定。

Method: 在正常情况下使用确定性表查找，仅在链路不可用或拥塞时选择性激活DQL代理。

Result: 仿真结果表明，在大规模NGSO网络中，混合方法相比纯RL基线实现了更高的包传递率、更低的端到端延迟、更短的平均跳数和更高的吞吐量。

Conclusion: 混合路由是延迟敏感卫星宽带服务的可扩展且弹性强的有效解决方案。

Abstract: This letter investigates dynamic routing in Next-Generation Satellite Orbit
(NGSO) constellations and proposes a hybrid strategy that combines precomputed
routing tables with a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) fallback mechanism. While fully
RL-based schemes offer adaptability to topology dynamics, they often suffer
from high complexity, long convergence times, and unstable performance under
heavy traffic. In contrast, the proposed framework exploits deterministic table
lookups under nominal conditions and selectively activates the DQL agent only
when links become unavailable or congested. Simulation results in large-scale
NGSO networks show that the hybrid approach consistently achieves higher packet
delivery ratio, lower end-to-end delay, shorter average hop count, and improved
throughput compared to a pure RL baseline. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of hybrid routing as a scalable and resilient solution for
delay-sensitive satellite broadband services

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于级联累加器的高效计算时间索引加权和的新方法，减少了乘法操作和存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统直接计算方法需要大量乘法操作，而基于查找表或信号反转的方法需要存储整个数据块。这些方法在大规模数据下效率低下。

Method: 利用级联累加器的特性，将乘法操作减少为仅需K+1次常数乘法，无需存储整个数据块。

Result: 提出的方法显著降低了计算复杂度和存储需求，适用于实时处理系统。

Conclusion: 新方法为实时高效计算时间索引加权和提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This letter presents a novel approach for \mbox{efficiently} computing
time-index powered weighted sums of the form $\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} n^{K} v[n]$
using cascaded accumulators. Traditional direct computation requires
$K{\times}N$ general multiplications, which become prohibitive for large $N$,
while alternative strategies based on lookup tables or signal reversal require
storing entire data blocks. By exploiting accumulator properties, the proposed
method eliminates the need for such storage and reduces the multiplicative cost
to only $K{+}1$ constant multiplications, enabling efficient real-time
implementation. The approach is particularly useful when such sums need to be
efficiently computed in sample-by-sample processing systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于DoRF的新框架，通过多天线AP抑制噪声并选择最具信息量的天线，提升了Wi-Fi手势识别的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Wi-Fi CSI信号因异步AP时钟和环境噪声导致的HAR性能受限问题。

Method: 利用多天线AP基于DoRF拟合误差抑制噪声并筛选天线，减少不一致性。

Result: 在小型手势数据集上显著提升了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为现实场景中的鲁棒感知部署提供了新途径。

Abstract: With the IEEE 802.11bf Task Group introducing amendments to the WLAN standard
for advanced sensing, interest in using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
for remote sensing has surged. Recent findings indicate that learning a unified
three-dimensional motion representation through Doppler Radiance Fields (DoRFs)
derived from CSI significantly improves the generalization capabilities of
Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR). Despite this progress, CSI
signals remain affected by asynchronous access point (AP) clocks and additive
noise from environmental and hardware sources. Consequently, even with existing
preprocessing techniques, both the CSI data and Doppler velocity projections
used in DoRFs are still susceptible to noise and outliers, limiting HAR
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for
multi-antenna APs to suppress noise and identify the most informative antennas
based on DoRF fitting errors, which capture inconsistencies among Doppler
velocity projections. Experimental results on a challenging small-scale hand
gesture recognition dataset demonstrate that the proposed DoRF-guided
Wi-Fi-based HAR approach significantly improves generalization capability,
paving the way for robust real-world sensing deployments.

Motivation: 随着接入点天线的增加，传统远场传播假设不再适用，本文旨在解决混合近远场信道环境下的活动检测挑战。

Method: 提出了一种分布式算法，各接入点进行本地活动检测，并向中央处理单元交换结果，从而降低计算复杂性和通信开销。

Result: 理论分析表明增加近场信道比例可提升检测性能，仿真结果验证了算法的优越性。

Conclusion: 所提算法不仅能覆盖单细胞和无细胞系统的特殊情况，还保证了收敛性，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: A great amount of endeavor has recently been devoted to activity detection
for massive machine-type communications in cell-free multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, as the number of antennas at the
access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the
near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional
assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this
challenge, this paper establishes a covariance-based formulation that can
effectively capture the statistical property of hybrid near-far field channels.
Based on this formulation, we theoretically reveal that increasing the
proportion of near-field channels enhances the detection performance.
Furthermore, we propose a distributed algorithm, where each AP performs local
activity detection and only exchanges the detection results to the central
processing unit, thus significantly reducing the computational complexity and
the communication overhead. Not only with convergence guarantee, the proposed
algorithm is unified in the sense that it can handle single-cell or cell-free
systems with either near-field or far-field devices as special cases.
Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses and demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了AEGIS框架，通过自动化生成和标识多智能体系统中的错误，填补了缺乏大规模多样性错误数据集的空白，并在多种学习范式下验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统（MAS）的自主性和复杂性增加，亟需理解其错误模式以确保可靠性与安全性，但现有研究受限于缺乏大规模且多样化的错误标注数据集。

Method: 提出AEGIS框架，通过系统性地注入可控且可追踪的错误到成功轨迹中，利用基于LLM的上下文感知自适应操纵器生成丰富的错误数据集，并在监督微调、强化学习和对比学习三种范式下进行验证。

Result: 实验表明，基于AEGIS数据训练的模型在所有三种学习范式下均取得显著提升，部分微调模型的性能甚至优于规模大得多的专有系统。

Conclusion: AEGIS框架填补了多智能体系统错误数据集的空白，为开发更鲁棒且可解释的系统提供了关键资源。

Abstract: As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex,
understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and
safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack
of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and
\textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically
injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful
trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved
using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs
sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce
specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by
exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task:
Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our
comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve
substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several
of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior
to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated
data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and
interpretable multi-agent systems. Our project website is available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶框架在运动规划中依赖隐式学习的 BEV 特征，缺乏对风险和先验的显式建模，影响了安全性和可解释性。

Method: FlowDrive 提出基于物理可解释的能量流场（如风险势能和车道吸引力场）显式编码先验信息，并结合条件扩散规划器解耦意图预测和轨迹优化。

Result: 在 NAVSIM v2 基准测试中，EPDMS 达到 86.3，安全性和规划质量均超越基线。

Conclusion: FlowDrive 通过显式流场建模和任务解耦，实现了更安全、可解释且性能优越的端到端自动驾驶规划。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images
to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning,
autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by
geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft,
rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic
priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features
learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance
priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose
FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable
energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to
encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware
features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as
interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples
motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion
planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing
multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that
FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3,
surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality. The project is

Motivation: 解决机器人之间无需通信或集中控制，仅通过接触力协调运输不可抓取物体的挑战性场景。

Method: 采用分层策略架构，分离基础运动和手臂控制，提出星座奖励统一位置和方向跟踪，强制刚性接触行为。

Result: 在仿真实验中，2-10个机器人能稳定运输不同几何形状和重量的物体，并在轻量物体上实现仿真到现实的迁移。

Conclusion: 通过奖励设计和训练课程，机器人能够在不明确机械约束的情况下实现协调，且支持任意规模团队无需重新训练。

Abstract: We study decentralized cooperative transport using teams of N-quadruped
robots with arm that must pinch, lift, and move ungraspable objects through
physical contact alone. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid mechanical
coupling between robots and objects, we address the more challenging setting
where mechanically independent robots must coordinate through contact forces
alone without any communication or centralized control. To this end, we employ
a hierarchical policy architecture that separates base locomotion from arm
control, and propose a constellation reward formulation that unifies position
and orientation tracking to enforce rigid contact behavior. The key insight is
encouraging robots to behave as if rigidly connected to the object through
careful reward design and training curriculum rather than explicit mechanical
constraints. Our approach enables coordination through shared policy parameters
and implicit synchronization cues - scaling to arbitrary team sizes without
retraining. We show extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate robust
transport across 2-10 robots on diverse object geometries and masses, along
with sim2real transfer results on lightweight objects.

RobotEra XHand, two widely used research platforms. LeFranX delivers a
seamless, end-to-end workflow from data collection to real-world policy
deployment. We validate our system by collecting a public dataset of 100 expert
demonstrations and use it to successfully fine-tune state-of-the-art visuomotor
policies. We provide our open-source framework, implementation, and dataset to
accelerate IL research for the robotics community.

Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous

models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a
diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL
policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a

prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that
diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in
sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1

Motivation: MARL在机器人应用中面临高维连续动作空间和复杂奖励设计的挑战，而人类通过阶段性学习实现复杂协调。

Result: CRAFT在多四足机器人导航和双臂操作任务中表现出学习复杂协调行为的能力，并在硬件实验中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: CRAFT通过基础模型的推理能力，为多机器人协调任务提供了有效的学习框架。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for
learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to
robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint
action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent
to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination
through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built
upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching
Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot
coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of
foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT
automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of
subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what
follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and
refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement
loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation
tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In
addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware
experiments.

TL;DR: RLBind提出了一种两阶段对抗不变跨模态对齐框架，用于增强统一多模态嵌入的鲁棒性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态编码器在机器人感知中具有潜力，但视觉分支易受对抗性和自然干扰影响，需提升鲁棒性。

Method: RLBind分两阶段：1) 无监督微调强化视觉编码器；2) 利用跨模态对应最小化特征差异并强制类间分布对齐。

Result: 实验表明，RLBind在干净数据和对抗干扰下的性能均优于基线方法，且未牺牲泛化能力。

Conclusion: RLBind为机器人多传感器感知提供了更安全的解决方案，适用于导航和操作等场景。

Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into
a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception
and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to
adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for
safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within
CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding
modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a
two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust
unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on
clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages
cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between
clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise
distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,
Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the
LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy
and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without
sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer
multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,
and other autonomy settings.

Motivation: 解决现有系统中手势仅对应固定命令或单机器人动作的问题，提升异构机器人团队的协作效率和用户体验。

Result: 实现无需用户明确指定目标或命令的上下文感知自适应控制，支持动态环境中可扩展、灵活的用户友好协作。

Conclusion: GestOS 通过智能任务分配和语义手势解析，显著提升了异构机器人团队的协作效率和适应性。

Abstract: We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of
heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed
commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically
and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their
capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system
combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM)
reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which
the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot
selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the
most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware,
adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or
commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent
orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly
collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于距离的CBF方法反应滞后，难以在复杂场景中实现实时安全导航，需要一种更主动且高效的解决方案。

Method: 将3DGS转换为闭合形式的前向碰撞锥并嵌入QP中，利用解析几何简化计算；通过Minkowski和扩展适用于机器人物理尺寸。

Result: 在包含170k个Splat的大场景中，规划时间减少3倍，轨迹更平滑且安全水平不变。

Conclusion: 该方法无需高阶CBF扩展，适用于复杂环境下的实时导航，尤其适合空间机器人等领域。

Abstract: We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian
Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a
first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program
(QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a
continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both
simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to
activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone
CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby
produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We
validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats,
where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly
decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while
maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic,
requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to
robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the
splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time
navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including
space robotics and satellite systems.

Conclusion: LEGO框架在多智能体强化学习中表现出强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为复杂决策任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major
challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks,
simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures
often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration
rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address
these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural
Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL
algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture
permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers,
canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous
representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on
cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong
baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO
demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.

Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored
continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within
known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a
private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's
reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,
human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the
representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that
Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL)
toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and
distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of
deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike
the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief
that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a
KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar
informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and
compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In
real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV)
navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success
with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.

### [31] [Learning Discrete Abstractions for Visual Rearrangement Tasks Using Vision-Guided Graph Coloring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14460)
*Abhiroop Ajith,Constantinos Chamzas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出一种直接从视觉数据中发现抽象结构的方法，用于机器人规划任务，并通过仿真实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过抽象思维高效解决问题，而机器人通常依赖手工设计的抽象结构，限制了扩展性。直接从视觉数据中自动化发现抽象结构可以提升规划的扩展性和实用性。

Method: 结合结构约束和注意力引导的视觉距离，提出一种诱导离散图结构抽象的方法，适用于重排任务。该方法利用问题的二分结构，将视觉嵌入和结构约束统一起来。

Result: 在仿真中的两个重排任务上进行评估，结果显示该方法能识别有意义的抽象结构，支持高效规划，且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够从视觉数据中自主发现抽象结构，为机器人规划提供支持，且在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics.
Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level
subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability
that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics,
abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet
they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and
limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly
from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more
applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on
rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose
a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining
structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach
leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems,
integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified
framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision
alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our
method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently
identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and
outperform existing approaches.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了软体机器人手和触觉传感的进步，利用机器学习实现复杂任务，特别是通过GelSight Baby Fin Ray技术抓取和分类坚果纹理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索GelSight Baby Fin Ray的潜力，通过学习区分坚果壳纹理并进行力和位置估计，提升软体机器人的环境理解与交互能力。

Method: 采用了多种神经网络结构（如ResNet50、GoogLeNet、3层和5层CNN）进行消融研究，以从高分辨率触觉图像中提取有用信息。

Result: 实验表明，机器学习能有效帮助软体机器人从触觉图像中提取信息，增强其对环境的理解和交互能力。

Conclusion: 机器学习是从高分辨率触觉图像中提取信息的有前途的技术，有助于软体机器人更好地理解和与环境互动。

Abstract: Recent advances in soft robotic hands and tactile sensing have enabled both
to perform an increasing number of complex tasks with the aid of machine
learning. In particular, we presented the GelSight Baby Fin Ray in our previous
work, which integrates a camera with a soft, compliant Fin Ray structure.
Camera-based tactile sensing gives the GelSight Baby Fin Ray the ability to
capture rich contact information like forces, object geometries, and textures.
Moreover, our previous work showed that the GelSight Baby Fin Ray can dig
through clutter, and classify in-shell nuts. To further examine the potential
of the GelSight Baby Fin Ray, we leverage learning to distinguish nut-in-shell
textures and to perform force and position estimation. We implement ablation
studies with popular neural network structures, including ResNet50, GoogLeNet,
and 3- and 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. We conclude
that machine learning is a promising technique to extract useful information
from high-resolution tactile images and empower soft robotics to better
understand and interact with the environments.

*Adam D. Hines,Alejandro Fontan,Michael Milford,Tobias Fischer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Event-LAB是一个统一框架，用于简化事件基定位方法在多数据集上的运行和比较，解决了依赖和数据格式多样化的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件基定位研究快速增长，但依赖和数据格式的多样化使得方法比较和实现变得复杂。

Method: 使用Pixi包管理器实现Event-LAB框架，支持单一命令行安装和调用，涵盖VPR和SLAM两种常见管线。

Result: 框架能系统可视化分析多方法和数据集结果，揭示事件收集参数对性能的影响，强调了公平比较的重要性。

Conclusion: Event-LAB为研究社区提供了统一的工具，简化了多条件下的方法比较和工作流程。

Abstract: Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of
interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published
papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the
field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the
variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats,
making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement
reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified
framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across
multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and
dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and
invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common
event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the
framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple
methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of
parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame
generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis
demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent
event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this
ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for
easily setting up multiple conditions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于人类示教的草莓采摘机器人系统，通过改进的视觉运动策略解决了草莓因自然生长特性导致的遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草莓因自然生长在丛中易被遮挡，传统机器人采摘系统难以处理，需要一种能精确绕过障碍并定位最佳采摘点的解决方案。

Method: 采用4自由度SCARA机械臂和人类遥操作接口收集数据，并利用改进的End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT)开发精细视觉运动策略。

Result: 实验表明，改进方法在多种遮挡场景下显著优于直接应用ACT，展现了实际应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为遮挡草莓采摘提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and
other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit
presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional
percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter.
Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to
carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely
access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To
address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that
learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired
with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and
leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a
fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion
scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the
direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical
application in occluded strawberry picking.

Motivation: 解决振动筛操作中的三大挑战：狭窄空间操作、双臂协同传递以及受约束的粉末容器交付。

Result: 实验结果显示规划时间减少80.4%，路径点减少89.4%，并在物理实验中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂实验室自动化中表现出高效性和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker
operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1)
dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in
overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with
orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including
inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to
prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework
combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization.
The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency
in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying,
imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to
80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes
the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment,
validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.

Abstract: Curated datasets are essential for training and evaluating AI approaches, but
are often lacking in domains where language and physical action are deeply
intertwined. In particular, few datasets capture how people acquire embodied
skills through verbal instruction over time. To address this gap, we introduce
SimCoachCorpus: a unique dataset of race car simulator driving that allows for
the investigation of rich interactive phenomena during guided and unguided
motor skill acquisition. In this dataset, 29 humans were asked to drive in a
simulator around a race track for approximately ninety minutes. Fifteen
participants were given personalized one-on-one instruction from a professional
performance driving coach, and 14 participants drove without coaching. \name\
includes embodied features such as vehicle state and inputs, map (track
boundaries and raceline), and cone landmarks. These are synchronized with
concurrent verbal coaching from a professional coach and additional feedback at
the end of each lap. We further provide annotations of coaching categories for
each concurrent feedback utterance, ratings on students' compliance with
coaching advice, and self-reported cognitive load and emotional state of
participants (gathered from surveys during the study). The dataset includes
over 20,000 concurrent feedback utterances, over 400 terminal feedback
utterances, and over 40 hours of vehicle driving data. Our naturalistic dataset
can be used for investigating motor learning dynamics, exploring linguistic
phenomena, and training computational models of teaching. We demonstrate
applications of this dataset for in-context learning, imitation learning, and
topic modeling. The dataset introduced in this work will be released publicly
upon publication of the peer-reviewed version of this paper. Researchers

Conclusion: 通过引入针对受限结构的染色体初始化方法，系统显著降低了局部最优风险，且能在合理时间内生成满足多条件的计划。

Abstract: This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules,
sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically
disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems
must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but
the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address
this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools,
together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system
is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting
multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic
timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for
sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint
programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search
space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained
structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable
robotic disassembly.

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了预训练效果，并在新机器人配置上实现了高效微调。

Conclusion: 该方法通过等变性设计解决了配置泛化问题，为跨机器人预训练提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks,
environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their
ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most
approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less
attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration
generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this
challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies
equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this
principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment
equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an
action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates
a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial
reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables
efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments. Our code is available at

TL;DR: BEV-ODOM2是一个改进的单目视觉里程计框架，通过引入密集BEV光流监督和PV-BEV融合，解决了现有BEV方法在稀疏监督和投影信息丢失方面的问题，实现了40%的相对轨迹误差提升。

Motivation: 现有BEV表示方法在单目视觉里程计中存在稀疏监督信号和投影信息丢失的问题，需要改进以提升性能。

Method: 提出密集BEV光流监督和PV-BEV融合技术，保留6-DoF运动信息并通过三级监督训练模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，相对轨迹误差提升40%，并发布了新的多场景数据集ZJH-VO。

Conclusion: BEV-ODOM2显著提高了BEV方法的性能，为未来研究提供了新的数据集和技术支持。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation offers a metric-scaled planar workspace,
facilitating the simplification of 6-DoF ego-motion to a more robust 3-DoF
model for monocular visual odometry (MVO) in intelligent transportation
systems. However, existing BEV methods suffer from sparse supervision signals
and information loss during perspective-to-BEV projection. We present
BEV-ODOM2, an enhanced framework addressing both limitations without additional
annotations. Our approach introduces: (1) dense BEV optical flow supervision
constructed from 3-DoF pose ground truth for pixel-level guidance; (2) PV-BEV
fusion that computes correlation volumes before projection to preserve 6-DoF
motion cues while maintaining scale consistency. The framework employs three
supervision levels derived solely from pose data: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF for the
PV branch, and final 3-DoF output. Enhanced rotation sampling further balances
diverse motion patterns in training. Extensive evaluation on KITTI, NCLT,
Oxford, and our newly collected ZJH-VO multi-scale dataset demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 40 improvement in RTE compared to
previous BEV methods. The ZJH-VO dataset, covering diverse ground vehicle
scenarios from underground parking to outdoor plazas, is publicly available to
facilitate future research.

Motivation: 现有三平面方法计算量大且不适合嵌入式3D推理，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出无插值三平面提升和体积融合框架，将非线性移至2D卷积，并添加低分辨率体积分支以捕获全局上下文。

Result: 分类和完成任务保持或提高准确性，而分割和检测任务以轻微精度下降换取显著计算节省。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适合嵌入式机器人感知，实现了实时吞吐量。

Abstract: Dense 3D convolutions provide high accuracy for perception but are too
computationally expensive for real-time robotic systems. Existing tri-plane
methods rely on 2D image features with interpolation, point-wise queries, and
implicit MLPs, which makes them computationally heavy and unsuitable for
embedded 3D inference. As an alternative, we propose a novel interpolation-free
tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion framework, that directly projects 3D
voxels into plane features and reconstructs a feature volume through broadcast
and summation. This shifts nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, reducing complexity
while remaining fully parallelizable. To capture global context, we add a
low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a
lightweight integration layer, yielding a design that is both efficient and
end-to-end GPU-accelerated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we conduct experiments on classification, completion, segmentation, and
detection, and we map the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy across
tasks. Results show that classification and completion retain or improve
accuracy, while segmentation and detection trade modest drops in accuracy for
significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on an NVIDIA Jetson
Orin nano confirm robust real-time throughput, demonstrating the suitability of
the approach for embedded robotic perception.

Abstract: The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces
several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition,
the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between

RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror
builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference
system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To
facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated
VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive
trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative
models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and
robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where
models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot
seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of
these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that
significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

outperforms traditional tactile imitation learning. Our work bridges the gap

Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK
2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by
Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez
et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom
(DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the
differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a
smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space
singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which
makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a
singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation
of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

Motivation: 传统基于模型的控制器依赖预计算的参考轨迹，限制了性能。本文受RL启发，研究如何直接优化竞速目标而非替代目标。

Result: 提出的无参考方法在竞速性能上与或优于基于参考的方法。

Conclusion: 无参考的MPPI方法可直接优化竞速目标，性能出色，为控制器设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in
autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance
on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as
trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,
whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but
still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning
(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate
objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of
directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this
work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by
incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,
directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The
sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the
discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish
a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare
three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and
parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the
proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three
objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves
competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.

### [45] [Investigating the Effect of LED Signals and Emotional Displays in Human-Robot Shared Workspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14748)
*Maria Ibrahim,Alap Kshirsagar,Dorothea Koert,Jan Peters*

TL;DR: 研究探讨了非语言交流在人类-机器人协作中的作用，发现情绪展示虽能提高交互感知，但对任务性能影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善人类-机器人协作中的沟通，以提升安全性和效率。

Method: 为机器人装备LED灯条和面部表情显示器，测试不同信号组合的效果。

Result: 情绪展示未显著提升碰撞预测、沟通清晰度或任务效率。

Conclusion: 情绪提示可增强用户参与感，但对任务性能的提升作用有限。

Abstract: Effective communication is essential for safety and efficiency in human-robot
collaboration, particularly in shared workspaces. This paper investigates the
impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by
integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic
system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end
effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent
through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot
collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED
signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals
with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires
and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived
clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while
emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did
not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or
task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that
while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task
performance in shared workspaces is limited.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PVRs在视觉控制系统中作为安全过滤器的应用潜力，以解决其在实际部署中的安全性挑战。

Method: 使用PVRs作为分类器、HJ可达性安全过滤器以及潜在世界模型的骨干，比较不同训练策略（从头训练、微调、冻结）的效果，并评估其在资源受限设备上的适用性。

Result: 分析了PVRs在不同任务中的表现，探讨了世界模型与Q函数在安全策略切换中的优劣，并提供了实际部署的建议。

Conclusion: PVRs在视觉安全过滤器中具有潜力，但需根据具体任务选择合适的训练方法和模型结构，同时考虑资源限制。

Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge
hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained
increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical
control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have
so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be
effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this
paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for
designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers
defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety
filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between
training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the
models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is
superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions
are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical
considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个多阶段探索与操作框架，专注于受限和杂乱环境中的智能操作；通过多目标效用函数和约束优化策略，显著提高了操作成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受限和杂乱环境中的操作因部分可观测性和复杂配置空间而具有挑战性，需要智能探索策略以安全地理解场景和搜索目标。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包括近场感知扫描构建局部碰撞图、多目标效用函数选择视点、约束操作优化策略生成操作姿态。

Result: 仿真中操作成功率提升24.25%，真实实验验证了框架在受限环境中主动感知和操作的能力。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过多阶段策略显著提升了受限复杂环境中的操作成功率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces.
Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration
strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper,
we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework
featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce
collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision
map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find
viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation.
Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to
generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To
systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we
propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing
four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for
other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases
manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments
demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in
confined environments.

*Humphrey Munn,Brendan Tidd,Peter Böhm,Marcus Gallagher,David Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在强化学习（RL）中多任务目标冲突的问题，提出了一种改进的优化方法GCR-PPO，通过多目标分解和优先级解决冲突，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的强化学习方法通过单一标量奖励聚合多个任务目标，导致奖励调优困难、易陷入局部最优，限制了方法的扩展性。多目标方法因计算成本和优化难度在机器人领域应用较少。

Method: 提出了GCR-PPO方法，通过多头部评论家分解目标梯度，并根据目标优先级解决冲突，优化了actor-critic的更新过程。

Result: 在IsaacLab操纵和运动基准测试中，GCR-PPO比并行PPO表现出更高的扩展性和性能（平均提升9.5%），特别是在冲突任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: GCR-PPO通过多目标分解和冲突解决机制，显著提升了强化学习在多任务场景中的效果，为机器人控制提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task
objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy
optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot
locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning
and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the
number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their
trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain
underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation
difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient
contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task
objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between
task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic
behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that
decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed
critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology,
GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion
benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks.
We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without
significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more
conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average
improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CollabVLA是一个自我反思的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过结合VLM的反思推理与扩散动作生成，解决了现有VLA方法的域过拟合、非解释性推理和高延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在将传统的视觉运动策略转变为协作助手，克服现有VLAs的局限性，如缺乏解释性、高延迟和域过拟合。

Method: 采用混合专家设计，结合VLM的反思推理和扩散动作生成，通过两阶段训练（动作基础和反思调整）实现自我反思和主动寻求人类指导。

Result: 相比生成型代理，标准化时间减少约2倍，尝试次数减少约4倍，同时提高了成功率、解释性和低延迟平衡。

Conclusion: CollabVLA推动了VLAs从不透明的控制器向能够推理、执行并与人类协作的真正助手迈进。

Abstract: In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action
framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative
assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain
overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary
generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with
diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a
two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it
supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when
confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x
and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates,
improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing
methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque
controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and
collaborating with humans.

### [50] [PERAL: Perception-Aware Motion Control for Passive LiDAR Excitation in Spherical Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14915)
*Shenghai Yuan,Jason Wai Hao Yee,Weixiang Guo,Zhongyuan Liu,Thien-Minh Nguyen,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PERAL是一种感知感知的运动控制框架，通过被动LiDAR激励提升垂直扫描多样性，无需专用硬件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水平安装LiDAR在特征稀缺环境中因地面返回少导致的性能下降问题，避免传统方案的硬件成本和不便。

Method: 通过建模内部差速驱动与传感器姿态的耦合，在目标跟踪命令上叠加有界非周期性振荡，丰富垂直扫描多样性。

Result: 实验显示96%的地图完整性、27%的轨迹跟踪误差降低，且在人检测和成本方面优于基线。

Conclusion: PERAL在低成本和小型化下实现了高性能的LiDAR-IMU导航和感知。

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for
navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360
capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading
performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt,
active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal
perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a
perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves
passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling
between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL
superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or
trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while
preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL
is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments.
Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent
reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection,
all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active
rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be
open-sourced upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人软件框架在支持大规模通用策略学习和模拟到现实的转换方面存在局限性，研究人员需要一个更高效、灵活的解决方案来推动机器人学习的发展。

Method: 设计了模块化、易扩展的分层架构RCS，提供了统一的模拟和物理机器人接口，简化了从模拟到现实的过渡。

Conclusion: RCS为机器人学习研究提供了一个高效、灵活的解决方案，推动了大规模通用策略的发展，并为模拟到现实的迁移提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning.
They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert
policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In
this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and
scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a
bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for
transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this
gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from
the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist
policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered
architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots,
facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and
dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world
experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is
twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design
principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the
development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an
extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed
light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance. Our

Result: 输出一组飞行就绪的人形机器人配置和验证过的控制参数，实现了轨迹跟踪误差和机械能耗的最小化。

Conclusion: 该框架为选择和实施可行的空中人形机器人设计提供了结构化方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a CAD-driven co-design framework for optimizing
jet-powered aerial humanoid robots to execute dynamically constrained
trajectories. Starting from the iRonCub-Mk3 model, a Design of Experiments
(DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically
feasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g.,
angle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed
through CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with
simulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity
analysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids
selected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight
performance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based
linearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective
optimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring
the space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to
minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The
framework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated
control parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing
feasible aerial humanoid designs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of
articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain
significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel
framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and
linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency
and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART
leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify
optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these
interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an
optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the
limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline
reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation
ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness. For

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Multi-CAP的分层覆盖路径规划算法，通过新型连通性感知方法协调多机器人，显著提升了大范围未知环境的覆盖效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人在未知大范围环境中协调覆盖的挑战，目标是减少总路径长度和机器人冲突。

Method: 采用分层规划，构建和维护动态邻接图表示环境，将其建模为车辆路径问题(Ve RP)，为每个机器人分配独立子区域并优化路径。

Result: 仿真和实验验证Multi-CAP在覆盖时间、总路径长度和路径重叠率等指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 连通性感知图和全局路径规划对性能提升至关重要，Multi-CAP在多机器人覆盖任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown
environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total
coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we
introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical
coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination
through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and
dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a
set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the
environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement
of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical
layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots
explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal
routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that
minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set
of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting
its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on
real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through
simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time,
total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate
the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner
in achieving these performance gains.

TL;DR: HICS-SLAM是一个结合人类实时交互的语义SLAM框架，通过共享扩展现实环境提升机器人在复杂场景中的地图精度和语义完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义SLAM系统在遮挡、数据不完整或几何模糊的真实场景中表现不佳，无法充分利用人类的高层次空间和语义知识。

Method: 提出HICS-SLAM，采用基于图的语义融合方法，允许人类通过扩展现实环境实时干预和增强机器人的3D场景图。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在房间检测精度、地图精度和语义完整性上优于自动基线系统。

Conclusion: HICS-SLAM展示了人机合作在语义SLAM中的有效性，并具有扩展潜力。

Abstract: Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems enrich robot
maps with structural and semantic information, enabling robots to operate more
effectively in complex environments. However, these systems struggle in
real-world scenarios with occlusions, incomplete data, or ambiguous geometries,
as they cannot fully leverage the higher-level spatial and semantic knowledge
humans naturally apply. We introduce HICS-SLAM, a Human-in-the-Loop semantic
SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality environment for real-time
collaboration. The system allows human operators to directly interact with and
visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a
graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human
interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for
enhanced situational awareness. Experimental evaluations on real-world
construction site datasets demonstrate improvements in room detection accuracy,
map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines,
demonstrating both the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for
future extensions.

Conclusion: 滑动+旋转是最优的神经形态触觉探索策略，对机器人环境交互具有重要潜力。

Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture
classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system
utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a
series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture
classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as
the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding.
We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final
accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In
the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these
two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds.
Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\%
with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of
only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the
optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in
texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing
robotic environmental interaction.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration in surgery is affected by the inherent
ambiguity of verbal communication. This paper presents a framework for a
robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal
instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the
operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning
process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal
vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge
base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal
prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence
measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous
commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical
requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation
rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the
operating room.

Motivation: 解决四旋翼在未知环境中导航的三个关键挑战：非凸自由空间、动态特性和探索需求。

Method: 提出PA-MPPI，通过感知成本调整轨迹以探索未知区域。

Result: PA-MPPI在硬件实验中性能提升达100%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PA-MPPI是一种安全可靠的导航策略，适用于无法直接到达目标的场景。

Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical
missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving it requires addressing three key
challenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,
quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of
unknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path
Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the
first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can
effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the
full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs
such as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is
limited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by
large obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI
(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory
online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,
PA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown
regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood
of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we
demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and
mapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging
settings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate
that PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation
foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly
reachable.

Result: 实验中，M4Diffuser成功率提高7%-56%，碰撞减少3%-31%。

Conclusion: M4Diffuser在非结构化环境中表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a
robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation
in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are

Motivation: 在人形机器人系统中，触觉传感网络的配置是一个复杂问题，指尖以外的触觉信息常被忽视。本研究旨在探索不同手部区域的触觉反馈对控制策略的影响。

Method: 通过在手指和手掌的不同区域放置触觉传感器，分析其对深度强化学习控制策略的影响，并研究物体特性与传感器最佳布局的关系。

Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems,
must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a
wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of
sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for
placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of
the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile
feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand
object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different
parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning
control policies and investigate the relationship between object
characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing
configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of
manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of
anthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and
societal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems
must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware
configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered,
task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new
scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have
shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as
manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction
machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified
open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining,
and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first
trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then
fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through
both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT
policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy,
successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance
comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation,
we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new
tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while
maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results
highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and
generalizable autonomous excavation.

Conclusion: 该框架在大规模动态环境中表现出高可靠性和实用价值。

Abstract: Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet
remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments.
In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel
Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide
high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic
environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map
representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes
global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift.
Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using
a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal
drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and
dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for
flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing
localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments
conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575
hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The
results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art
LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments,
highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.

Abstract: We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that
incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient
intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot
coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set
of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task
performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network
flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online
algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task
failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline
approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random
missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a
greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced
simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and
executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy
in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task
plans while leveraging task relationships.

Result: 在8项真实任务中表现优于现有VLA方法。

Conclusion: Ask-to-Clarify框架为构建协作式智能体提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can
interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions.
This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based
on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this
goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way
mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This
approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.
In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our
framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a
multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.
Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM
for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection
module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the
VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable
conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation
strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using
ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the
action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the
interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The
training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then
generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router
that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We
evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it
outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our
proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward
collaborative embodied agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来行星探测车需要在混合电源（RTG和太阳能）下长时间运行，但现有规划方法往往忽略能量可行性，导致轨迹规划不满足瞬时功率限制。

Method: 框架结合了平移、旋转和阻力功率的物理模型，并将累积能量预算和瞬时功率约束集成到SE(2)多项式轨迹优化中。

Result: 在类似月球地形的模拟中，该规划器的峰值功率控制在规定限制的0.55%以内，而现有方法超出限制超过17%。

Conclusion: 该方法为长时行星任务提供了一种原则性强且实用的能量感知自主规划解决方案。

Abstract: Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on
hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator
(RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While
energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under
battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or
enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners
emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods
typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting
energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning
framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,
rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid
RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and
instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory
optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,
dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like
terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within
0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by
over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to
energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.

Motivation: 解决强工具使用任务中流式传感器数据的噪声、非平稳性和任务工具差异性问题。

Result: 在四个强工具使用任务中，F1分数和AUROC优于其他方法，对噪声数据更鲁棒。

Conclusion: AnoF-Diff方法在强工具使用任务中表现出色，适用于在线异常检测。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying
unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for
several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful
tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world
tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies
across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a
method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque
features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect
anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms
of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)
on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better
performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method
of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and
demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several
forceful tool use experiments.

Conclusion: 优化设计在实际环境中表现出色，展示了框架的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated
remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and
dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the
environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has
focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with
pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots
is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this
end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,
bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to
include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these
models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model
and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our
framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for
vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that
minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.
We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing
uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully
deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.

Motivation: 说话人分割系统在高内在说话人变异性（如情绪、健康或内容的变化）下表现不佳，容易将同一说话人的不同片段误分类为不同个体。

Method: 基于传统分割系统输出的片段，提出了一种风格可控的语音生成模型，生成具有更多语音和风格多样性的增强样本，并将原始和生成音频的说话人嵌入混合以提高系统鲁棒性。

Result: 在模拟情感语音数据集和截断的AMI数据集上验证了方法的有效性，错误率分别降低了49%和35%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过风格可控的语音生成和嵌入混合显著提升了说话人分割系统在高内在变异性场景下的性能。

Abstract: Speaker diarization systems often struggle with high intrinsic intra-speaker
variability, such as shifts in emotion, health, or content. This can cause
segments from the same speaker to be misclassified as different individuals,
for example, when one raises their voice or speaks faster during conversation.
To address this, we propose a style-controllable speech generation model that
augments speech across diverse styles while preserving the target speaker's
identity. The proposed system starts with diarized segments from a conventional
diarizer. For each diarized segment, it generates augmented speech samples
enriched with phonetic and stylistic diversity. And then, speaker embeddings
from both the original and generated audio are blended to enhance the system's
robustness in grouping segments with high intrinsic intra-speaker variability.
We validate our approach on a simulated emotional speech dataset and the
truncated AMI dataset, demonstrating significant improvements, with error rate
reductions of 49% and 35% on each dataset, respectively.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提高了多标签语音分类的性能，还探讨了人类感知与模型表现之间的关系。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-label classification framework to detect
multiple speaking styles in a speech sample. Unlike previous studies that have
primarily focused on identifying a single target style, our framework
effectively captures various speaker characteristics within a unified
structure, making it suitable for generalized human-computer interaction
applications. The proposed framework integrates cross-attention mechanisms
within a transformer decoder to extract salient features associated with each
target label from the input speech. To mitigate the data imbalance inherent in
multi-label speech datasets, we employ a data augmentation technique based on a
speech generation model. We validate our model's effectiveness through multiple
objective evaluations on seen and unseen corpora. In addition, we provide an
analysis of the influence of human perception on classification accuracy by
considering the impact of human labeling agreement on model performance.

Abstract: Replay speech attacks pose a significant threat to voice-controlled systems,
especially in smart environments where voice assistants are widely deployed.
While multi-channel audio offers spatial cues that can enhance replay detection
robustness, existing datasets and methods predominantly rely on single-channel
recordings. In this work, we introduce an acoustic simulation framework
designed to simulate multi-channel replay speech configurations using publicly
available resources. Our setup models both genuine and spoofed speech across
varied environments, including realistic microphone and loudspeaker impulse
responses, room acoustics, and noise conditions. The framework employs measured
loudspeaker directionalities during the replay attack to improve the realism of
the simulation. We define two spoofing settings, which simulate whether a
reverberant or an anechoic speech is used in the replay scenario, and evaluate
the impact of omnidirectional and diffuse noise on detection performance. Using
the state-of-the-art M-ALRAD model for replay speech detection, we demonstrate
that synthetic data can support the generalization capabilities of the detector
across unseen enclosures.

Method: 采用了反记忆引导（AMG）技术，修改了预训练扩散模型的采样过程，以避免记忆。在Stable Audio Open架构上实现了三种类型的引导策略。

Result: 实验表明，AMG显著减少了基于扩散的文本到音频生成中的记忆效应，同时保持了音频保真度和语义对齐。

Conclusion: AMG是一种有效的技术，可以在不牺牲生成质量的情况下缓解文本到音频扩散模型中的数据复制问题。

Abstract: A persistent challenge in generative audio models is data replication, where
the model unintentionally generates parts of its training data during
inference. In this work, we address this issue in text-to-audio diffusion
models by exploring the use of anti-memorization strategies. We adopt
Anti-Memorization Guidance (AMG), a technique that modifies the sampling
process of pre-trained diffusion models to discourage memorization. Our study
explores three types of guidance within AMG, each designed to reduce
replication while preserving generation quality. We use Stable Audio Open as
our backbone, leveraging its fully open-source architecture and training
dataset. Our comprehensive experimental analysis suggests that AMG
significantly mitigates memorization in diffusion-based text-to-audio
generation without compromising audio fidelity or semantic alignment.

Abstract: The task of Mel vocoding, i.e., the inversion of a Mel magnitude spectrogram
to an audio waveform, is still a key component in many text-to-speech (TTS)
systems today. Based on generative flow matching, our prior work on generative
STFT phase retrieval (DiffPhase), and the pseudoinverse operator of the Mel

only in theory, but in practice on a consumer laptop GPU. Furthermore, we show
that our model achieves substantially better PESQ and SI-SDR values compared to
well-established not streaming-capable baselines for Mel vocoding including

Conclusion: 所提出的自适应步长规则在去中心化优化中表现良好，无需额外调参。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive step-size rule for decentralized optimization.
Choosing a step-size that balances convergence and stability is challenging.
This is amplified in the decentralized setting as agents observe only local
(possibly stochastic) gradients and global information (like smoothness) is
unavailable. We derive a step-size rule from first principles. The resulting
formulation reduces to the well-known Polyak's rule in the single-agent
setting, and is suitable for use with stochastic gradients. The method is
parameter free, apart from requiring the optimal objective value, which is
readily available in many applications. Numerical simulations demonstrate that
the performance is comparable to the optimally fine-tuned step-size.

Result: 在公共数据集上，效率提升3.78倍，精度是高斯混合模型的2倍，实时运行达36.4 fps。

Conclusion: 该方法在点云参数化任务中显著提高了效率和精度，适用于实时场景。

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

Motivation: 随着电商产品类别的快速增长，传统仅依赖2D外观特征的方法在处理类内变异性、视觉相似物品及复杂场景时性能下降显著。

Method: RoboEye分两阶段：首阶段训练大型视觉模型提取2D特征生成候选排名；次阶段通过轻量级3D模块判断是否需3D重排，并使用3D特征提取器和关键点匹配器优化结果。

Result: 实验表明，RoboEye将Recall@1提高了7.1%，且仅需RGB图像，降低了部署成本。

Conclusion: RoboEye通过动态结合2D和3D特征，显著提升了复杂场景下的物体识别性能，同时避免了不必要的计算开销。

Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code

### [76] [RynnVLA-001: Using Human Demonstrations to Improve Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15212)
*Yuming Jiang,Siteng Huang,Shengke Xue,Yaxi Zhao,Jun Cen,Sicong Leng,Kehan Li,Jiayan Guo,Kexiang Wang,Mingxiu Chen,Fan Wang,Deli Zhao,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RynnVLA-001是一种基于大规模视频生成预训练的视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型，通过两阶段预训练方法在机器人任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决视觉-语言-动作模型在复杂任务中的表现问题，论文提出一种新的两阶段预训练方法，结合视频生成和动作预测。

Method: 1. 第一阶段是自我中心视频生成预训练，通过1200万自我中心操作视频训练图像到视频模型；2. 第二阶段是人物中心轨迹感知建模，联合预测未来关键点轨迹；3. 提出ActionVAE压缩动作序列以减少输出空间复杂性。

Result: 在下游机器人任务中微调后，RynnVLA-001超越了现有最佳基线模型。

Conclusion: 论文提出的预训练策略为VLA模型提供了更有效的初始化方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built
upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We
propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric
Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric
manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame
and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware
Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories,
thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction.
Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a
variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact
latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When
finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the
proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA
models.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖于完整且无噪声的观测数据，但在现实场景中，视野外对象和传感器噪声带来挑战，限制了预测的可靠性。

Method: 使用摄像头校准建立视觉定位映射，开发了一个视觉定位去噪模块，以无监督方式去噪传感器数据。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous
systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and
virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free
observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight
objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera
coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised
trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable
prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present
advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the
noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.
Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight
Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending
its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual
reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera
calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of
visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an
unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB
datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory
denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.
Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such
as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,
providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative
to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor
trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances. The
code and preprocessed datasets are available at github.com/Hai-chao-Zhang/OST

*Wenyan Ma,Lipeng Zhu,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型可移动天线(MA)无线传感系统，相比固定天线(FPA)显著提升传感性能。通过优化MA运动轨迹，降低了角度估计的Cramer-Rao界(CRB)和实际误差(MSE)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定天线(FPA)在角度估计上存在性能局限，MA通过动态运动可提升精度。

Method: 分析了MA轨迹对角度估计的影响，推导了1D和2D运动下的CRB，并提出优化算法设计最优轨迹。

Result: 与FPA相比，MA显著降低CRB和实际MSE，且运动轨迹的导向向量在角域相关性低，提高了角度分辨率。

Conclusion: MA系统通过动态运动优化轨迹，显著提升了AoA估计性能，展现出实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new wireless sensing system utilizing a movable
antenna (MA) that continuously moves and receives sensing signals to enhance
sensing performance over the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) sensing.
We show that the angle estimation performance is fundamentally determined by
the MA trajectory, and derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square
error (MSE) for angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the
trajectory for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) antenna
movement. For the 1D case, a globally optimal trajectory that minimizes the CRB
is derived in closed form. Notably, the resulting CRB decreases cubically with
sensing time in the time-constrained regime, whereas it decreases linearly with
sensing time and quadratically with the movement line segment's length in the
space-constrained regime. For the 2D case, we aim to achieve the minimum of
maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the
horizontal and vertical axes. To this end, we design an efficient alternating
optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the MA's horizontal or vertical
coordinates with the other being fixed, yielding a locally optimal trajectory.
Numerical results show that the proposed 1D/2D MA-based sensing schemes
significantly reduce both the CRB and actual AoA estimation MSE compared to
conventional FPA-based sensing with uniform linear/planar arrays (ULAs/UPAs) as
well as various benchmark MA trajectories. Moreover, it is revealed that the
steering vectors of our designed 1D/2D MA trajectories have low correlation in
the angular domain, thereby effectively increasing the angular resolution for
achieving higher AoA estimation accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨节点移动性对信息网络中信息新鲜度的影响。

Method: 使用随机混合系统框架分析不同拓扑和移动性缩放下的信息传播，并通过模拟验证理论结果。

Result: 接触移动性能显著提升网络信息新鲜度，尤其是在断连和全连接网络中。

Conclusion: 优化移动成本后，接触移动性可进一步改善网络的平均版本年龄。

Abstract: A gossip network is considered in which a source node updates its status
while other nodes in the network aim at keeping track of it as it varies over
time. Information gets disseminated by the source sending status updates to the
nodes, and the nodes gossiping with each other. In addition, the nodes in the
network are mobile, and can move to other nodes to get information, which we
term contact mobility. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as
possible, i.e., to have the same information as the source's. To evaluate the
freshness of information, we use the Version Age-of-Information (VAoI) metric,
defined as the difference between the version of information available at a
given node and that at the source. We analyze the effect of contact mobility on
information dissemination in the gossip network using a Stochastic Hybrid
System (SHS) framework for different topologies and mobility scalings with
increasing number of nodes. It is shown that with the presence of contact
mobility the freshness of the network improves in both ends of the network
connectivity spectrum: disconnected and fully connected gossip networks. We
mathematically analyze the average version age scalings and validate our
theoretical results via simulations. Finally, we incorporate the cost of
mobility for the network by formulating and solving an optimization problem
that minimizes a weighted sum of version age and mobility cost. Our results
show that contact mobility, with optimized mobility cost, improves the average
version age in the network.

Motivation: 解决因拦截器导引头配备不均导致的目标观测能力差异问题。

Method: 使用固定时间分布式观测器，结合偏离追踪制导和高阶滑模一致性协议。

Result: 仿真验证了制导和估计架构的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效实现时间一致性，适用于异质拦截器协同拦截任务。

Abstract: This paper presents a cooperative guidance strategy for the simultaneous
interception of a constant-velocity, non-maneuvering target, addressing the
realistic scenario where only a subset of interceptors are equipped with
onboard seekers. To overcome the resulting heterogeneity in target
observability, a fixed-time distributed observer is employed, enabling
seeker-less interceptors to estimate the target state using information from
seeker-equipped agents and local neighbors over a directed communication
topology. Departing from conventional strategies that approximate time-to-go
via linearization or small-angle assumptions, the proposed approach leverages
deviated pursuit guidance where the time-to-go expression is exact for such a
target. Moreover, a higher-order sliding mode consensus protocol is utilized to
establish time-to-go consensus within a finite time. The effectiveness of the
proposed guidance and estimation architecture is demonstrated through
simulations.

TL;DR: Chameleon框架在5G毫米波网络中实现通信与感知集成，通过快速切换波束形成器，同时支持多用户通信和高效感知成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前5G网络中波束形成通常仅用于通信或感知，无法同时满足两种需求。

Method: 提出Chameleon框架，在每个DMRS符号期间动态切换波束形成器，同时生成通信波束和感知波束。

Result: 实验显示，Chameleon支持两用户总数据率达0.80 Gbps，并在0.875 ms内完成2D成像，定位和分类精度高。

Conclusion: Chameleon成功集成通信与感知，为未来网络提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Next-generation cellular networks are envisioned to integrate sensing
capabilities with communication, particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave)
spectrum, where beamforming using large-scale antenna arrays enables
directional signal transmissions for improved spatial multiplexing. In current
5G networks, however, beamforming is typically designed either for
communication or sensing (e.g., beam training during link establishment). In
this paper, we present Chameleon, a novel framework that augments and rapidly
switches beamformers during each demodulation reference signal (DMRS) symbol to
achieve integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 5G mmWave networks. Each
beamformer introduces an additional sensing beam toward target angles while
maintaining the communication beams toward multiple users. We implement
Chameleon on a 28 GHz software-defined radio testbed supporting over-the-air 5G
physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) transmissions. Extensive experiments
in open environments show that Chameleon achieves multi-user communication with
a sum data rate of up to 0.80 Gbps across two users. Simultaneously, Chameleon
employs a beamformer switching interval of only 0.24 {\mu}s, therefore
producing a 31x31-point 2D imaging within just 0.875 ms. Leveraging machine
learning, Chameleon further enables object localization with median errors of
0.14 m (distance) and 0.24{\deg} (angle), and material classification with
99.0% accuracy.

Motivation: 探讨乐器伴奏如何影响SingFake检测模型的行为和表征方式，以期设计更可解释和稳健的系统。

Method: 从行为效应（测试不同模型、乐器音轨和频带）和表征效应（微调如何改变编码器的语音和音乐能力）两个角度进行分析。

Result: 乐器伴奏主要充当数据增强而非内在线索；微调增加了对说话人特征的依赖，降低了对内容、副语言和语义信息的敏感性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型如何利用声乐与乐器线索，为设计更可解释和稳健的SingFake检测系统提供了指导。

Abstract: Although many models exist to detect singing voice deepfakes (SingFake), how
these models operate, particularly with instrumental accompaniment, is unclear.
We investigate how instrumental music affects SingFake detection from two
perspectives. To investigate the behavioral effect, we test different
backbones, unpaired instrumental tracks, and frequency subbands. To analyze the
representational effect, we probe how fine-tuning alters encoders' speech and
music capabilities. Our results show that instrumental accompaniment acts
mainly as data augmentation rather than providing intrinsic cues (e.g., rhythm
or harmony). Furthermore, fine-tuning increases reliance on shallow speaker
features while reducing sensitivity to content, paralinguistic, and semantic
information. These insights clarify how models exploit vocal versus
instrumental cues and can inform the design of more interpretable and robust
SingFake detection systems.

Motivation: 射频指纹识别（RFFI）通过设备模拟电路的小差异进行识别，避免了复杂的加密认证，但现有模型易受复制、篡改和规避攻击的影响。

Method: 使用ResNet-34处理对数梅尔频谱图，嵌入三种水印（简单触发、抗噪声和滤波的对抗触发、隐藏梯度/权重签名），并结合卷积变分自编码器（VAE）进行异常检测。

Result: 在LoRa数据集上，系统实现了94.6%的准确率、98%的水印成功率和0.94的AUROC值。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了可验证、防篡改的认证，显著提升了射频指纹识别的安全性。

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) distinguishes wireless
devices by the small variations in their analog circuits, avoiding heavy
cryptographic authentication. While deep learning on spectrograms improves
accuracy, models remain vulnerable to copying, tampering, and evasion. We
present a stronger RFFI system combining watermarking for ownership proof and
anomaly detection for spotting suspicious inputs. Using a ResNet-34 on log-Mel
spectrograms, we embed three watermarks: a simple trigger, an adversarially
trained trigger robust to noise and filtering, and a hidden gradient/weight
signature. A convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler
(KL) warm-up and free-bits flags off-distribution queries. On the LoRa dataset,
our system achieves 94.6% accuracy, 98% watermark success, and 0.94 AUROC,
offering verifiable, tamper-resistant authentication.

Conclusion: MF-HRL-IGM在多保真度环境下有效平衡成本和性能，为强化学习提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy typically requires extensive
interactions with a high-fidelity simulator of the environment, which are often
costly or impractical. Offline RL addresses this problem by allowing training
from pre-collected data, but its effectiveness is strongly constrained by the
size and quality of the dataset. Hybrid offline-online RL leverages both
offline data and interactions with a single simulator of the environment. In
many real-world scenarios, however, multiple simulators with varying levels of
fidelity and computational cost are available. In this work, we study
multi-fidelity hybrid RL for policy optimization under a fixed cost budget. We
introduce multi-fidelity hybrid RL via information gain maximization
(MF-HRL-IGM), a hybrid offline-online RL algorithm that implements fidelity
selection based on information gain maximization through a bootstrapping
approach. Theoretical analysis establishes the no-regret property of
MF-HRL-IGM, while empirical evaluations demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Learning the graph underlying a networked system from nodal signals is
crucial to downstream tasks in graph signal processing and machine learning.
The presence of hidden nodes whose signals are not observable might corrupt the
estimated graph. While existing works proposed various robustifications of
vanilla graph learning objectives by explicitly accounting for the presence of
these hidden nodes, a robustness analysis of "naive", hidden-node agnostic
approaches is still underexplored. This work demonstrates that vanilla graph
topology learning methods are implicitly robust to partial observations of
low-pass filtered graph signals. We achieve this theoretical result through
extending the restricted isometry property (RIP) to the Dirichlet energy
function used in graph learning objectives. We show that smoothness-based graph
learning formulation (e.g., the GL-SigRep method) on partial observations can
recover the ground truth graph topology corresponding to the observed nodes.
Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate our findings.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but
their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral
cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning
stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage
post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral
cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage,
Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a
well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of
robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human
supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot
embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on
Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT
and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling
imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to
policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight
that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key
to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination
uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously
practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors
observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These
findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained
foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill
acquisition in robotics. Our project website can be found at
