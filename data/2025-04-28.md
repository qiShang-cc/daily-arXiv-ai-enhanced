### [1] [Quaternion Domain Super MDS for 3D Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17890)
*Keigo Masuoka,Takumi Takahashi,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu,Hideki Ochiai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为QD-SMDS的新型低复杂度三维定位算法，通过将传统SMDS算法从实数域重构到四元数域，利用四元数表示3D坐标，构建了一个融合节点间相对距离和角度信息的秩-1 GEK矩阵，显著提高了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SMDS算法在实数域中处理3D定位问题存在局限性，尤其在测量误差较大时表现不佳。本文旨在通过四元数域重构算法，整合距离和角度信息，以提升定位精度和鲁棒性。

Method: 算法将3D坐标表示为四元数，构建秩-1 GEK矩阵，结合SVD进行低秩截断以最大化降噪效果。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相较于传统SMDS算法，QD-SMDS在测量误差较大的场景下定位精度显著提升。

Conclusion: QD-SMDS通过四元数域重构和GEK矩阵的优化设计，有效提升了3D定位的精度和鲁棒性，尤其在噪声环境下表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a novel low-complexity three-dimensional (3D) localization
algorithm for wireless sensor networks, termed quaternion-domain super
multidimensional scaling (QD-SMDS). This algorithm reformulates the
conventional SMDS, which was originally developed in the real domain, into the
quaternion domain. By representing 3D coordinates as quaternions, the method
enables the construction of a rank-1 Gram edge kernel (GEK) matrix that
integrates both relative distance and angular (phase) information between
nodes, maximizing the noise reduction effect achieved through low-rank
truncation via singular value decomposition (SVD). The simulation results
indicate that the proposed method demonstrates a notable enhancement in
localization accuracy relative to the conventional SMDS algorithm, particularly
in scenarios characterized by substantial measurement errors.

Abstract: Cashierless stores rely on computer vision and RFID tags to associate
shoppers with items, but concealed items placed in backpacks, pockets, or bags
create challenges for theft prevention. We introduce a system that turns
existing RFID tagged items into material sensors by exploiting how different
containers attenuate and scatter RF signals. Using RSSI and phase angle, we
trained a neural network to classify seven common containers. In a simulated
retail environment, the model achieves 89% accuracy with one second samples and
74% accuracy from single reads. Incorporating distance measurements, our system
achieves 82% accuracy across 0.3-2m tag to reader separations. When deployed at
aisle or doorway choke points, the system can flag suspicious events in real
time, prompting camera screening or staff intervention. By combining material
identification with computer vision tracking, our system provides proactive
loss prevention for cashierless retail while utilizing existing infrastructure.

Abstract: High-precision ranging plays a crucial role in future 6G Integrated Sensing
and Communication (ISAC) systems. To improve the ranging performance while
maximizing the resource utilization efficiency, future 6G ISAC networks have to
reuse data payload signals for both communication and sensing, whose inherent
randomness may deteriorate the ranging performance. To address this issue, this
paper investigates the power allocation (PA) design for an OFDM-based ISAC
system under random signaling, aiming to reduce the ranging sidelobe level of
both periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF) of the
ISAC signal. Towards that end, we first derive the closed-form expressions of
the average squared P-ACF and A-ACF, and then propose to minimize the
expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under arbitrary
constellation mapping. We then rigorously prove that the uniform PA scheme
achieves the global minimum of the EISL for both P-ACF and A-ACF. As a step
further, we show that this scheme also minimizes the P-ACF sidelobe level at
every lag. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the P-ACF case with
frequency-domain zero-padding, which is a typical approach to improve the
ranging resolution. We reveal that there exists a tradeoff between sidelobe
level and mainlobe width, and propose a project gradient descent algorithm to
seek a locally optimal PA scheme that reduces the EISL. Finally, we validate
our theoretical findings through extensive simulation results, confirming the
effectiveness of the proposed PA methods in reducing the ranging sidelobe level
for random OFDM signals.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has become a crucial technology
in the development of next-generation wireless communication systems. The
integration of communication and sensing functionalities on a unified spectrum
and infrastructure is expected to enable a variety of emerging use cases. The
introduction of ISAC has led to various new challenges and opportunities
related to the security of wireless communications, resulting in significant
research focused on ISAC system design in relation to physical layer security
(PLS). The shared use of spectrum presents a risk where confidential messages
embedded in probing ISAC signals may be exposed to potentially malicious
sensing targets. This situation creates a tradeoff between sensing performance
and security performance. The sensing functionality of ISAC offers a unique
opportunity for PLS by utilizing sensing information regarding potential
eavesdroppers to design secure PLS schemes. This study examines PLS
methodologies to tackle the specified security challenge associated with ISAC.
The study begins with a brief overview of performance metrics related to PLS
and sensing, as well as the optimization techniques commonly utilized in the
existing literature. A thorough examination of existing literature on PLS for
ISAC is subsequently presented, with the objective of emphasizing the current
state of research. The study concludes by outlining potential avenues for

### [5] [Full-Duplex ISCC for Low-Altitude Networks: Resource Allocation and Coordinated Beamforming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18143)
*Yiyang Chen,Wenchao Liu,Xuhui Zhang,Jinke Ren,Huijun Xing,Shuqiang Wang,Yanyan Shen*

Main category: eess.SP

Conclusion: 论文提出的集成系统和优化算法能有效降低能耗，为低空经济应用提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates an integrated sensing, communication, and computing
system deployed over low-altitude networks for enabling applications within the
low-altitude economy. In the considered system, a full-duplex enabled unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) is dispatched in the airspace, functioning as a
UAV-enabled low-altitude platform (ULAP). The ULAP is capable of achieving
simultaneous information transmission, target sensing, and mobile edge
computing services. To reduce the overall energy consumption of the system
while meeting the sensing beampattern threshold and user computation
requirements, we formulate an energy consumption minimization problem by
jointly optimizing the task allocation, computation resource allocation,
transmit beamforming, and receive beamforming. Since the problem is non-convex
and involves highly coupled variables, we propose an efficient algorithm based
on alternation optimization, which decomposes the original problem into
tractable convex subproblems. Moreover, we analyze the convergence and
complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme saves up to 54.12\% energy consumption performance compared to
the benchmark schemes.

Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Physical-Layer
Authentication (PLA), which focuses on achieving endogenous security and
intelligent identity authentication, has attracted considerable interest. When
compared with Discriminative AI (DAI), Generative AI (GAI) offers several
advantages, such as fingerprint data augmentation, fingerprint denoising and
reconstruction, and protection against adversarial attacks. Inspired by these
innovations, this paper provides a systematic exploration of GAI's integration
into PLA frameworks. We commence with a review of representative authentication
techniques, emphasizing PLA's inherent strengths. Following this, we revisit
four typical GAI models and contrast the limitations of DAI with the potential
of GAI in addressing PLA challenges, including insufficient fingerprint data,
environment noises and inferences, perturbations in fingerprint data, and
complex tasks. Specifically, we delve into providing GAI-enhance methods for
PLA across the data, model, and application layers in detail. Moreover, we
present a case study that combines fingerprint extrapolation, generative
diffusion models, and cooperative nodes to illustrate the superiority of GAI in
bolstering the reliability of PLA compared to DAI. Additionally, we outline
potential future research directions for GAI-based PLA.

### [7] [Multi-Sensor Fusion of Active and Passive Measurements for Extended Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18301)
*Hong Zhu,Alexander Venus,Erik Leitinger,Klaus Witrisal*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种贝叶斯估计算法，结合主动测量和被动测量，通过几何散射模型和多传感器结构，提高了在视线受阻情况下的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线电设备的直接视线（LOS）信号被遮挡的场景中，传统定位方法性能受限。为了克服这一挑战，需要一种能结合多种测量方式的算法。

Method: 提出了一种集成主动测量和被动测量的贝叶斯估计算法，并引入了几何散射模型和多传感器结构，使用扩展对象概率数据关联（PDA）算法。

Result: 该方法在视线受阻条件下显著提高了定位精度，优于传统PDA和仅依赖主动测量的方法。

Conclusion: 结合多种测量方式和扩展对象建模，能够有效改善在复杂环境中的定位性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving robust and reliable
positioning of a radio device carried by an agent, in scenarios where direct
line-of-sight (LOS) radio links are obstructed by the agent. We propose a
Bayesian estimation algorithm that integrates active measurements between the
radio device and anchors with passive measurements in-between anchors
reflecting off the agent. A geometry-based scattering measurement model is
introduced for multi-sensor structures, and multiple object-related
measurements are incorporated to formulate an extended object probabilistic
data association (PDA) algorithm, where the agent that blocks, scatters and
attenuates radio signals is modeled as an extended object (EO). The proposed
approach significantly improves the accuracy during and after obstructed LOS
conditions, outperforming the conventional PDA (which is based on the
point-target-assumption) and methods relying solely on active measurements.

Result: 结果：在两种场景下，提出的系统在BER上优于传统系统（使用MMSE均衡器或预编码）；第三种场景下等价于ZF预编码。

Conclusion: 结论：所提方案能有效提升多用户OTFS系统的性能，特别是在信道状态信息存在误差时仍表现稳健。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-user downlink system for two users based on
the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme. The design
leverages the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of the channels
between the base station and the two users, applying precoding and detection
matrices based on the right and left singular vectors, respectively. We derive
the analytical expressions for three scenarios and present the corresponding
simulation results. These results demonstrate that, in terms of bit error rate
(BER), the proposed system outperforms the conventional multi-user OTFS system
in two scenarios when using minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizers or
precoder, both for perfect channel state information and for a scenario with
channel estimation errors. In the third scenario, the design is equivalent to
zero-forcing (ZF) precoding at the transmitter.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用记忆回归器扩展（MRE）技术的切换系统方法，以延长自主代理在GPS信号缺失情况下的运行时间。该方法通过周期性GPS访问校正累积状态估计误差，解决了现有切换系统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有切换系统方法在GPS信号缺失期间估计误差增加且停留时间条件过于保守，限制了代理的运行效率。

Method: 在GPS可用区间利用MRE技术优化未知系统参数估计，结合Lyapunov稳定性分析，实现更长的GPS缺失区间运行。

Result: 仿真验证了理论结果，实现了停留时间的延长和轨迹跟踪性能的提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了GPS缺失环境下的运行时间和可靠性，同时保持了闭环系统的稳定性。

Abstract: This paper presents a switched systems approach for extending the dwell-time
of an autonomous agent during GPS-denied operation by leveraging memory
regressor extension (MRE) techniques. To maintain accurate trajectory tracking
despite unknown dynamics and environmental disturbances, the agent periodically
acquires access to GPS, allowing it to correct accumulated state estimation
errors. The motivation for this work arises from the limitations of existing
switched system approaches, where increasing estimation errors during
GPS-denied intervals and overly conservative dwell-time conditions restrict the
operational efficiency of the agent. By leveraging MRE techniques during
GPS-available intervals, the developed method refines the estimates of unknown
system parameters, thereby enabling longer and more reliable operation in
GPS-denied environments. A Lyapunov-based switched-system stability analysis
establishes that improved parameter estimates obtained through concurrent
learning allow extended operation in GPS-denied intervals without compromising
closed-loop system stability. Simulation results validate the theoretical
findings, demonstrating dwell-time extensions and enhanced trajectory tracking
performance.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MROP的数据压缩方法，适用于新一代射电干涉阵列的大规模数据降维，通过随机秩一投影和时间调制实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新一代射电干涉阵列产生的数据量巨大，需要高效的数据降维技术以减少存储和计算成本。

Method: 采用MROP方法，通过随机秩一投影和时间调制压缩数据，并分析了噪声统计特性及计算成本。

Result: 在模拟实验中验证了MROP的有效性，适用于多种动态范围和uv覆盖情况，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MROP为大规模射电干涉数据提供了一种高效压缩方案，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: The emerging generation of radio-interferometric (RI) arrays are set to form
images of the sky with a new regime of sensitivity and resolution. This implies
a significant increase in visibility data volumes, scaling as
$\mathcal{O}(Q^{2}B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration intervals
(or batches), calling for efficient data dimensionality reduction techniques.
This paper proposes a new approach to data compression during acquisition,
coined modulated rank-one projection (MROP). MROP compresses the $Q\times Q$
batchwise covariance matrix into a smaller number $P$ of random rank-one
projections and compresses across time by trading $B$ for a smaller number $M$
of random modulations of the ROP measurement vectors. Firstly, we introduce a
dual perspective on the MROP acquisition, which can either be understood as
random beamforming, or as a post-correlation compression. Secondly, we analyse
the noise statistics of MROPs and demonstrate that the random projections
induce a uniform noise level across measurements independently of the
visibility-weighting scheme used. Thirdly, we propose a detailed analysis of
the memory and computational cost requirements across the data acquisition and
image reconstruction stages, with comparison to state-of-the-art dimensionality
reduction approaches. Finally, the MROP model is validated in simulation for
monochromatic intensity imaging, with comparison to the classical and
baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) models, and using the uSARA optimisation
algorithm for image formation. An extensive experimental setup is considered,
with ground-truth images containing diffuse and faint emission and spanning a
wide variety of dynamic ranges, and for a range of $uv$-coverages corresponding
to VLA and MeerKAT observation.

Conclusion: 该数据集有望成为未来计算机视觉任务和LED解码任务的基准，推动事件相机在移动设备上的应用。

Abstract: Optical communication using modulated LEDs (e.g., visible light
communication) is an emerging application for event cameras, thanks to their
high spatio-temporal resolutions. Event cameras can be used simply to decode
the LED signals and also to localize the camera relative to the LED marker
positions. However, there is no public dataset to benchmark the decoding and
localization in various real-world settings. We present, to the best of our
knowledge, the first public dataset that consists of an event camera, a frame
camera, and ground-truth poses that are precisely synchronized with hardware
triggers. It provides various camera motions with various sensitivities in
different scene brightness settings, both indoor and outdoor. Furthermore, we
propose a novel method of localization that leverages the Contrast Maximization
framework for motion estimation and compensation. The detailed analysis and
experimental results demonstrate the advantages of LED-based localization with
events over the conventional AR-marker--based one with frames, as well as the
efficacy of the proposed method in localization. We hope that the proposed
dataset serves as a future benchmark for both motion-related classical computer
vision tasks and LED marker decoding tasks simultaneously, paving the way to
broadening applications of event cameras on mobile devices.

Conclusion: 通过动态资源估计和优化决策，所提方法显著提升了eVTOL机群的任务执行性能，为未来的城市空中交通提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, pivotal to Advanced
Air Mobility (AAM), are emerging as a transformative transportation paradigm
with the potential to redefine urban and regional mobility. While these systems
offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely
heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time
navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating
robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves
offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight
path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum
conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to
maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer
promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit
for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying
nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which
leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates,
excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these
challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms
that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy
consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with
primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed
Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions,
selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and
temporal constraints.

TL;DR: 提出一种半Transformer神经网络（STNet）用于预测水下声速剖面（SSP），无需实时数据测量，通过历史时间序列数据实现准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSP测量方法存在空间覆盖有限或依赖实时数据的精度问题，STNet旨在解决这些限制，实现独立于实时测量的高精度长期预测。

Method: 设计STNet，结合优化的自注意力机制和时间编码，捕捉历史声速时间序列的长期依赖，高效预测当前或未来SSP。

Result: 实验表明，STNet在预测精度和计算效率上优于现有模型，适用于全深度海洋SSP长期预测。

Conclusion: STNet为高精度长期SSP预测提供了有效解决方案，展现了在海洋声学通信定位中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Real time acquisition of accurate underwater sound velocity profile (SSP) is
crucial for tracking the propagation trajectory of underwater acoustic signals,
making it play a key role in ocean communication positioning. SSPs can be
directly measured by instruments or inverted leveraging sound field data.
Although measurement techniques provide a good accuracy, they are constrained
by limited spatial coverage and require substantial time investment. The
inversion method based on real-time measurement of acoustic field data improves
operational efficiency, but loses the accuracy of SSP estimation and suffers
from limited spatial applicability due to its stringent requirements for ocean
observation infrastructure. To achieve accurate long-term ocean SSP estimation
independent of real-time underwater data measurements, we propose a
Semi-Transformer neural network (STNet) specifically designed for simulating
sound velocity distribution patterns from the perspective of time series
prediction. The proposed network architecture incorporates an optimized
self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies within historical sound velocity time-series data, facilitating
accurate estimation of current SSPs or prediction of future SSPs. Through
architectural optimization of the Transformer framework and integration of a
time encoding mechanism, STNet could effectively improve computational
efficiency. Comparative experimental results reveal that STNet outperforms
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy and maintain good computational
efficiency, demonstrating its potential for enabling accurate long-term
full-depth ocean SSP forecasting.

Method: 提出分层无小区（HCF）架构：减少分布式AP数量，将天线集中至中心基站（cBS），并作为AP协调器。推导了上行/下行频谱效率的闭式表达式，基于多天线AP、导频污染和相关衰落信道，并开发了最大最小公平性算法优化功率控制。

Result: HCF的95%用户频谱效率接近无小区系统，蜂窝边缘用户速率提升超100倍，且 fronthaul 复杂性和成本显著降低。功率控制算法在上下行中分别实现超70%的传输功率节省，提升公平性和系统容量。

Conclusion: HCF架构在性能与成本间取得了平衡，特别适合资源受限场景，为未来网络部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In traditional cellular networks, users at the cell edge often suffer from
poor quality of service (QoS) due to large distance-dependent path loss and
severe inter-cell interference. While cell-free (CF) massive multi-input
multi-out (MIMO) mitigates this issue by distributing access points (APs) to
ensure uniform QoS, the deployment of numerous distributed APs and a fronthaul
network incurs high infrastructure costs. To balance performance and cost
efficiency, this article proposes a simplified design called hierarchical
cell-free (HCF) massive MIMO. The key idea is to reduce the number of APs, thus
minimizing the scale of the fronthaul network. The antennas from the
decommissioned APs are aggregated at a central base station (cBS), which also
serves as the coordinator for distributed APs. We derive closed-form
expressions for uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) for HCF, CF, and
cellular massive MIMO under pilot contamination and correlated fading channels,
considering the use of multi-antenna APs. Numerical results confirm that the
hierarchical architecture achieves $95\%$-likely per-user SE comparable to CF,
enhancing cell-edge user rates in cellular systems by over 100 times, while
significantly reducing the complexity and cost of the fronthaul network in CF.
We develop max-min fairness algorithms for joint power control of the cBS and
APs in the downlink, and the users in the uplink. These algorithms not only
boost fairness and system capacity but also dramatically lower transmission
power, e.g., achieving over $70\%$ savings in uplink, particularly beneficial
for battery-powered mobile devices.

Motivation: 静态网络的信息新鲜度已较为了解，但动态拓扑对信息新鲜度的影响尚未充分研究，尤其是节点行为对整体网络性能的可能负面影响。

Method: 采用两状态CTMC过程模拟网络拓扑切换，通过版本年龄指标量化信息新鲜度，分析不同CTMC切换速率对性能的影响。

Result: 当CTMC切换速率快于最优静态网络的版本年龄时，动态网络的信息新鲜度接近最优静态网络；少数节点的行为可能显著降低整体网络性能。

Conclusion: 动态拓扑网络中，快速切换能优化信息新鲜度，但需注意节点行为的潜在负面影响，提出典型节点集定义以进一步研究。

Abstract: We consider a source that shares updates with a network of $n$ gossiping
nodes. The network's topology switches between two arbitrary topologies, with
switching governed by a two-state continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) process.
Information freshness is well-understood for static networks. This work
evaluates the impact of time-varying connections on information freshness. In
order to quantify the freshness of information, we use the version age of
information metric. If the two networks have static long-term average version
ages of $f_1(n)$ and $f_2(n)$ with $f_1(n) \ll f_2(n)$, then the version age of
the varying-topologies network is related to $f_1(n)$, $f_2(n)$, and the
transition rates in the CTMC. If the transition rates in the CTMC are faster
than $f_1(n)$, the average version age of the varying-topologies network is
$f_1(n)$. Further, we observe that the behavior of a vanishingly small fraction
of nodes can severely impact the long-term average version age of a network in
a negative way. This motivates the definition of a typical set of nodes in the
network. We evaluate the impact of fast and slow CTMC transition rates on the
typical set of nodes.
