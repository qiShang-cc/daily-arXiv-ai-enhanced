The proposed method changes the interference power at specific\nchannels to modulate a low-rate on-off keying signal. This is achieved by\nappropriately setting the radiation pattern of front-end components of a\ntransmitter, i.e., analog beamforming weights or metasurface configuration. The\npaper investigates theoretical performance limits and analyzes the efficiency\nin terms of sum rate. Bit error rate simulation results are closely matched\nwith theoretical findings. The initial findings indicate that the proposed\ntechnique can be instrumental in providing reduced capability communication\nusing minimal power consumption in 6G networks."}

To date,\nno study has addressed such impairments caused by faulty RIS elements in ISAC\nsystems. This work aims to fill the gap. First, to quantify the impact of\nfaulty elements on ISAC performance, we derive the misspecified Cram\\'er-Rao\nbound (MCRB) for sensing parameter estimation and\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) for communication quality. Then,\nto mitigate the performance loss caused by faulty elements, we jointly design\nthe remaining functional RIS phase shifts and transmit beamforming to minimize\nthe MCRB, subject to the communication SINR and transmit power constraints. The\nresulting optimization problem is highly non-convex due to the intricate\nstructure of the MCRB expression and constant-modulus constraint imposed on\nRIS. To address this, we reformulate it into a more tractable form and propose\na block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that incorporates\nmajorization-minimization (MM), successive convex approximation (SCA), and\npenalization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed\napproach reduces the MCRB performance loss by 24.36% on average compared to the\ncase where the presence of faulty elements is ignored.

Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive\nstudy on several key factors affecting EE performance, including the number of\nRIS elements, the types of reconfigurable elements, reconfiguration\nresolutions, and the maximum transmit power. To accurately capture the power\ncharacteristics of RISs, we adopt more practical power consumption models for\nthree commonly used reconfigurable elements in RISs: PIN diodes, varactor\ndiodes, and radio frequency (RF) switches. These different elements may result\nin RIS systems exhibiting significantly different energy efficiencies (EEs),\neven when their spectral efficiencies (SEs) are similar. Considering discrete\nphases implemented at most RISs in practice, which makes their optimization\nNP-hard, we develop a nested alternating optimization framework to maximize EE,\nconsisting of an outer integer-based optimization for discrete RIS phase\nreconfigurations and a nested non-convex optimization for continuous transmit\npower allocation within each iteration. Extensive comparisons with multiple\nbenchmark schemes validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed\nframework.
