Generally, target tracking in automotive radars is challenging due\nto radar field of view (FOV) misalignment, nonlinear coordinate conversion, and\nself-positioning errors of the ego-vehicle, which are caused by platform\nmotion. These issues significantly hinder the implementation of MF-TBD in\nautomotive radars. To address these challenges, a new MF-TBD detection\narchitecture is first proposed. It can adaptively adjust the detection\nthreshold value based on the existence of moving targets within the radar FOV.\nSince the implementation of MF-TBD necessitates the inclusion of position,\nvelocity, and yaw angle information of the ego-vehicle, each with varying\ndegrees of measurement error, we further propose a multi-frame energy\nintegration strategy for moving-platform radar and accurately derive the target\nenergy integration path functions. The self-positioning errors of the\nego-vehicle, which are usually not considered in some previous target tracking\napproaches, are well addressed. Numerical simulations and experimental results\nwith real radar data demonstrate large detection and tracking gains over\nstandard automotive radar processing in weak target environments."}
