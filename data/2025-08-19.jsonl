As these technologies evolve\ntoward higher levels of autonomy, the need for integrated systems that\nseamlessly support human involvement in decision-making becomes increasingly\ncritical. Certain scenarios necessitate human involvement, including those\nwhere the vehicle is unable to identify an object or element in the scene, and\nas such cannot take independent action. Therefore, situational awareness is\nessential to mitigate potential risks during a takeover, where a driver must\nassume control and autonomy from the vehicle. The need for driver attention is\nimportant to avoid collisions with external agents and ensure a smooth\ntransition during takeover operations. This paper explores the integration of\nattention redirection techniques, such as gaze manipulation through targeted\nvisual and auditory cues, to help drivers maintain focus on emerging hazards\nand reduce target fixation in semi-autonomous driving scenarios.

We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and\ndelineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models,\nencompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of\nintegration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning\nfrom execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this\nfoundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models:\n(1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning,\ntraining-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model\nintegration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating\narchitectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks\nthat support their development; (3) identification of promising directions,\nincluding memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent\ncooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent\nadvances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research\nfragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of\nstudies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide\na regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress:\nhttps://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation."}

Although training data are collected from\ndiverse camera perspectives, the models typically predict end-effector poses\nwithin the robot base coordinate frame, resulting in spatial inconsistencies.\nTo mitigate this limitation, we introduce the Observation-Centric VLA (OC-VLA)\nframework, which grounds action predictions directly in the camera observation\nspace. Leveraging the camera's extrinsic calibration matrix, OC-VLA transforms\nend-effector poses from the robot base coordinate system into the camera\ncoordinate system, thereby unifying prediction targets across heterogeneous\nviewpoints. This lightweight, plug-and-play strategy ensures robust alignment\nbetween perception and action, substantially improving model resilience to\ncamera viewpoint variations. The proposed approach is readily compatible with\nexisting VLA architectures, requiring no substantial modifications.\nComprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation\ntasks demonstrate that OC-VLA accelerates convergence, enhances task success\nrates, and improves cross-view generalization. The code will be publicly\navailable."}

Using the Wasserstein-1\ndistance as a quantitative measure of non-Gaussianity, we derive upper bounds\non the distance between the appropriately scaled output and a standard normal\ndistribution. These bounds are obtained via Stein's method and depend\nexplicitly on the system's impulse response and the dependence structure of the\ninput process. We show that when the dominant pole of the system approaches the\nedge of stability and the input satisfies one of the following conditions: (i)\nindependence, (ii) positive correlation with a real and positive dominant pole,\nor (iii) sufficient correlation decay, the output converges to a standard\nnormal distribution at rate $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$. We also present counterexamples\nwhere convergence fails, thereby motivating the stated assumptions. Our results\nprovide a rigorous foundation for the widespread observation that outputs of\nlow-pass LTI systems tend to be approximately Gaussian."}

Traditional methods, which treat\nnavigation and manipulation as separate tasks, often fail in such\n'manipulate-to-navigate' scenarios, as obstacles must be removed before\nnavigation. In these cases, active interaction with the environment is required\nto clear obstacles while ensuring sufficient space for movement. To address the\nmanipulate-to-navigate problem, we propose a reinforcement learning-based\napproach for learning manipulation actions that facilitate subsequent\nnavigation. Our method combines manipulability priors to focus the robot on\nhigh manipulability body positions with affordance maps for selecting\nhigh-quality manipulation actions. By focusing on feasible and meaningful\nactions, our approach reduces unnecessary exploration and allows the robot to\nlearn manipulation strategies more effectively. We present two new\nmanipulate-to-navigate simulation tasks called Reach and Door with the Boston\nDynamics Spot robot. The first task tests whether the robot can select a good\nhand position in the target area such that the robot base can move effectively\nforward while keeping the end effector position fixed. The second task requires\nthe robot to move a door aside in order to clear the navigation path. Both of\nthese tasks need first manipulation and then navigating the base forward.\nResults show that our method allows a robot to effectively interact with and\ntraverse dynamic environments. Finally, we transfer the learned policy to a\nreal Boston Dynamics Spot robot, which successfully performs the Reach task."}

We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking\nbrief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is\nachieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in\ntime series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent\nadvances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and\nnonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially\nthe speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks.

However, most neural solvers are trained to tackle VRP instances in a\nrelatively monotonous context, e.g., simplifying VRPs by using Euclidean\ndistance between nodes and adhering to a single problem size, which harms their\noff-the-shelf application in different scenarios. To enhance their versatility,\nthis paper presents a novel lifelong learning framework that incrementally\ntrains a neural solver to manage VRPs in distinct contexts. Specifically, we\npropose a lifelong learner (LL), exploiting a Transformer network as the\nbackbone, to solve a series of VRPs. The inter-context self-attention mechanism\nis proposed within LL to transfer the knowledge obtained from solving preceding\nVRPs into the succeeding ones. On top of that, we develop a dynamic context\nscheduler (DCS), employing the cross-context experience replay to further\nfacilitate LL looking back on the attained policies of solving preceding VRPs.\nExtensive results on synthetic and benchmark instances (problem sizes up to\n18k) show that our LL is capable of discovering effective policies for tackling\ngeneric VRPs in varying contexts, which outperforms other neural solvers and\nachieves the best performance for most VRPs."}

Although stochastic noise has been\nthe primary form of modeling uncertainty in such systems, these formulations\nmight fall short in addressing uncertainties that are deterministic in nature\nor simply lack probabilistic data. To ensure safety under such scenarios, we\nemploy the concept of robust constraints that must hold for all possible\nuncertainty realizations lying inside a bounded set. Nevertheless, standard\nrobust optimization approaches become intractable due to the large number or\nnon-convexity of the constraints involved in safe multi-agent control. To\naddress this, we introduce novel robust reformulations that significantly\nreduce complexity without compromising safety. The applicability of the\nframework is further broadened to address both deterministic and stochastic\nuncertainties by incorporating robust chance constraints and distribution\nsteering techniques. To achieve scalability, we derive a distributed approach\nbased on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), supported by a\nconvergence study that accounts for the underlying non-convexity. In addition,\ncomputational complexity bounds highlighting the efficiency of the proposed\nframeworks against standard approaches are presented. Finally, the robustness\nand scalability of the framework is demonstrated through extensive simulation\nresults across diverse scenarios, including environments with nonconvex\nobstacles and up to 246 agents."}

We demonstrate that an individual with\ntetraplegia, implanted with intracortical BCI electrodes in the posterior\nparietal cortex (PPC) and the hand knob region of the motor cortex (MC), reacts\nat least as fast and precisely as motor intact participants, and drives a\nsimulated vehicle as proficiently as the same control group. This BCI\nparticipant, living in California, could also remotely drive a Ford Mustang\nMach-E vehicle in Michigan. Our first teledriving task relied on cursor control\nfor speed and steering in a closed urban test facility. However, the final BCI\nsystem added click control for full-stop braking and thus enabled bimanual\ncursor-and-click control for both simulated driving through a virtual town with\ntraffic and teledriving through an obstacle course without traffic in the real\nworld. We also demonstrate the safety and feasibility of BCI-controlled\ndriving.
