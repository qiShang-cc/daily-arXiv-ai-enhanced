The MLA architecture extends the aperture length of a standard\nULA without adding additional antennas, thereby enabling near-field\nbeamfocusing without increasing processing complexity. Unlike conventional\nfar-field beamforming, near-field beamfocusing enables simultaneous data\ntransmission to multiple users at different distances in the same angular\ninterval, offering significant multiplexing gains. We present a detailed\nmathematical analysis of the beamwidth and beamdepth achievable with the MLA\nand show that by appropriately selecting the number of antennas in each\nconstituent ULA, ideal near-field beamfocusing can be realized. In addition, we\npropose a computationally efficient localization method that fuses estimates\nfrom each ULA, enabling efficient parametric channel estimation.

Channel\nFingerprint (CF), as an emerging enabling technology for environment-aware\ncommunication, provides channel-related knowledge for potential locations\nwithin the target communication area. However, due to the limited availability\nof practical devices for sensing environmental information and measuring\nchannel-related knowledge, most of the acquired environmental information and\nCF are coarse-grained, insufficient to guide the design of wireless\ntransmissions. To address this, this paper proposes a deep conditional\ngenerative learning approach, namely a customized conditional generative\ndiffusion model (CDiff). The proposed CDiff simultaneously refines\nenvironmental information and CF, reconstructing a fine-grained CF that\nincorporates environmental information, referred to as EnvCF, from its\ncoarse-grained counterpart. Experimental results show that the proposed\napproach significantly improves the performance of EnvCF construction compared\nto the baselines."}

Binary bits\ncan be encoded in two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted securely from\npoint to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than\nthe wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Consequently, most research in this\narea has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short\n(~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not\ntoo inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the\nwavelength is much larger (typically > 1 cm). That makes a microwave\nultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, we report such\na switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral\ndimension) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an \"artificial\nmagnonic crystal\". A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with\nsuitable electrodes excites spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon\ncoupling, resulting in radiation of electromagnetic waves via magnon-photon\ncoupling. The polarization of the beam radiated in a given direction at a given\nfrequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by changing the direction of SAW\npropagation in the substrate to implement the polarization switch."}

Specifically, the\nIPA can enable polarforming by adaptively controlling the antenna's\npolarization electrically as well as its position/rotation mechanically, so as\nto effectively exploit polarization and spatial diversity to reconfigure\nwireless channels for improving sensing and communication performance. We study\nan IPA-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that\nutilizes user location sensing to facilitate communication between an\nIPA-equipped base station (BS) and IPA-equipped users. First, we model the IPA\nchannel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming vectors and antenna\npositions/rotations. We then propose a two-timescale ISAC protocol, where in\nthe slow timescale, user localization is first performed, followed by the\noptimization of the BS antennas' positions and rotations based on the sensed\nuser locations; subsequently, in the fast timescale, transceiver polarforming\nis adapted to cater to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), with\nthe optimized BS antennas' positions and rotations. We propose a new\npolarforming-based user localization method that uses a structured time-domain\npattern of pilot-polarforming vectors to extract the common stable components\nin the IPA channel across different polarizations based on the parallel factor\n(PARAFAC) tensor model. Moreover, we maximize the achievable average sum-rate\nof users by jointly optimizing the fast-timescale transceiver polarforming,\nincluding phase shifts and amplitude variations, along with the slow-timescale\nantenna rotations and positions at the BS.

In DMAs, holographic beamforming is achieved\nthrough tunable elements by Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH),\nsignificantly reducing the need for radio-frequency (RF) chains and analog\ncircuitry.

We propose a holographic beamforming algorithm based on\nthe Generalized Method of Lorentzian-Constrained Holography (GMLCH), which\noptimizes DMA weights, yielding flexibility for using various LCH techniques to\ntackle the aforementioned trade-offs.
