This paper proposes a novel fluid antenna system (FAS)-active\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) framework that transforms multipath\neffects from a hindrance into a resource for enhanced localization. By\nsynergistically combining the signal amplification capabilities of ARIS with\nthe spatial diversity enabled by FAS, the proposed system achieves robust 3D\nuser equipment (UE) positioning -- without relying on auxiliary information\nsuch as time-of-arrival (ToA) or frequency diversity. The system exploits both\nline-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components through a tailored\nsignal decoupling strategy. We design novel UE pilot sequences and ARIS phase\nconfigurations to effectively separate LoS and NLoS channels, enabling\nindependent parameter estimation. A multi-stage estimation algorithm is then\napplied: the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm estimates\nangle-of-arrival (AoA) from the direct path, while maximum likelihood\nestimation with interior-point refinement recovers cascaded channel parameters\nfrom the reflected path. Finally, geometric triangulation using least-squares\nestimation determines the UE's 3D position based on the extracted AoA\ninformation. Comprehensive performance analysis, including the derivation of\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao bounds for both channel and position estimation, establishes\ntheoretical benchmarks. Simulation results confirm that the proposed FAS-ARIS\nframework achieves near-optimal localization accuracy while maintaining\nrobustness in rich multipath environments -- effectively turning conventional\nlocalization challenges into advantages."}

We present a framework for\ngenerating pointing gestures in embodied agents by combining imitation and\nreinforcement learning. Using a small motion capture dataset, our method learns\na motor control policy that produces physically valid, naturalistic gestures\nwith high referential accuracy. We evaluate the approach against supervised\nlearning and retrieval baselines in both objective metrics and a virtual\nreality referential game with human users. Results show that our system\nachieves higher naturalness and accuracy than state-of-the-art supervised\nmodels, highlighting the promise of imitation-RL for communicative gesture\ngeneration and its potential application to robots."}

While classical analysis\nfocuses on the bias-variance trade-off, we present a more foundational\nconstraint. This result is model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and is valid for\nboth parametric and non-parametric problems, Bayesian and frequentist\nframeworks. We propose to classify the estimators into three primary power\nregimes. We theoretically establish that any estimator operating in the\n`power-dominant regime' incurs an unavoidable mean-squared error penalty,\nmaking it structurally prone to sub-optimal performance. We propose a\n`safe-zone law' and make this diagnostic intuitive through two safe-zone maps.\nOne map is a geometric visualization analogous to a receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve for estimators, and the other map shows that the safe-zone\ncorresponds to a bounded optimization problem, while the forbidden\n`power-dominant zone' represents an unbounded optimization landscape. This\nframework reframes estimator design as a path optimization problem, providing\nnew theoretical underpinnings for regularization and inspiring novel design\nphilosophies."}

NAVMOE combines multiple specialized models\nfor specific terrain types, each of which can be either a classical model-based\nor a learning-based approach that predicts traversability for specific terrain\ntypes. NAVMOE dynamically weights the contributions of different models based\non the input environment through a gating network.

To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel\narchitecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.\nWe design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic\ninter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and\nevidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain\ncontextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves\n26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific\nMoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models."}

To assist in this matter, automated assembly control\nusing computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs\nassociated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision\nalgorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive\ntraining, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers\nthe potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its\npractical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In\nthis work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient\nvisual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation\nbased on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The\nresults demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in\nmanufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)\nup to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear\nsystem components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when\ntransferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research\nhighlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable\npipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing\nresource-efficient visual assembly control solutions."}

By using the dual\nformulation of the navigation problem, we incorporate CDFs into the MPC\nframework, ensuring both convergence and safety in a discrete-time setting.\nThese density functions are endowed with a physical interpretation, where the\nassociated measure signifies the occupancy of system trajectories. Leveraging\nthis occupancy-based perspective, we synthesize safety-critical controllers\nusing the proposed MPC-CDF framework. We illustrate the safety properties of\nthis framework using a unicycle model and compare it with a control barrier\nfunction-based method. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated in the\nautonomous safe navigation of an underwater vehicle, which avoids complex and\narbitrary obstacles while achieving the desired level of safety."}

Shapes are\nremembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and\nprocedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real\nlife the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing\npatterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally\nminimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes\nare treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,\nasking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,\nsituational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not\nvague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,\nmodeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging\nphenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such\nspecificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical\naims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and\nworthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA\nexample of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied\nmore broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI."}
