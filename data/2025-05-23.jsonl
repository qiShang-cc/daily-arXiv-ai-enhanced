Reconfigurable Intelligent\nSurfaces (RIS) are emerging as key enablers in 6G networks for joint sensing\nand communication. However, RIS faces significant challenges in\nNon-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and multipath propagation, particularly in\nlocalization scenarios, where detecting NLOS conditions is crucial for ensuring\nnot only reliable results and increased connectivity but also the safety of\nsmart factory personnel. This study introduces an AI-assisted framework\nemploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) customized for accurate\nLine-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) classification to enhance\nRIS-based localization using measured, synthetic, mixed-measured, and\nmixed-synthetic experimental data, that is, original, augmented, slightly\nnoisy, and highly noisy data, respectively.

This\npaper will show that a quaternion can be used to represent both the optical\nsignal and the waveplate component it passes through, replacing the Jones\nvector and the Jones matrix. The quaternion description is easier to manipulate\nthan the matrix-vector description; for example it can be inverted. As well as\nthe Jones vector, the state of polarization (SOP) of an optical signal is often\ndescribed as a three-dimensional vector on the Poincar\\'e sphere, or as a\npolarization ellipse, and it will be shown how these three forms are closely\nrelated to the quaternion representation. Similarly, the action of a waveplate\nmay be represented as a rotation about an axis on the Poincar\\'e sphere, and\nthat rotation is shown to have a logarithm-exponential relationship to the\nwaveplate's quaternion. The paper presents rules to decide if two optical\nsignals are aligned or orthogonal in phase or in polarization from their\nquaternions, and presents the quaternion operations to change the phase or\nchange the SOP. Light passing through a system of waveplates is written as a\nproduct of quaternions, and it can be hard to simplify or manipulate that\nexpression because quaternion multiplication does not commute. The paper brings\ntogether several mathematical tools that allow such a quaternion product to be\nrearranged, including the new idea of partial conjugation. Finally, a worked\nexample is included of the quaternion mathematics applied to a waveplate\nproblem that has not been solved before. It is shown that an endless optical\nphase shifter can be built using three rotatable waveplates, and equations for\nthe angles of rotation are derived to produce the desired phase shift for given\ninput and output SOPs."}

Force sensing is important for feedback control, interaction, and\nmonitoring in the EA system. However, EA force monitoring often relies on bulky\nand expensive sensors, increasing the complexity and weight of the entire\nsystem. This paper presents an acoustic-pressure-based method to monitor EA\nforces without contacting the adhesion pad. When the EA pad is driven by a\nbipolar square-wave voltage to adhere a conductive object, periodic acoustic\npulses arise from the EA system. We employed a microphone to capture these\nacoustic pressure signals and investigate the influence of peak pressure\nvalues. Results show that the peak value of acoustic pressure increased with\nthe mass and contact area of the adhered object, as well as with the amplitude\nand frequency of the driving voltage. We applied this technique to mass\nestimation of various objects and simultaneous monitoring of two EA systems.\nThen, we integrated this technique into an EA end effector that enables\nmonitoring the change of adhered object mass during transport. The proposed\ntechnique offers a low-cost, non-contact, and multi-object monitoring solution\nfor EA end effectors in handling tasks."}

Moreover, the high number of\ncommunication flows creates the necessity of processing huge amounts of data.\nFurthermore, the connected devices are heterogeneous in nature, having\ndifferent computational capacities. For this reason, in this work we propose an\nimage-based representation of network traffic which allows to realize a compact\nsummary of the current network conditions with 1-second time windows. The\nproposed representation highlights the presence of anomalies thus reducing the\nneed for complex processing architectures. Finally, we present an unsupervised\nlearning approach which effectively detects the presence of anomalies.

The proposed method formulates the calibration\nproblem as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem, treating both the\ncalibration parameters and orientation trajectory of the sensors as unknowns.\nThis formulation enables efficient optimization with closed-form derivatives.\nThe method is compared against two state-of-the-art approaches in terms of\ncomputational complexity and estimation accuracy. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower root mean square error in\ncalibration parameters while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.\nFurther validation through real-world experiments confirms the practical\nbenefits of our approach: it effectively reduces position drift in a magnetic\nfield-aided inertial navigation system by more than a factor of two on most\ndatasets. Moreover, the proposed method calibrated 30 magnetometers in less\nthan 2 minutes. The contributions include a new calibration method, an analysis\nof existing methods, and a comprehensive empirical evaluation.

While industry concepts, such as ETSI's\nExperiential Networked Intelligence (ENI), envision LAM-driven agents for\nadaptive network slicing and intent-based management, practical implementations\nstill face challenges in protocol literacy and real-world deployment. This\npaper presents an end-to-end demonstration of a LAM that generates\nstandards-compliant, ASN.1-encoded Radio Resource Control (RRC) messages as\npart of control-plane procedures inside a gNB. We treat RRC messaging as a\ndomain-specific language and fine-tune a decoder-only transformer model (LLaMA\nclass) using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on RRC messages\nlinearized to retain their ASN.1 syntactic structure before standard byte-pair\nencoding tokenization. This enables combinatorial generalization over RRC\nprotocol states while minimizing training overhead. On 30k field-test\nrequest-response pairs, our 8 B model achieves a median cosine similarity of\n0.97 with ground-truth messages on an edge GPU -- a 61 % relative gain over a\nzero-shot LLaMA-3 8B baseline -- indicating substantially improved structural\nand semantic RRC fidelity. Overall, our results show that LAMs, when augmented\nwith Radio Access Network (RAN)-specific reasoning, can directly orchestrate\ncontrol-plane procedures, representing a stepping stone toward the AI-native\nair-interface paradigm. Beyond RRC emulation, this work lays the groundwork for\nfuture AI-native wireless standards."}

The OP encoding is based on transforming a (univariate)\nsignal into a symbolic sequence of OPs, where each OP represents the number of\npermutations needed to order a small subset of the signal's magnitudes. This\nimplies that OPs are conceptually clear, methodologically simple to implement,\nrobust to noise, and can be applied to short signals. Moreover, they simplify\nthe statistical analyses that can be carried out on a signal, such as entropy\nand complexity quantifications. However, because of the relative ordering,\ninformation about the magnitude of the signal at each timestamp is lost -- this\nbeing one of the major drawbacks in the method. Here, we propose a way to use\nthe signal magnitudes discarded in the OP encoding as a complementary variable\nto its permutation entropy. To illustrate our approach, we analyse synthetic\ntrajectories from logistic and H{\\'e}non maps -- with and without added noise\n-- and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from rats in different\nsleep-wake states. Our results show that, when complementing the permutation\nentropy with the variability in the signal magnitudes, the characterisation of\nthe dynamical behaviours of the maps and the sleep-wake states is improved.\nThis implies that our approach can be useful for feature engineering and\nimproving AI classifiers, where typical machine learning algorithms need\ncomplementary signal features as inputs to improve classification accuracy."}
