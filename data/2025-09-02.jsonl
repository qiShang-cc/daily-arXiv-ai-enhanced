Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through\nalgorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which\ndirectly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is\na dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the\nemerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing\n(VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a\ndistinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we\nestablish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing\n(AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each\narithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model\nexploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization\nproblem to strike balance between computing performance and computational\ncomplexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to\nsolve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a\ncase study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary\nbetween computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60%\nsum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared\nto the traditional fixed-length methods."}

Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which\nadjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM\ncharacteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing\nstudies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores\nits application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station\nserves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability\nparadigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired\nbeampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state\nselection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set\nof patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM\nprecoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case\nwe derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM\nprecoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and\npropose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern\nselection.

We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol\ndetection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios\nfor the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED)\nscheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \\emph{virtual} pilots to further\nimprove the CE and data detection accuracy.\n  Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE\nand data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in\nuncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier\nequalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while\nOFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS\nperform similarly, and they outperform OFDM.

We formulate a joint clustering and\nradio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received\npower across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem\ninto two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on\ntheir spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii)\nantenna element placement optimization.

Our\nobjective is to optimize tracking quality by minimizing uncertainty in target\nstate estimation through efficient robot-to-target assignment. By leveraging\nmatroid theory, we propose a greedy assignment algorithm that dynamically\nallocates robots to targets to maximize tracking quality. The algorithm\nguarantees constant-factor approximation bounds of 1/3 for arbitrary tracking\nquality functions and 1/2 for submodular functions, while maintaining\npolynomial-time complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's\neffectiveness in accurately estimating and tracking targets over extended\nperiods.

Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of the subtask algorithms and the hierarchical fusion strategy."}

We propose a latent\ndiffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,\nincluding the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.\nCompleting the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the\nambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a\nregression-based formulation to predict a single \"mode\" for occluded and\nout-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to\ncapture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem\npartially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,\nreconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the\ninput views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a\ndistribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single\ninput image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a\nVariational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a\nself-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method\ngenerates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to\ncomplete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings."}

It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and\ncorrelate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the\nsearch space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby\naffecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search\nusing several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in\nMulti-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible\nheuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original\nversion does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm\nthat requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time\nsolution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime\nversion that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually\nimproves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime\nRepairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*\nconcepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and\ncompleteness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.\nFurthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain\nand sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms."}

However, standard gradient\nguidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward\nlandscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios\ninvolving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and\nmulti-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches\nrequire task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time\nflexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion\nPlanner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances\nexploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame\ntest-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:\n(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle\nguidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined\nthrough fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the\nlimitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and\nharnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only\npretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three\ndiverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze\nmulti-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches on all tasks.
