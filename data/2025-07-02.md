### [1] [Fast Simulation of Damage Diffusion Distribution in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00294)
*Amir Javadi Rad,Amirafshar Moshtaghpour,Dongdong Chen,Angus I. Kirkland*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了用于模拟STEM中损伤扩散过程的高效C++框架，结合数值计算、可视化和多线程以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解电子束损伤机制对于STEM成像至关重要，但现有模拟工具计算成本高，缺乏效率。

Method: 开发了一个高性能C++框架，结合高效数值计算和多线程技术，支持损伤扩散过程的快速模拟和可视化。

Result: 该框架在保持精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效的工具，有助于深入理解STEM中的电子束损伤机制。

Abstract: Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) is a critical tool for
imaging the properties of materials and biological specimens at atomic scale,
yet our understanding of relevant electron beam damage mechanisms is
incomplete. Recent studies suggest that certain types of damage can be modelled
as a diffusion process. However, numerical simulation of such diffusion
processes has remained computationally intensive. This work introduces a
high-performance C++ framework for simulating damage diffusion process in STEM
that combines efficient numerical computation, advanced visualisations, and
multithreading to achieve efficient runtime while maintaining accuracy.

### [2] [Quadrature Over-the-Air-Computing for Multimodal Dual-Stream Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00508)
*Hyeon Seok Rou,Kengo Ando,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu,David González G*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的Q-OTAC框架，通过利用复杂信号的IQ分量，在单次传输中同时计算两个独立函数或数据流，有效提升计算速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OTAC方案只能在单次传输中计算单一函数，无法满足多模态高效计算的需求。

Method: 采用IQ分量编码两个独立数据流，并在接入点使用低复杂度的IQ解耦组合器独立恢复每个流。

Result: 仿真结果显示Q-OTAC能够实现双功能聚合（如并行求和与乘积），显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: Q-OTAC框架兼容现有技术，有望支持B5G应用的多模态高效计算需求。

Abstract: We propose a novel quadrature over-the-air computing (Q-OTAC) framework that
enables the simultaneously computation of two independent functions and/or data
stream within a single transmission. In contrast to conventional OTAC schemes,
where a single function is computed by treating each complex signal as a single
component, the proposed Q-OTAC exploits both in-phase and quadrature (IQ)
components of a complex signal, encoding two distinct functions and/or data
streams at the edge devices (EDs) and employing a novel low-complexity
IQ-decoupled combiner at the access point (AP) to independently recover each
stream, which effectively doubles the computation rate. A key strength of this
framework lies in its simplicity and broad compatibility: the extension into
the quadrature domain is conceptually straightforward, yet remakably powerful,
allowing seamless integration into existing OTAC techniques. Simulation results
validate the effectiveness of this approach, including the first demonstration
of dual-function aggregation (e.g., parallel summation and product),
highlighting the potential of Q-OTAC for enabling multi-modal and
high-efficiency beyond fifth generation (B5G) applications.

### [3] [Fair Rate Maximization for Fluid Antenna Relay (FAR)-assisted Multi-user MISO Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00529)
*Ruopeng Xu,Zhaohui Yang,Ting Zhang,Mingzhe Chen,Chen Zhu,Zhaoyang Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了多用户上行链路MISO无线系统中FAR辅助下的最大-最小速率最大化问题，提出了一种基于SCA的交替算法，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注FAS总速率最大化，可能导致弱用户速率损失严重，因此提出确保公平性的最小速率最大化方案。

Method: 通过联合优化FA的位置（满足最小距离、最大发射功率和可行区域约束），提出基于SCA的交替算法。

Result: 仿真结果显示，在不同SNR和归一化区域大小下，所提方法在最小可达速率最大化方面显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 本文方法有效解决了FAS中的公平性问题，显著提升了弱用户性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of max-min rate maximization in
fluid antenna relay (FAR)-assisted multi-user uplink multiple-input
single-output (MISO) wireless systems, where each user is equipped with a
single fluid antenna (FA) and the base station (BS) is equipped with multiple
FAs. Unlike most existing relevant work focusing on maximizing sum rate of the
fluid antenna system (FAS), which may cause unbearable rate loss to weak users,
we propose to maximize the minimal rate of the system to ensure fairness. The
max-min optimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the positions
of FAs with meeting the minimum distance requirements of FAs, maximum
transmitting power limit, and feasible antenna region constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose an alternating algorithm with utilizing the successive
convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of
maximizing the minimal achievable rate across different signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs) and normalized region sizes.

### [4] [Delay Bound Relaxation with Deep Learning-based Haptic Estimation for Tactile Internet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00571)
*Georgios Kokkinis,Alexandros Iosifidis,Qi Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一種基於深度學習的力反饋估計方法，通過多模態輸入和序列建模技術，放鬆觸覺互聯網的嚴格延遲要求，從而提高網絡資源效率和用戶服務數量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 觸覺遠程操作需要極低的延遲和高可靠性，而高頻率的數據傳輸帶來了資源分配的複雜性和開銷，亟需解決這一關鍵挑戰。

Method: 引入深度學習模型，結合CNN、LSTM和Transformer編碼器，利用遠端力數據和本地操作信號進行多模態輸入，實現力反饋的自回歸預測，並將誤差控制在預設範圍內。

Result: 通過大量模擬，該方法在動態和剛體交互中能將可靠服務用戶數量提升達66%。

Conclusion: 該技術顯著放鬆了延遲要求，提高了網絡資源效率和調度靈活性，為觸覺互聯網的發展提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Haptic teleoperation typically demands sub-millisecond latency and ultra-high
reliability (99.999%) in Tactile Internet. At a 1 kHz haptic signal sampling
rate, this translates into an extremely high packet transmission rate, posing
significant challenges for timely delivery and introducing substantial
complexity and overhead in radio resource allocation. To address this critical
challenge, we introduce a novel DL modelthat estimates force feedback using
multi-modal input, i.e. both force measurements from the remote side and local
operator motion signals. The DL model can capture complex temporal features of
haptic time-series with the use of CNN and LSTM layers, followed by a
transformer encoder, and autoregressively produce a highly accurate estimation
of the next force values for different teleoperation activities. By ensuring
that the estimation error is within a predefined threshold, the teleoperation
system can safely relax its strict delay requirements. This enables the
batching and transmission of multiple haptic packets within a single resource
block, improving resource efficiency and facilitating scheduling in resource
allocation. Through extensive simulations, we evaluated network performance in
terms of reliability and capacity. Results show that, for both dynamic and
rigid object interactions, the proposed method increases the number of reliably
served users by up to 66%.

### [5] [Quantize-Sample-and-Verify: LLM Acceleration via Adaptive Edge-Cloud Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00605)
*Guangyi Zhang,Yunlong Cai,Guanding Yu,Petar Popovski,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的量化采样策略（Q-S），在边缘-云推测解码中优化通信带宽限制，提升解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘-云推测解码中，通信带宽有限导致传输信息需要量化，传统方法可能影响输出分布。

Method: 提出Q-S策略和自适应机制，动态调整草稿长度和量化精度。

Result: 模拟实验显示Q-S策略显著提升了解码效率。

Conclusion: Q-S策略在边缘-云部署中有效优化了性能。

Abstract: In edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD), edge devices equipped with small
language models (SLMs) generate draft tokens that are verified by large
language models (LLMs) in the cloud. A key bottleneck in such systems is the
limited communication bandwidth between edge and cloud, which necessitates
quantization of the information transmitted about generated tokens. In this
work, we introduce a novel quantize-sample (Q-S) strategy that provably
preserves the output distribution of the cloud-based model, ensuring that the
verified tokens match the distribution of those that would have been generated
directly by the LLM. We develop a throughput model for edge-cloud SD that
explicitly accounts for communication latency. Leveraging this model, we
propose an adaptive mechanism that optimizes token throughput by dynamically
adjusting the draft length and quantization precision in response to both
semantic uncertainty and channel conditions. Simulations demonstrate that the
proposed Q-S approach significantly improves decoding efficiency in realistic
edge-cloud deployment scenarios.

### [6] [Physical Layer Group Key Generation With the Aid of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00714)
*Vahid Shahiri,Guyue Li,Hamid Behroozi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究利用可重构智能表面（RIS）为多用户终端的物理信道生成组密钥，优化方法包括SCA和SDR-GR，结果显示主动RIS在性能上显著优于被动RIS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用RIS调整反射信号以使不同用户终端的聚合信道尽可能相似，从而提取共同的组密钥。

Method: 利用RIS收集的信道状态信息设计相位偏移，采用SCA和SDR-GR等优化方法，支持被动和主动RIS。

Result: 主动RIS在NMSE、KER和KGR等指标上均优于被动RIS，KGR提升超过四倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方案在静态环境中也能实现高组密钥生成率，主动RIS在密钥生成中表现更优。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have the ability to alter the
wireless environment by making changes in the impinging signal. Motivated by
this ability, in this study, we exploit the RIS to make the aggregate
reflecting channels of different user terminals (UTs) as similar as possible to
be able to extract common group secret keys from their channels. Specifically,
the RIS will adjust its parameters to pave the way for group key generation
(GKG) based on the physical channels of the UTs. Our method exploits the
already gathered channel state information (CSI) in the RIS to beneficially
design the phase shifts and does not impose additional probing burden on the
network. Additionally, this scheme is broadcast-based and does not entail the
overheads of the pairwise-based key generation. We consider both passive RIS
(PRIS) and active RIS (ARIS) to generate the group keys. The PRIS is widely
adopted in physical layer key generation (PLKG) studies due to its use of
passive elements, whereas the ARIS demonstrates superior capability in aligning
the aggregate reflected channels among nodes in the GKG scenario, as
demonstrated in this study. We will exploit various optimization methods like
successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation with Gaussian
randomization (SDR-GR) to address the raised optimization problems. Unlike most
of the studies in the literature, our scheme can achieve a high GKG rate in
static environments as well. Finally, we will examine the performance of the
proposed method by normalized mean squared error (NMSE), key error rate (KER),
key generation rate (KGR) and key randomness metrics. Our numerical results
verify that for the equal available power budget, the ARIS significantly
outperforms PRIS in NMSE and KER, achieving more than four times higher KGR.

TL;DR: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reliable detection of surrounding objects is critical for the safe operation
of connected automated vehicles (CAVs). However, inherent limitations such as
the restricted perception range and occlusion effects compromise the
reliability of single-vehicle perception systems in complex traffic
environments. Collaborative perception has emerged as a promising approach by
fusing sensor data from surrounding CAVs with diverse viewpoints, thereby
improving environmental awareness. Although collaborative perception holds
great promise, its performance is bottlenecked by wireless communication
constraints, as unreliable and bandwidth-limited channels hinder the
transmission of sensor data necessary for real-time perception. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes SComCP, a novel task-oriented semantic
communication framework for collaborative perception. Specifically, SComCP
integrates an importance-aware feature selection network that selects and
transmits semantic features most relevant to the perception task, significantly
reducing communication overhead without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, we
design a semantic codec network based on a joint source and channel coding
(JSCC) architecture, which enables bidirectional transformation between
semantic features and noise-tolerant channel symbols, thereby ensuring stable
perception under adverse wireless conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In particular, compared to
existing approaches, SComCP can maintain superior perception performance across
various channel conditions, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
scenarios. In addition, SComCP exhibits strong generalization capability,
enabling the framework to maintain high performance across diverse channel
conditions, even when trained with a specific channel model.

### [8] [Enhancing Open RAN Digital Twin Through Power Consumption Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00928)
*Ahmed Al-Tahmeesschi,Yi Chu,Josh Shackleton,Swarna Chetty,Mostafa Rahmani,David Grace,Hamed Ahmadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究分析了5G及其后网络中O-RAN架构下不同功能分割（Split 8和Split 7.2b）的功耗表现，发现功耗随网络负载变化不明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络高功耗问题突出，O-RAN架构的开源性和灵活性为能效优化提供了机会，但功能分割的功耗特性尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过实测软件定义无线电（SDR）和商用室内外RU及其对应DU、CU在不同负载下的功耗，分析PRB利用率的影响。

Result: 功耗随网络负载的增加变化不大，表明大部分能耗与流量需求无关。

Conclusion: 研究为O-RAN架构的能效优化提供了实证依据，建议进一步探索节能策略。

Abstract: The increasing demand for high-speed, ultra-reliable and low-latency
communications in 5G and beyond networks has led to a significant increase in
power consumption, particularly within the Radio Access Network (RAN). This
growing energy demand raises operational and sustainability challenges for
mobile network operators, requiring novel solutions to enhance energy
efficiency while maintaining Quality of Service (QoS). 5G networks are evolving
towards disaggregated, programmable, and intelligent architectures, with Open
Radio Access Network (O-RAN) spearheaded by the O-RAN Alliance, enabling
greater flexibility, interoperability, and cost-effectiveness. However, this
disaggregated approach introduces new complexities, especially in terms of
power consumption across different network components, including Open Radio
Units (RUs), Open Distributed Units (DUs) and Open Central Units (CUs).
Understanding the power efficiency of different O-RAN functional splits is
crucial for optimising energy consumption and network sustainability. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive measurement study of power consumption in
RUs, DUs and CUs under varying network loads, specifically analysing the impact
of Physical resource block (PRB) utilisation in Split 8 and Split 7.2b. The
measurements were conducted on both software-defined radio (SDR)-based RUs and
commercial indoor and outdoor RU, as well as their corresponding DU and CU. By
evaluating real-world hardware deployments under different operational
conditions, this study provides empirical insights into the power efficiency of
various O-RAN configurations. The results highlight that power consumption does
not scale significantly with network load, suggesting that a large portion of
energy consumption remains constant regardless of traffic demand.

### [9] [Enhancing Vehicular Platooning with Wireless Federated Learning: A Resource-Aware Control Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00856)
*Beining Wu,Jun Huang,Qiang Duan,Liang Dong,Zhipeng Cai*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合无线联邦学习（WFL）的车队协同控制框架（RACE），通过优化信息时效性和模型漂移，提升动态环境中的车队性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态车队环境中频繁的通信变化和资源限制影响了信息交换和学习同步，亟需一种高效的控制框架。

Method: 采用两阶段资源感知控制框架，第一阶段用拉格朗日对偶分解配置资源，第二阶段通过多智能体深度强化学习选择车辆，并集成多头自注意力与LSTM捕捉时空相关性。

Result: 实验证明，相比基线方法，RACE在AI4MARS数据集上优化了45%的信息时效性，加速了学习收敛，并能更适应动态环境。

Conclusion: RACE框架有效解决了动态车队环境中的资源与学习同步问题，为未来车队控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper aims to enhance the performance of Vehicular Platooning (VP)
systems integrated with Wireless Federated Learning (WFL). In highly dynamic
environments, vehicular platoons experience frequent communication changes and
resource constraints, which significantly affect information exchange and
learning model synchronization. To address these challenges, we first formulate
WFL in VP as a joint optimization problem that simultaneously considers Age of
Information (AoI) and Federated Learning Model Drift (FLMD) to ensure timely
and accurate control. Through theoretical analysis, we examine the impact of
FLMD on convergence performance and develop a two-stage Resource-Aware Control
framework (RACE). The first stage employs a Lagrangian dual decomposition
method for resource configuration, while the second stage implements a
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach for vehicle selection. The
approach integrates Multi-Head Self-Attention and Long Short-Term Memory
networks to capture spatiotemporal correlations in communication states.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, the
proposed framework improves AoI optimization by up to 45%, accelerates learning
convergence, and adapts more effectively to dynamic VP environments on the
AI4MARS dataset.

*Varsha Pendyala,Pedro Morgado,William Sethares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LiSER的知识蒸馏框架，利用未标记的视听数据进行语音情感识别(SER)，减少了依赖大规模标记数据的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类通过多模态视听线索传递情感，因此开发基于这两种模态的SER系统是有益的，但收集大量标记数据成本高昂。

Method: 提出了LiSER框架，利用大型教师模型从先进语音和面部表征模型中提取知识，并将其传输到轻量级学生模型中。

Result: 在RAVDESS和CREMA-D两个基准数据集上的实验表明，LiSER能够有效减少对标记数据集的依赖。

Conclusion: LiSER通过知识蒸馏技术，为SER任务提供了一种高效且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Voice interfaces integral to the human-computer interaction systems can
benefit from speech emotion recognition (SER) to customize responses based on
user emotions. Since humans convey emotions through multi-modal audio-visual
cues, developing SER systems using both the modalities is beneficial. However,
collecting a vast amount of labeled data for their development is expensive.
This paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework called LightweightSER
(LiSER) that leverages unlabeled audio-visual data for SER, using large teacher
models built on advanced speech and face representation models. LiSER transfers
knowledge regarding speech emotions and facial expressions from the teacher
models to lightweight student models. Experiments conducted on two benchmark
datasets, RAVDESS and CREMA-D, demonstrate that LiSER can reduce the dependence
on extensive labeled datasets for SER tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过自蒸馏减少传统蒸馏方法的计算成本，提高多任务学习的效率和准确性。

Method: 使用统一的CNN架构MTL-net，并利用模型的历史平滑版本作为教师模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于其他方法，训练稳定性高且过拟合减少。

Conclusion: Smooth-Distill为多任务学习提供了高效平衡准确性和训练效率的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework
designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor
placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes
a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data
and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional
distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the
proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself
as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while
maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a
comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures
across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public
datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill
consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition
and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced
stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced
overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This
framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation
in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for
multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training
efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training,
which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on
resource-constrained platforms. The code and model are available at

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统质量控制方法缺乏灵活性，而数据驱动方法（如机器学习）虽性能高但缺乏可解释性。为解决这一问题，论文提出了一种透明且数据驱动的故障检测方法。

Method: 方法结合了监督学习的多类故障分类、SHAP事后解释和领域特定的可视化技术，并通过定量扰动分析和定性专家评估验证解释的有效性。

Result: 在安全关键的压接工艺数据集上，系统达到95.9%的故障检测准确率，定量和定性分析均证实了解释的相关性和可理解性。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了数据驱动故障检测的可信度和可解释性，适用于工业质量控制领域。

Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial,
particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control
approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack
adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and
necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such
as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically
function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial
environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a
methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and
transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for
multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc
interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps
model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study
proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through
quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative
expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a
safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time
series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both
quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed
the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This
human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in
data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in
industrial quality control.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于时间图神经网络（TGNN）的方法，结合道路网络数据来提升GNSS在密集城市环境中的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS在密集城市环境中常因多径和非视距误差导致精度下降，现有方法缺乏灵活性和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过训练TGNN预测正确的道路段及其不确定性，并将其用于卡尔曼滤波器的测量更新步骤。

Result: 在实际GNSS数据和开源道路网络上验证，定位误差减少了29%。

Conclusion: 这是首个结合道路网络数据和GNSS测量的深度学习方法，显著提升了定位精度。

Abstract: The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides critical positioning
information globally, but its accuracy in dense urban environments is often
compromised by multipath and non-line-of-sight errors. Road network data can be
used to reduce the impact of these errors and enhance the accuracy of a
positioning system. Previous works employing road network data are either
limited to offline applications, or rely on Kalman Filter (KF) heuristics with
little flexibility and robustness. We instead propose training a Temporal Graph
Neural Network (TGNN) to integrate road network information into a KF. The TGNN
is designed to predict the correct road segment and its associated uncertainty
to be used in the measurement update step of the KF. We validate our approach
with real-world GNSS data and open-source road networks, observing a 29%
decrease in positioning error for challenging scenarios compared to a GNSS-only
KF. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning-based
approach jointly employing road network data and GNSS measurements to determine
the user position on Earth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临隐私风险（未受保护的模型更新传输）和量化异构性导致的学习效用下降问题。目前的研究通常只解决其中一个问题，本文旨在同时解决这两大挑战。

Method: 提出一种新型随机量化器（SQ），确保差分隐私并最小化量化误差；引入集群大小优化技术和线性融合方法，提升模型聚合准确性。

Result: 数值模拟显示，相较于传统LaplaceSQ-FL算法，所提方法在隐私保护和学习效用方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 本文方法有效提升了联邦学习的隐私保护和模型效用，为多量化分辨率设备的协同训练提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed
machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across
multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its
advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from
the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC)
and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model
quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically
addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility
under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task.
In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a
privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different
quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we
introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously
achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the
proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To
address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization
technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation
accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms
of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional
LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.

satellite constellations. However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity
for multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and
frequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite
movement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within
single-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the
vast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in
suboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article
proposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire
multi-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically
forms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The
formation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide
tailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative
strategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial
intelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite
access and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS
significantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover
overhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D
connectivity in multi-constellation environments.

using a lifting scheme that relaxes both the orthogonality and equal filter
length constraints, providing greater flexibility in filter design. The
proposed unit enhances convolution, pooling, and downsampling operations,
leading to improved image classification and anomaly detection in convolutional
neural networks (CNN). When integrated into an 18-layer residual neural network
(ResNet-18), the approach improved classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 2.12%
and on the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) by 9.73%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing fine-grained details. Similar improvements were
observed in ResNet-34. For anomaly detection in the hazelnut category of the
MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset, the proposed method achieved competitive and
wellbalanced performance in both segmentation and detection tasks,
outperforming existing approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于电磁信息理论的自监督预训练框架（EIT-SPT），旨在将电磁物理知识注入无线基础模型（WFMs），以解决现有大型AI模型在6G网络应用中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络对全息通信、普适感知和原生智能的需求推动了AI原生无线网络的发展，但现有大型AI模型在电磁（EM）物理一致性和数据集可获取性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了EIT-SPT框架，通过自监督预训练将EM物理知识系统地嵌入WFMs，以提高其物理一致性、泛化能力和数据效率。

Result: 通过案例研究验证了EIT-SPT框架的有效性，并展示了WFMs在6G场景中的多样化应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究为WFMs的未来发展提出了关键挑战和研究方向，为6G网络的AI原生设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: While initial applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in wireless
communications over the past decade have demonstrated considerable potential
using specialized models for targeted communication tasks, the revolutionary
demands of sixth-generation (6G) networks for holographic communications,
ubiquitous sensing, and native intelligence are propelling a necessary
evolution towards AI-native wireless networks. The arrival of large AI models
paves the way for the next phase of Wireless AI, driven by wireless foundation
models (WFMs). In particular, pre-training on universal electromagnetic (EM)
principles equips WFMs with the essential adaptability for a multitude of
demanding 6G applications. However, existing large AI models face critical
limitations, including pre-training strategies disconnected from EM-compliant
constraints leading to physically inconsistent predictions, a lack of embedded
understanding of wave propagation physics, and the inaccessibility of massive
labeled datasets for comprehensive EM-aware training. To address these
challenges, this article presents an electromagnetic information theory-guided
self-supervised pre-training (EIT-SPT) framework designed to systematically
inject EM physics into WFMs. The EIT-SPT framework aims to infuse WFMs with
intrinsic EM knowledge, thereby enhancing their physical consistency,
generalization capabilities across varied EM landscapes, and overall data
efficiency. Building upon the proposed EIT-SPT framework, this article first
elaborates on diverse potential applications in 6G scenarios of WFMs, then
validates the efficacy of the proposed framework through illustrative case
studies, and finally summarizes critical open research challenges and future
directions for WFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中的数据隐私和窃听问题，通过RIS辅助和部分设备充当干扰信号发送者来提高安全性和效率。

Method: 采用RIS辅助框架，联合优化参与选择、带宽分配和RIS设计，使用TD3算法解决混合整数非线性规划问题。

Result: 仿真显示，该方案比基准方法减少了约27%的训练延迟。

Conclusion: 提出的RIS辅助联邦学习框架在保证收敛精度和安全上传需求的同时，显著降低了训练延迟。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective approach for training
neural network models without requiring the sharing of participants' raw data,
thereby addressing data privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted FL framework in the presence
of eavesdropping, where partial edge devices are selected to participate in the
FL training process. In contrast, the remaining devices serve as cooperative
jammers by transmitting jamming signals to disrupt eavesdropping. We aim to
minimize the training latency in each FL round by jointly optimizing
participant selection, bandwidth allocation, and RIS beamforming design,
subject to the convergence accuracy of FL and the secure uploading
requirements. To solve the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming
problem, we propose a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3)
algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the
FL training latency by approximately 27$\%$ compared to baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究通过光学手段非侵入性监测颈动脉和颈内静脉的血流动力学，测试了七种生理操作对血流的影响，扩展了血流调节的范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去的研究主要在健康志愿者和受控环境下进行，为了推动技术更接近临床应用，需要在病理和现实环境（如ICU）中测试。

Method: 使用临床PPG和自制PPG传感器收集两名健康志愿者在不同生理操作（如Valsalva和IJV闭塞）下的数据，并与ECG信号对比。

Result: 新提出的生理操作（Valsalva和IJV闭塞）对血流的调节效果比传统方法更显著。

Conclusion: 这些生理操作在调节颈部主要血管血流方面具有较高潜力。

Abstract: Large neck vessels (carotid artery and internal jugular vein, IJV) offer a
unique opportunity to monitor hemodynamics non-invasively by optical means. The
primary shortcoming of past work has been the focus on healthy volunteers in
normal physiological conditions and well-controlled environments. To drive the
technology closer to the bedside, testing is required under more re-alistic
conditions, including in pathologies and real-world environments (e.g., similar
toICU or emergency care settings). The primary goal of the current work was to
extend the range of physiological maneuvers for blood flow modulation by
introducing new maneuvers and ob-serving PPG response to them. The data from
the necks of two healthy volunteers in a supine position were collected by
clinical PPG and in-house built PPG sensors, accompanied by ECG signal
collection. Seven maneuvers (abdominojugular test, breath holding, Valsalva,
proximal occlusion of right IJV, distal occlusion of right IJV, proximal
occlusion of left IJV, distal occlusion of left IJV) were performed in sequence
with 1 min allocated for each maneuver. The 1 min was split into three
segments: baseline (15 s), experiment (15 s), and recovery (30 s). Thus, the
overall du-ration of the experiment was 7 min. AC amplitude from clinical PPG,
DC amplitudes from in-house built PPG, and ECG signal were compared during all
seven physiological maneuvers. Newly proposed maneuvers (Valsalva and IJV
occlusions) demonstrated modulation of blood flow, which was more significant
than previously reported maneuvers (abdominojugular test and breath holding).
The proposed physiological maneuvers demonstrate high potential as instruments
for modulating blood flow in major neck vessels.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了现有音乐源分离（MSS）模型在双耳音频上的性能表现，发现这些模型在保留空间信息方面表现不佳，并对未来研究提出了展望。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着虚拟现实和增强现实的普及，以及双耳音频在无障碍应用中的潜力，研究双耳音频在音乐信息检索中的应用变得重要。

Method: 论文通过合成双耳音频数据集（基于MUSDB18-HQ和开源头部相关传输函数），评估了多个MSS模型在保留空间信息方面的表现，并使用信号处理和耳间线索指标进行量化分析。

Result: 结果显示，现有的立体声音乐源分离模型无法有效保留双耳音频的空间信息，且性能退化与模型架构和目标乐器有关。

Conclusion: 研究强调了音乐源分离与沉浸式音频交叉领域的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Binaural audio remains underexplored within the music information retrieval
community. Motivated by the rising popularity of virtual and augmented reality
experiences as well as potential applications to accessibility, we investigate
how well existing music source separation (MSS) models perform on binaural
audio. Although these models process two-channel inputs, it is unclear how
effectively they retain spatial information. In this work, we evaluate how
several popular MSS models preserve spatial information on both standard stereo
and novel binaural datasets. Our binaural data is synthesized using stems from
MUSDB18-HQ and open-source head-related transfer functions by positioning
instrument sources randomly along the horizontal plane. We then assess the
spatial quality of the separated stems using signal processing and interaural
cue-based metrics. Our results show that stereo MSS models fail to preserve the
spatial information critical for maintaining the immersive quality of binaural
audio, and that the degradation depends on model architecture as well as the
target instrument. Finally, we highlight valuable opportunities for future work
at the intersection of MSS and immersive audio.

### [21] [AI-Hybrid TRNG: Kernel-Based Deep Learning for Near-Uniform Entropy Harvesting from Physical Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00145)
*Hasan Yiğit*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AI-Hybrid TRNG是一种深度学习框架，直接从物理噪声中提取近乎均匀的熵，无需量子设备或昂贵的射频接收器，适用于资源受限的平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统随机数生成器需要昂贵硬件的问题，提供低成本、高效的随机数生成方案。

Method: 结合低成本的射频前端和CPU时序抖动进行训练，动态内外网络适配自然源和重新播种，生成真正不可预测的序列。

Result: 生成的随机数通过NIST SP 800-22测试和19种定制统计测试，满足密码学标准，无预测偏见，模型体积小（<0.5MB）。

Conclusion: AI-Hybrid TRNG扩展了高完整性随机数生成器的应用范围，适用于安全系统、加密协议和资源受限设备。

Abstract: AI-Hybrid TRNG is a deep-learning framework that extracts near-uniform
entropy directly from physical noise, eliminating the need for bulky quantum
devices or expensive laboratory-grade RF receivers. Instead, it relies on a
low-cost, thumb-sized RF front end, plus CPU-timing jitter, for training, and
then emits 32-bit high-entropy streams without any quantization step.
  Unlike deterministic or trained artificial intelligence random number
generators (RNGs), our dynamic inner-outer network couples adaptive natural
sources and reseeding, yielding truly unpredictable and autonomous sequences.
Generated numbers pass the NIST SP 800-22 battery better than a CPU-based
method. It also passes nineteen bespoke statistical tests for both bit- and
integer-level analysis. All results satisfy cryptographic standards, while
forward and backward prediction experiments reveal no exploitable biases. The
model's footprint is below 0.5 MB, making it deployable on MCUs and FPGA soft
cores, as well as suitable for other resource-constrained platforms.
  By detaching randomness quality from dedicated hardware, AI-Hybrid TRNG
broadens the reach of high-integrity random number generators across secure
systems, cryptographic protocols, embedded and edge devices, stochastic
simulations, and server applications that need randomness.

Motivation: 提高视网膜前膜手术分类的准确性和可靠性，以辅助临床决策。

Method: 基于ResNet18 CNN，结合术后OCT扫描，采用预处理和可调小波单元（OrthLatt-UwU和PR-Relax-UwU）。

Result: 预处理数据准确率72%，可调小波单元分别提升至76%和78%，优于人类评分者。

Conclusion: CNN结合可调小波单元显著提升分类性能，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we developed deep learning-based method to classify the type
of surgery performed for epiretinal membrane (ERM) removal, either internal
limiting membrane (ILM) removal or ERM-alone removal. Our model, based on the
ResNet18 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, utilizes
postoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) center scans as inputs. We
evaluated the model using both original scans and scans preprocessed with
energy crop and wavelet denoising, achieving 72% accuracy on preprocessed
inputs, outperforming the 66% accuracy achieved on original scans. To further
improve accuracy, we integrated tunable wavelet units with two key adaptations:
Orthogonal Lattice-based Wavelet Units (OrthLatt-UwU) and Perfect
Reconstruction Relaxation-based Wavelet Units (PR-Relax-UwU). These units
allowed the model to automatically adjust filter coefficients during training
and were incorporated into downsampling, stride-two convolution, and pooling
layers, enhancing its ability to distinguish between ERM-ILM removal and
ERM-alone removal, with OrthLattUwU boosting accuracy to 76% and PR-Relax-UwU
increasing performance to 78%. Performance comparisons showed that our AI model
outperformed a trained human grader, who achieved only 50% accuracy in
classifying the removal surgery types from postoperative OCT scans. These
findings highlight the potential of CNN based models to improve clinical
decision-making by providing more accurate and reliable classifications. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ tunable wavelets for
classifying different types of ERM removal surgery.
