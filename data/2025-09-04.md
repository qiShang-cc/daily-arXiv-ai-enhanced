### [1] [EEG-MSAF: An Interpretable Microstate Framework uncovers Default-Mode Decoherence in Early Neurodegeneration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02568)
*Mohammad Mehedi Hasan,Pedro G. Lind,Hernando Ombao,Anis Yazidi,Rabindra Khadka*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: EEG-MSAF是一种端到端的EEG微状态分析框架，用于早期诊断痴呆症，表现出高性能和泛化能力，准确率达89%至95%，并识别出关键的生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症的早期诊断是重要的全球健康挑战，传统EEG方法难以捕捉其瞬态复杂性，因此需要一种更准确、可解释的方法。

Method: EEG-MSAF分为三个阶段：自动微状态特征提取、机器学习分类和SHAP特征排序，用于区分痴呆症、轻度认知障碍和正常认知。

Result: 在CAUEEG和Thessaloniki数据集上分别达到89%和95%的准确率，优于基线方法，并识别出微状态C和F作为关键生物标志物。

Conclusion: EEG-MSAF通过结合准确性、泛化能力和可解释性，推动了EEG在痴呆症诊断中的应用，并为认知谱系的脑动态提供了新见解。

Abstract: Dementia (DEM) is a growing global health challenge, underscoring the need
for early and accurate diagnosis. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a
non-invasive window into brain activity, but conventional methods struggle to
capture its transient complexity. We present the \textbf{EEG Microstate
Analysis Framework (EEG-MSAF)}, an end-to-end pipeline that leverages EEG
microstates discrete, quasi-stable topographies to identify DEM-related
biomarkers and distinguish DEM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal
cognition (NC). EEG-MSAF comprises three stages: (1) automated microstate
feature extraction, (2) classification with machine learning (ML), and (3)
feature ranking using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to highlight key
biomarkers. We evaluate on two EEG datasets: the public Chung-Ang University
EEG (CAUEEG) dataset and a clinical cohort from Thessaloniki Hospital. Our
framework demonstrates strong performance and generalizability. On CAUEEG,
EEG-MSAF-SVM achieves \textbf{89\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, surpassing the deep
learning baseline CEEDNET by \textbf{19.3\%}. On the Thessaloniki dataset, it
reaches \textbf{95\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, comparable to EEGConvNeXt. SHAP
analysis identifies mean correlation and occurrence as the most informative
metrics: disruption of microstate C (salience/attention network) dominates DEM
prediction, while microstate F, a novel default-mode pattern, emerges as a key
early biomarker for both MCI and DEM. By combining accuracy, generalizability,
and interpretability, EEG-MSAF advances EEG-based dementia diagnosis and sheds
light on brain dynamics across the cognitive spectrum.

### [3] [minPIC: Towards Optimal Power Allocation in Multi-User Interference Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02797)
*Sagnik Bhattacharya,Abhiram Rao Gorle,John M. Cioffi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为minPIC的新框架，用于优化多用户干扰信道中的功率、子载波和解码顺序分配，避免了传统方法的启发式假设，实现了全局最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中需解决分布式资源分配问题，当前方法因固定启发式规则导致性能不佳，亟需新方案。

Method: minPIC采用双变量引导的排序标准和凸优化技术，结合辅助对数行列式约束，高效解决资源分配问题。

Result: minPIC首次实现了高斯干扰信道中SIC可达速率区域的帕累托边界，有望满足6G应用的高速率、低功耗需求。

Conclusion: minPIC为无小区网络的干扰管理提供了可扩展的解决方案，具有重要应用前景。

Abstract: 6G envisions massive cell-free networks with spatially nested multiple access
(MAC) and broadcast (BC) channels without centralized coordination. This makes
optimal resource allocation across power, subcarriers, and decoding orders
crucial for interference channels (ICs), where neither transmitters nor
receivers can cooperate. Current orthogonal multiple access (OMA) methods, as
well as non-orthogonal (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RSMA) schemes, rely on fixed
heuristics for interference management, leading to suboptimal rates, power
inefficiency, and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel minPIC
framework for optimal power, subcarrier, and decoding order allocation in
general multi-user ICs. Unlike existing methods, minPIC eliminates heuristic
SIC order assumptions. Despite the convexity of the IC capacity region, fixing
an SIC order induces non-convexity in resource allocation, traditionally
requiring heuristic approximations. We instead introduce a dual-variable-guided
sorting criterion to identify globally optimal SIC orders, followed by convex
optimization with auxiliary log-det constraints, efficiently solved via binary
search. We also demonstrate that minPIC could potentially meet the stringent
high-rate, low-power targets of immersive XR and other 6G applications. To the
best of our knowledge, minPIC is the first algorithmic realisation of the
Pareto boundary of the SIC-achievable rate region for Gaussian ICs, opening the
door to scalable interference management in cell-free networks.

### [4] [Protecting Legacy Wireless Systems Against Interference: Precoding and Codebook Approaches Using Massive MIMO and Region Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02819)
*Sameer Mathad,Taejoon Kim,David J. Love*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通信理论方法，通过在MIMO系统设计中加入接收功率约束（区域约束），以减少新频段对传统无线系统的干扰，同时分析了单用户和多用户系统的容量和总和速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高速无线通信需求的增长，新频段的使用可能干扰传统无线系统，而这些传统系统多是关键基础设施网络的基础，因此迫切需要开发保护传统用户的方案。

Method: 论文采用了基于通信理论的解决方案，利用地理约束区域的知识，在MIMO系统设计中加入区域约束（接收功率限制），并进行了容量分析和总和速率分析。

Result: 提出了一种预编码设计方法，可以在利用新频段的同时有效保护传统用户，减少干扰影响。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种比传统地理排除区域更优的解决方案，实现了新频段的利用与传统用户保护的双赢。

Abstract: The ever-increasing demand for high-speed wireless communication has
generated significant interest in utilizing frequency bands that are adjacent
to those occupied by legacy wireless systems. Since the legacy wireless systems
were designed based on often decades-old assumptions about wireless
interference, utilizing these new bands will result in interference with the
existing legacy users. Many of these legacy wireless devices are used by
critical infrastructure networks upon which society depends. There is an urgent
need to develop schemes that can protect legacy users from such interference.
For many applications, legacy users are located within
geographically-constrained regions. Several studies have proposed mitigating
interference through the implementation of exclusion zones near these
geographically-constrained regions. In contrast to solutions based on
geographic exclusion zones, this paper presents a communication theory-based
solution. By leveraging knowledge of these geographically-constrained regions,
we aim to reduce the interference impact on legacy users. We achieve this by
incorporating received power constraints, termed as region constraints, in our
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system design. We perform a
capacity analysis of single-user massive MIMO and a sum-rate analysis of the
multi-user massive MIMO system with transmit power and region constraints. We
present a precoding design method that allows for the utilization of new
frequency bands while protecting legacy users.

### [5] [Spatially Adaptive SWIPT with Pinching Antenna under Probabilistic LoS Blockage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03038)
*Ruihong Jiang,Ruichen Zhang,Yanqing Xu,Huimin Hu,Yang Lu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于功率分割的可重构夹持天线联合优化方法，以最大化用户平均信噪比，同时满足能量收集和天线放置限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是在概率视线阻塞环境下，优化无线信息和能量传输系统的性能，确保能量收集的可行性。

Method: 通过联合优化天线位置和功率分割比例，推导出闭式最优解。

Result: 结果表明，能量收集需求对天线最优位置及其可行区域有决定性影响，需将天线尽量靠近用户以最大化信道增益。

Conclusion: 空间适应性与动态功率分割结合，能在概率视线阻塞下实现稳健的无线信息和能量传输性能。

Abstract: This paper considers a power-splitting (PS)-based simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) system employing a reconfigurable
pinching antenna (PA) under probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) blockage. We
formulate a joint optimization of the PA position and the PS ratio to maximize
the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at a user, subject to its average
energy harvesting (EH) and PA placement limits. We derive a closed-form optimal
solution. Results demonstrate that the EH requirement has a deterministic
impact on the optimal PA position as well as its feasible region, requiring
deployment of the PA as close to the user as possible to maximize average
channel gain. This spatial adaptation, combined with dynamic PS, enables robust
SWIPT performance in the presence of probabilistic LoS blockage, revealing that
mechanical reconfigurability primarily enhances sustainability by ensuring
energy feasibility in dynamic environments.

### [6] [S2M2ECG: Spatio-temporal bi-directional State Space Model Enabled Multi-branch Mamba for ECG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03066)
*Huaicheng Zhang,Ruoxin Wang,Chenlian Zhou,Jiguang Shi,Yue Ge,Zhoutong Li,Sheng Chang,Hao Wang,Jin He,Qijun Huang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: S2M2ECG是一种基于状态空间模型（SSM）的深度学习架构，通过三级融合机制和多分支设计，实现了高效的心电图（ECG）信号分析与心血管疾病诊断，平衡了性能、计算复杂性和ECG特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多导联ECG信号在深度学习领域中性能、计算复杂性和多源特征融合的平衡问题。

Method: 采用三级融合机制：时空双向SSM、导联内时间信息融合和导联间特征交互模块，并引入多分支设计和导联融合模块。

Result: 在三类场景（节律、形态、临床）中表现优异，参数极少，适合高效推理与部署。

Conclusion: S2M2ECG为心血管疾病诊断提供了一种高性能、轻量化的解决方案。

Abstract: As one of the most effective methods for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
diagnosis, multi-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals present a characteristic
multi-sensor information fusion challenge that has been continuously researched
in deep learning domains. Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with
different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance,
computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains
challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent
design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them
particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes
S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1)
Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level
signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional
scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward
directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information
fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in
ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated,
enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration
with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior
performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover,
its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among
existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and
convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative
that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity,
and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance,
lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，YOLOv11的mAP分别达到99.4%（CWRU）、97.8%（PU）和99.5%（IMS）。

Conclusion: CWT-YOLO方法不仅能高精度分类故障，还能可视化故障位置，为旋转机械监测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This letter proposes a YOLO-based framework for spatial bearing fault
diagnosis using time-frequency spectrograms derived from continuous wavelet
transform (CWT). One-dimensional vibration signals are first transformed into
time-frequency spectrograms using Morlet wavelets to capture transient fault
signatures. These spectrograms are then processed by YOLOv9, v10, and v11
models to classify fault types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets,
including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU),
and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), the proposed CWT--YOLO pipeline
achieves significantly higher accuracy and generalizability than the baseline
MCNN--LSTM model. Notably, YOLOv11 reaches mAP scores of 99.4% (CWRU), 97.8%
(PU), and 99.5% (IMS). In addition, its region-aware detection mechanism
enables direct visualization of fault locations in spectrograms, offering a
practical solution for condition monitoring in rotating machinery.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自监督学习（SSL）的无线电信号表示学习方法，通过对比学习从大量无标签数据中提取稳健且可迁移的表示，并在多个无线通信任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发AI驱动的6G解决方案需要大量数据标注，自监督学习可通过利用无标签数据减少对标注数据的依赖，提高模型泛化能力。

Method: 采用动量对比的对比学习方法，结合精心设计的数据增强和多样化数据，提取稳健的信号表示。

Result: 学习到的表示在AoA估计和AMC任务中表现优异，甚至优于有监督基线，且通过微调进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 自监督学习有望改变无线通信领域AI应用的现状，为6G AI模型的规模化应用提供可能。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to play a pivotal role in 6G.
However, a key challenge in developing AI-powered solutions is the extensive
data collection and labeling efforts required to train supervised deep learning
models. To overcome this, self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have
recently demonstrated remarkable success across various domains by leveraging
large volumes of unlabeled data to achieve near-supervised performance. In this
paper, we propose an effective SSL scheme for radio signal representation
learning using momentum contrast. By applying contrastive learning, our method
extracts robust, transferable representations from a large real-world dataset.
We assess the generalizability of these learned representations across two
wireless communications tasks: angle of arrival (AoA) estimation and automatic
modulation classification (AMC). Our results show that carefully designed
augmentations and diverse data enable contrastive learning to produce
high-quality, invariant latent representations. These representations are
effective even with frozen encoder weights, and fine-tuning further enhances
performance, surpassing supervised baselines. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to propose and demonstrate the effectiveness of
self-supervised learning for radio signals across multiple tasks. Our findings
highlight the potential of self-supervised learning to transform AI for
wireless communications by reducing dependence on labeled data and improving
model generalization - paving the way for scalable foundational 6G AI models
and solutions.

### [9] [Handwriting Imagery EEG Classification based on Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03111)
*Hao Yang,Guang Ouyang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究探索了利用深度神经网络解码与非侵入性脑电图（EEG）相关的书写想象的英文字母的极限，初步验证了EEG到文本翻译的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是探索非侵入性EEG在书写想象任务中解码英文字母的潜力，为脑机接口（BCI）提供更实用的方法。

Method: 通过记录五名参与者想象书写26个字母时的头皮EEG，分析字母特异性模式，并用四个卷积神经网络（CNN）模型进行分类。

Result: 数据显示字母特异性模式的EEG信号，CNN分类器的准确率最高达20%（机会水平为3.85%），初步验证了可行性。

Conclusion: 虽然准确率不足以实际应用，但研究表明非侵入性EEG在文本翻译中具有潜力，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Handwriting imagery has emerged as a promising paradigm for brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) aimed at translating brain activity into text output.
Compared with invasively recorded electroencephalography (EEG), non-invasive
recording offers a more practical and feasible approach to capturing brain
signals for BCI. This study explores the limit of decoding non-invasive EEG
associated with handwriting imagery into English letters using deep neural
networks. To this end, five participants were instructed to imagine writing the
26 English letters with their EEG being recorded from the scalp. A measurement
of EEG similarity across letters was conducted to investigate letter-specific
patterns in the dataset. Subsequently, four convolutional neural network (CNN)
models were trained for EEG classification. Descriptively, the EEG data clearly
exhibited letter-specific patterns serving as a proof-of-concept for
EEG-to-text translation. Under the chance level of accuracy at 3.85%, the CNN
classifiers trained on each participant reached the highest limit of around
20%. This study marks the first attempt to decode non-invasive EEG associated
with handwriting imagery. Although the achieved accuracy is not sufficient for
a usable brain-to-text BCI, the model's performance is noteworthy in revealing
the potential for translating non-invasively recorded brain signals into text
outputs and establishing a baseline for future research.

*Maximilian Neidhardt,Sarah Latus,Tim Eixmann,Gereon Hüttmann,Alexander Schlaefer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种微型化光纤扫描内窥镜和基于深度学习的信号处理流程，用于快速、局部弹性成像，显著提高了弹性估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图像方法在微创手术中不适用，需要一种实时的局部弹性成像技术。

Result: 新方法在2D和3D扫描中显著降低了误差，并在离体猪组织中验证了可行性。

Conclusion: 该技术为实时弹性成像提供了一种有效的解决方案，适用于临床干预。

Abstract: Tissue stiffness is related to soft tissue pathologies and can be assessed
through palpation or via clinical imaging systems, e.g., ultrasound or magnetic
resonance imaging. Typically, the image based approaches are not suitable
during interventions, particularly for minimally invasive surgery. To this end,
we present a miniaturized fiber scanning endoscope for fast and localized
elastography. Moreover, we propose a deep learning based signal processing
pipeline to account for the intricate data and the need for real-time
estimates. Our elasticity estimation approach is based on imaging complex and
diffuse wave fields that encompass multiple wave frequencies and propagate in
various directions. We optimize the probe design to enable different scan
patterns. To maximize temporal sampling while maintaining three-dimensional
information we define a scan pattern in a conical shape with a temporal
frequency of 5.05 kHz. To efficiently process the image sequences of complex
wave fields we consider a spatio-temporal deep learning network. We train the
network in an end-to-end fashion on measurements from phantoms representing
multiple elasticities. The network is used to obtain localized and robust
elasticity estimates, allowing to create elasticity maps in real-time. For 2D
scanning, our approach results in a mean absolute error of 6.31+-5.76 kPa
compared to 11.33+-12.78 kPa for conventional phase tracking. For scanning
without estimating the wave direction, the novel 3D method reduces the error to
4.48+-3.63 kPa compared to 19.75+-21.82 kPa for the conventional 2D method.
Finally, we demonstrate feasibility of elasticity estimates in ex-vivo porcine
tissue.

Motivation: 解决传统固定位置天线系统在串扰下的局限性，提升ISAC系统的整体性能。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）中的TD3算法，联合设计波束成形和天线位置，以最小化CRB。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的抗串扰（CR）算法优于其他基准方案。

Conclusion: 该算法显著提升了ISAC系统的性能，展示了DRL在复杂优化问题中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates a movable antenna (MA) enabled integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system under the influence of antenna crosstalk. First, it
generalizes the antenna crosstalk model from the conventional fixed-position
antenna (FPA) system to the MA scenario. Then, a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)
minimization problem driven by joint beamforming and antenna position design is
presented. Specifically, to address this highly non-convex flexible beamforming
problem, we deploy a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to train a
flexible beamforming agent. To ensure stability during training, a Twin Delayed
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm is adopted to balance
exploration with reward maximization for efficient and reliable learning.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed crosstalk-resilient (CR)
algorithm enhances the overall ISAC performance compared to other benchmark
schemes.

Motivation: 状态估计器的自我评估不确定性指标（如协方差矩阵）的可靠性对下游任务至关重要，但这些指标可能因噪声或模型不匹配而误导。

Method: 构建一个紧凑的可信度组合，结合传统指标和评分规则（如NLL、ES），并提出基于能量距离的位置测试和新方法区分问题类型。

Result: 蒙特卡洛模拟显示，该方法在六种不同场景下分类准确率达80-100%，显著优于单一指标基线。

Conclusion: 该框架将可信度指标转化为可操作的模型缺陷诊断工具，优于传统方法。

Abstract: State estimators often provide self-assessed uncertainty metrics, such as
covariance matrices, whose reliability is critical for downstream tasks.
However, these self-assessments can be misleading due to underlying modeling
violations like noise or system model mismatch. This letter addresses the
problem of estimator credibility by introducing a unified, multi-metric
evaluation framework. We construct a compact credibility portfolio that
synergistically combines traditional metrics like the Normalized Estimation
Error Squared (NEES) and the Noncredibility Index (NCI) with proper scoring
rules, namely the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and the Energy Score (ES). Our
key contributions are a novel energy distance-based location test to robustly
detect system model misspecification and a method that leverages the asymmetric
sensitivities of NLL and ES to distinguish optimism covariance scaling from
system bias. Monte Carlo simulations across six distinct credibility scenarios
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high classification accuracy
(80-100%), drastically outperforming single-metric baselines which consistently
fail to provide a complete and correct diagnosis. This framework provides a
practical tool for turning patterns of credibility indicators into actionable
diagnoses of model deficiencies.

Conclusion: 论文通过理论分析和优化方法，成功解决了混合噪声环境下的传输星座优化问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Mixed noise, composed of white Gaussian noise (WGN) and impulsive noise (IN),
appears in numerous communication scenarios and can severely degrade system
performance. In this paper, we address this issue by optimizing the transmitted
constellation under mixed noise based on a theoretical analysis of the cutoff
rate (CR). First, starting from the passband model of the mixed noise, we
derive its corresponding baseband representation. Due to the complexity of the
CR, an exact analytic expression is generally intractable. Therefore, the
baseband noise model is employed to obtain closed-form lower and upper bounds
of the CR. A piecewise linear approximation is applied to derive efficient
bounds by exploiting the algebraic properties of the integral terms. These
bounds are then used as criteria to optimize the transmitted constellation
points in both geometric and probabilistic distributions. The projected
gradient method is employed to solve the optimization problem, and the
convergence and properties of the solutions are analyzed. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed CR bounds are tight and exhibit the expected
asymptotic behavior. Furthermore, the optimized constellation scheme achieves a
significant rate improvement compared to baselines.

Abstract: Hybrid Analog and Digital (HAD) architectures provide a cost-effective
alternative for large-scale antenna arrays, but accurate Direction-of-Arrival

signal, we introduce a second-order statistics estimation algorithm that
achieves near-optimal accuracy, approaching the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB)
and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in simulation.

Result: 学习的策略与专家策略性能相当，训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 通用强化学习算法是解决四足机器人运动控制的有效方案。

Abstract: Climbing, crouching, bridging gaps, and walking up stairs are just a few of
the advantages that quadruped robots have over wheeled robots, making them more
suitable for navigating rough and unstructured terrain. However, executing such
manoeuvres requires precise temporal coordination and complex agent-environment
interactions. Moreover, legged locomotion is inherently more prone to slippage
and tripping, and the classical approach of modeling such cases to design a
robust controller thus quickly becomes impractical. In contrast, reinforcement
learning offers a compelling solution by enabling optimal control through trial
and error. We present a generalist reinforcement learning algorithm for
quadrupedal agents in dynamic motion scenarios. The learned policy rivals
state-of-the-art specialist policies trained using a mixture of experts
approach, while using only 25% as many agents during training. Our experiments
also highlight the key components of the generalist locomotion policy and the
primary factors contributing to its success.

Motivation: 探究情感对齐是否作为共情沟通的前提，在HRI中影响机器人的说服力、用户沟通风格及机器人被感知的心理状态和共情能力。

Method: 使用NAO机器人，在42名参与者中比较中性沟通与情感对齐沟通两种条件，分析其对说服力、沟通风格及心理状态归属的影响。

Result: 情感对齐对用户沟通风格和说服力无影响，但显著增加了机器人被赋予的心理状态和共情感知。

Conclusion: 情感对齐在HRI中虽未能提升说服力或改变沟通风格，但能有效增强对机器人心理状态和共情的感知。

Abstract: The paper presents an experiment on the effects of adaptive emotional
alignment between agents, considered a prerequisite for empathic communication,
in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Using the NAO robot, we investigate the
impact of an emotionally aligned, empathic, dialogue on these aspects: (i) the
robot's persuasive effectiveness, (ii) the user's communication style, and
(iii) the attribution of mental states and empathy to the robot. In an
experiment with 42 participants, two conditions were compared: one with neutral
communication and another where the robot provided responses adapted to the
emotions expressed by the users. The results show that emotional alignment does
not influence users' communication styles or have a persuasive effect. However,
it significantly influences attribution of mental states to the robot and its
perceived empathy

Abstract: Studying tissue samples obtained during autopsies is the gold standard when
diagnosing the cause of death and for understanding disease pathophysiology.
Recently, the interest in post mortem minimally invasive biopsies has grown
which is a less destructive approach in comparison to an open autopsy and
reduces the risk of infection. While manual biopsies under ultrasound guidance
are more widely performed, robotic post mortem biopsies have been recently
proposed. This approach can further reduce the risk of infection for
physicians. However, planning of the procedure and control of the robot need to
be efficient and usable. We explore a virtual reality setup with a digital twin
to realize fully remote planning and control of robotic post mortem biopsies.
The setup is evaluated with forensic pathologists in a usability study for
three interaction methods. Furthermore, we evaluate clinical feasibility and
evaluate the system with three human cadavers. Overall, 132 needle insertions
were performed with an off-axis needle placement error of 5.30+-3.25 mm. Tissue
samples were successfully biopsied and histopathologically verified. Users
reported a very intuitive needle placement approach, indicating that the system
is a promising, precise, and low-risk alternative to conventional approaches.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在模拟3D洞穴环境中既能快速完成任务，又能保证安全性。

Conclusion: 结合学习控制器和安全控制器的方法可以有效提升无人机在地下环境中的自主性和安全性。

Abstract: Autonomously controlling quadrotors in large-scale subterranean environments
is applicable to many areas such as environmental surveying, mining operations,
and search and rescue. Learning-based controllers represent an appealing
approach to autonomy, but are known to not generalize well to
`out-of-distribution' environments not encountered during training. In this
work, we train a normalizing flow-based prior over the environment, which
provides a measure of how far out-of-distribution the quadrotor is at any given
time. We use this measure as a runtime monitor, allowing us to switch between a
learning-based controller and a safe controller when we are sufficiently
out-of-distribution. Our methods are benchmarked on a point-to-point navigation
task in a simulated 3D cave environment based on real-world point cloud data
from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event Dataset. Our experimental
results show that our combined controller simultaneously possesses the liveness
of the learning-based controller (completing the task quickly) and the safety
of the safety controller (avoiding collision).

Abstract: The small scale of urban farms and the commercial availability of low-cost
robots (such as the FarmBot) that automate simple tending tasks enable an
accessible platform for plant phenotyping. We have used a FarmBot with a custom
camera end-effector to estimate strawberry plant flower pose (for robotic
pollination) from acquired 3D point cloud models. We describe a novel algorithm
that translates individual occupancy grids along orthogonal axes of a point
cloud to obtain 2D images corresponding to the six viewpoints. For each image,
2D object detection models for flowers are used to identify 2D bounding boxes
which can be converted into the 3D space to extract flower point clouds. Pose
estimation is performed by fitting three shapes (superellipsoids, paraboloids
and planes) to the flower point clouds and compared with manually labeled
ground truth. Our method successfully finds approximately 80% of flowers
scanned using our customized FarmBot platform and has a mean flower pose error
of 7.7 degrees, which is sufficient for robotic pollination and rivals previous
results. All code will be made available at

Abstract: The quasi-repetitive nature of construction work and the resulting lack of
generalizability in programming construction robots presents persistent
challenges to the broad adoption of robots in the construction industry. Robots
cannot achieve generalist capabilities as skills learnt from one domain cannot
readily transfer to another work domain or be directly used to perform a
different set of tasks. Human workers have to arduously reprogram their
scene-understanding, path-planning, and manipulation components to enable the
robots to perform alternate work tasks. The methods presented in this paper
resolve a significant proportion of such reprogramming workload by proposing a
generalizable learning architecture that directly teaches robots versatile
task-performance skills through crowdsourced online natural language
instructions. A Large Language Model (LLM), a standardized and modularized
hierarchical modeling approach, and Building Information Modeling-Robot sematic
data pipeline are developed to address the multi-task skill transfer problem.
The proposed skill standardization scheme and LLM-based hierarchical skill
learning framework were tested with a long-horizon drywall installation
experiment using a full-scale industrial robotic manipulator. The resulting
robot task learning scheme achieves multi-task reprogramming with minimal
effort and high quality.

Motivation: 传统SLAM方法在动态环境中表现不佳，现有动态SLAM系统虽然通过添加线、面特征弥补点特征的不足，但会带来不必要的计算开销和性能下降。

Method: 提出特征感知机制，动态评估是否需要引入线特征，并在后续处理中避免低质量特征对全局优化的干扰。

Result: 在TUM数据集上，ATE和RPE指标优于ORB-SLAM3基准和其他动态SLAM方法。

Conclusion: 特征感知机制显著提升了动态SLAM的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a crucial role in
autonomous systems. Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment
assumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic
SLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic
features, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point
features for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by
continuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point
features, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current
methods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity,
causing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential
performance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and
noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism
that evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line
feature support should be activated. This decision mechanism enables the system
to introduce line features only when necessary, significantly reducing
computational complexity of additional features while minimizing the
introduction of low-quality features and noise. In subsequent processing, the
introduced line features assist in obtaining better initial camera poses
through tracking, local mapping, and loop closure, but are excluded from global
optimization to avoid potential negative impacts from low-quality additional
features in long-term process. Extensive experiments on TUM datasets
demonstrate substantial improvements in both ATE and RPE metrics compared to
ORB-SLAM3 baseline and superior performance over other dynamic SLAM and
multi-feature methods.

Conclusion: DUViN是一种无需预建地图的鲁棒水下视觉导航解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited
sensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in
underwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater
Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN,
which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater
vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles
and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain
without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting
large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures
robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater
environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model
transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases:
we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets
using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor
on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into
the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both
simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalization of our approach. The experimental videos are available at

Abstract: In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have gained increasing attention due
to their advantages in mobility, such as high-speed locomotion on flat terrain.
However, their performance on complex environments (e.g., staircases) remains
inferior to that of traditional legged robots. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a general contact-triggered blind climbing (CTBC) framework for wheeled
bipedal robots. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the robot triggers a
leg-lifting motion to overcome the obstacle. By leveraging a strongly-guided
feedforward trajectory, our method enables the robot to rapidly acquire agile
leg-lifting skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse
unstructured terrains. The approach has been experimentally validated and
successfully deployed on LimX Dynamics' wheeled bipedal robot, Tron1.
Real-world tests demonstrate that Tron1 can reliably climb obstacles well
beyond its wheel radius using only proprioceptive feedback.

Conclusion: UT³为资源受限的硬件提供了一种高效且灵活的测试时间训练解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in autonomous
systems. However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a
continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably
faced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on
test-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on
the fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.
However, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as
multiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for
test-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the
fine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications
where these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong
latency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$)
that leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of
continuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it
suitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware
self-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the
quantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp
improvements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard
test-time training protocol. Our proposed protocol offers a continuous setting
to identify the selected keyframes, allowing the end-user to control how often
to apply test-time training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a
dense regression task - monocular depth estimation.

Motivation: 为了提高机械臂的精度并减少关节力矩和反作用力矩，研究开发了一种基于力平衡的机械臂设计，以满足高精度应用需求。

Method: 研究采用了封闭链平面五杆机构，设计了两种模块化变体（Forbal-2和Forbal-5），并通过几何、运动学和动力学设计实现了力平衡条件。推导了两种变体的逆运动学，并通过实验验证了力平衡配置的效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，力平衡配置显著降低了平均反作用力矩（66%）、平均关节力矩（79%-84%），并提高了Forbal-2的位置精度。Forbal-5的关节力矩减少了84%，验证了该设计在高负载下的有效性。

Conclusion: 力平衡机械臂设计适用于需要毫米级精度的应用场景，能够在减少关节力矩和反作用力矩的同时提升机械臂性能。

Abstract: A force balanced manipulator design based on the closed chain planar five bar
linkage is developed and experimentally validated. We present 2 variants as a
modular design: Forbal-2, a planar 2-DOF manipulator, and its extension to
5-DOF spatial motion called Forbal-5. The design considerations in terms of
geometric, kinematic, and dynamic design that fulfill the force balance
conditions while maximizing workspace are discussed. Then, the inverse
kinematics of both variants are derived from geometric principles.
  We validate the improvements from force balancing the manipulator through
comparative experiments with counter mass balanced and unbalanced
configurations. The results show how the balanced configuration yields a
reduction in the average reaction moments of up to 66\%, a reduction of average
joint torques of up to 79\%, as well as a noticeable reduction in position
error for Forbal-2. For Forbal-5, which has a higher end effector payload mass,
the joint torques are reduced up to 84\% for the balanced configuration.
Experimental results validate that the balanced manipulator design is suitable
for applications where the reduction of joint torques and reaction
forces/moments helps achieve millimeter level precision.

Motivation: 现有的深度激光雷达里程计模型需要大量多样化训练数据以适应不同环境，导致效率低下。为解决这一问题，研究提出了一种主动训练框架，优化数据选择过程。

Method: 方法基于两个策略：初始训练集选择（ITSS）和主动增量选择（AIS）。ITSS通过分析轨迹选择多样化序列，AIS则针对复杂场景（如雪天）动态选择样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅需52%的数据量即可达到与全数据集训练相当的性能，提升了训练效率和模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为激光雷达里程计系统提供了更高效和可靠的训练方案，能更精准应对多样化环境条件。

Abstract: Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate
localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse
training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To
tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively
extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training
load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key
strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental
Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general
weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing
diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base
model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under
challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and
prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the
model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across
datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably,
our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of
the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of
our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach
sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of
navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.

Abstract: Intuitive Teleoperation interfaces are essential for mobile manipulation
robots to ensure high quality data collection while reducing operator workload.
A strong sense of embodiment combined with minimal physical and cognitive
demands not only enhances the user experience during large-scale data
collection, but also helps maintain data quality over extended periods. This
becomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation
tasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot
control paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base
navigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as
separate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback
mechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based
visualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were
systematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring
integrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a
feedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and
perceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation
leads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while
preliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation
leads to better imitation learning performance. Our holistic view on intuitive
teleoperation interfaces provides valuable insight into collecting
high-quality, high-dimensional mobile manipulation data at scale with the human
operator in mind. Project

Abstract: Integrating generative AI such as large language models into social robots
has improved their ability to engage in natural, human-like communication. This
study presents a method to examine their persuasive capabilities. We designed
an experimental framework focused on decision making and tested it in a pilot
that varied robot appearance and self-knowledge. Using qualitative analysis, we
evaluated interaction quality, persuasion effectiveness, and the robot's
communicative strategies. Participants generally experienced the interaction
positively, describing the robot as competent, friendly, and supportive, while
noting practical limits such as delayed responses and occasional
speech-recognition errors. Persuasiveness was highly context dependent and
shaped by robot behavior: participants responded well to polite, reasoned
suggestions and expressive gestures, but emphasized the need for more
personalized, context-aware arguments and clearer social roles. These findings
suggest that generative social robots can influence user decisions, but their
effectiveness depends on communicative nuance and contextual relevance. We
propose refinements to the framework to further study persuasive dynamics
between robots and human users.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refurbishment of the interactive robotic
art installation Standards and Double Standards by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. The
installation features an array of belts suspended from the ceiling, each
actuated by stepper motors and dynamically oriented by a vision-based tracking
system that follows the movements of exhibition visitors. The original system
was limited by oscillatory dynamics, resulting in torsional and pendulum-like
vibrations that constrained rotational speed and reduced interactive
responsiveness. To address these challenges, the refurbishment involved
significant upgrades to both hardware and motion control algorithms. A detailed
mathematical model of the flying belt system was developed to accurately
capture its dynamic behavior, providing a foundation for advanced control
design. An input shaping method, formulated as a convex optimization problem,
was implemented to effectively suppress vibrations, enabling smoother and
faster belt movements. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in system performance and audience interaction. This work
exemplifies the integration of robotics, control engineering, and interactive
art, offering new solutions to technical challenges in real-time motion control
and vibration damping for large-scale kinetic installations.

*Elias Fontanari,Gianni Lunardi,Matteo Saveriano,Andrea Del Prete*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过并行计算优化模型预测控制（MPC）中安全性的方法，解决了非线性系统约束满足的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键系统（如机器人）中，确保约束满足至关重要。传统的MPC虽能处理约束，但非线性系统的约束满足仍具挑战。

Method: 作者通过并行计算同时求解多个MPC问题，每个问题在预测时域的不同时间步实例化安全集约束，最终根据用户定义的准则选择最优解。

Result: 通过3关节机器人臂的仿真验证，该方法显著提高了安全性和性能，仅需4个计算核心即可实现。

Conclusion: 并行计算是提升MPC在处理非线性系统约束时安全性和性能的有效手段。

Abstract: Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical
systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be
used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision
avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive
Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints, relying on
numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is
challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make
controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In
our previous work, we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the
safe-set constraint recede along the MPC horizon. In this paper, we push that
idea further by exploiting parallel computation to improve safety. We solve
several MPC problems at the same time, where each problem instantiates the
safe-set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the
controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined
criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint
robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved in terms of
safety and performance, even using as little as 4 computational cores.

Method: 研究采用了一个物联网控制的护士机器人，能够评估患者健康状况并采取相应行动，测试了其在药物管理、健康监测和生命周期管理中的表现。

Result: 护士机器人在药物管理、健康监测和生命周期管理方面表现出色，有效减少了感染风险并提升了医疗效率。

Conclusion: 机器人技术在高风险医疗环境中具有潜力，特别是在疫情等特殊时期，能够显著提高医疗系统的可持续性和盈利能力。

Abstract: The utilization of robotic technology has gained traction in healthcare
facilities due to progress in the field that enables time and cost savings,
minimizes waste, and improves patient care. Digital healthcare technologies
that leverage automation, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, have
the potential to enhance the sustainability and profitability of healthcare
systems in the long run. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has amplified
the need for cyber-physical robots to automate check-ups and medication
administration. A robot nurse is controlled by the Internet of Things (IoT) and
can serve as an automated medical assistant while also allowing supervisory
control based on custom commands. This system helps reduce infection risk and
improves outcomes in pandemic settings. This research presents a test case with
a nurse robot that can assess a patient's health status and take action
accordingly. We also evaluate the system's performance in medication
administration, health-status monitoring, and life-cycle considerations.

workflow to the use case of observing volcanic plumes. We analyze
classification approaches including traditional machine learning algorithms and
convolutional neural networks. We present several trajectory planning
algorithms that track the morphological features of a plume and integrate these
algorithms with the classifiers. We show through simulation an order of

TL;DR: 研究发现Waymo开放运动数据集(WOMD)在真实AV操作中的行为和动态捕捉不足，可能导致行为模型低估驾驶的变异性、风险和复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估WOMD数据集在真实AV行为分析中的有效性，揭示其局限性。

Method: 通过对比WOMD与独立采集的凤凰城AV数据集(PHX)，分析三种典型驾驶场景（信号灯路口、跟车、变道）的行为差异。

Result: 结果显示，PHX的行为明显超出WOMD的行为范围，WOMD低估了短车距和急减速行为。

Conclusion: 仅依赖WOMD校准行为模型可能产生系统性偏差，建议使用前需独立数据验证。

Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for
data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its
validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary
post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of
trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately
captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.
Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV
operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across
three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized
intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging
analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure
negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we
apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically
estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to
quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show
that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,
WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings
suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically
underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.
Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without
proper validation against independently collected data.

Motivation: 传统的导向向量表示方法无法有效处理声场的散射效应，且确定性超分辨率方法容易因测量空间的不均匀性导致过拟合。

Method: 结合神经场（NF）和高斯过程（GP），设计了一种物理感知的复合核模型，用于精确表示声场的定向入射波和散射效应。

Abstract: This paper investigates continuous representations of steering vectors over
frequency and position of microphone and source for augmented listening (e.g.,
spatial filtering and binaural rendering) with precise control of the sound
field perceived by the user. Steering vectors have typically been used for
representing the spatial characteristics of the sound field as a function of
the listening position. The basic algebraic representation of steering vectors
assuming an idealized environment cannot deal with the scattering effect of the
sound field. One may thus collect a discrete set of real steering vectors
measured in dedicated facilities and super-resolve (i.e., upsample) them.
Recently, physics-aware deep learning methods have been effectively used for
this purpose. Such deterministic super-resolution, however, suffers from the
overfitting problem due to the non-uniform uncertainty over the measurement
space. To solve this problem, we integrate an expressive representation based
on the neural field (NF) into the principled probabilistic framework based on
the Gaussian process (GP). Specifically, we propose a physics-aware composite
kernel that model the directional incoming waves and the subsequent scattering
effect. Our comprehensive comparative experiment showed the effectiveness of
the proposed method under data insufficiency conditions. In downstream tasks
such as speech enhancement and binaural rendering using the simulated data of
the SPEAR challenge, the oracle performances were attained with less than ten
times fewer measurements.

Conclusion: 基于学习的轻量级架构和高质量数据训练，成功解决了瞬态-稳态声音分离的未解问题。

Abstract: We are interested in audio systems capable of performing a differentiated
processing of stationary backgrounds and isolated acoustic events within an
acoustic scene, whether for applying specific processing methods to each part
or for focusing solely on one while ignoring the other. Such systems have
applications in real-world scenarios, including robust adaptive audio rendering
systems (e.g., EQ or compression), plosive attenuation in voice mixing, noise
suppression or reduction, robust acoustic event classification or even
bioacoustics. To this end, we introduce IS${}^3$, a neural network designed for
Impulsive--Stationary Sound Separation, that isolates impulsive acoustic events
from the stationary background using a deep filtering approach, that can act as
a pre-processing stage for the above-mentioned tasks. To ensure optimal
training, we propose a sophisticated data generation pipeline that curates and
adapts existing datasets for this task. We demonstrate that a learning-based
approach, build on a relatively lightweight neural architecture and trained
with well-designed and varied data, is successful in this previously
unaddressed task, outperforming the Harmonic--Percussive Sound Separation
masking method, adapted from music signal processing research, and wavelet
filtering on objective separation metrics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding the computational power of mobile robot systems is a
fundamental challenge in distributed computing. While prior work has focused on
pairwise separations between models, we explore how robot capabilities, light
observability, and scheduler synchrony interact in more complex ways.
  We first show that the Exponential Times Expansion (ETE) problem is solvable
only in the strongest model -- fully-synchronous robots with full mutual lights
($\mathcal{LUMT}^F$). We then introduce the Hexagonal Edge Traversal (HET) and
TAR(d)* problems to demonstrate how internal memory and lights interact with
synchrony: under weak synchrony, internal memory alone is insufficient, while
full synchrony can substitute for both lights and memory.
  In the asynchronous setting, we classify problems such as LP-MLCv, VEC, and
ZCC to show fine-grained separations between $\mathcal{FSTA}$ and
$\mathcal{FCOM}$ robots. We also analyze Vertex Traversal Rendezvous (VTR) and
Leave Place Convergence (LP-Cv), illustrating the limitations of internal
memory in symmetric settings.
  These results extend the known separation map of 14 canonical robot models,
revealing structural phenomena only visible through higher-order comparisons.
Our work provides new impossibility criteria and deepens the understanding of
how observability, memory, and synchrony collectively shape the computational
power of mobile robots.

Conclusion: 提出的EM方法能够有效解决带约束的SOC问题，屏障函数的引入显著提升了状态约束的满足效果。

Abstract: Approximate methods to solve stochastic optimal control (SOC) problems have
received significant interest from researchers in the past decade.
Probabilistic inference approaches to SOC have been developed to solve
nonlinear quadratic Gaussian problems. In this work, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based inference procedure to generate
state-feedback controls for constrained SOC problems. We consider the
inequality constraints for the state and controls and also the structural
constraints for the controls. We employ barrier functions to address state and
control constraints. We show that the expectation step leads to smoothing of
the state-control pair while the the maximization step on the non-zero subsets
of the control parameters allows inference of structured stochastic optimal
controllers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on unicycle
obstacle avoidance, four-unicycle formation control, and quadcopter navigation
in windy environment examples. In these examples, we perform an empirical study
on the parametric effect of barrier functions on the state constraint
satisfaction. We also present a comparative study of smoothing algorithms on
the performance of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 传统神经网络在分析周期性或不完全周期性信号时表现不佳，尤其是当信号频率不可公度时。现有的FNNs等方法未能解决非周期性信号的叠加问题，因此需要一种更有效的模型来应对此类任务。

Method: 作者提出了一种名为AR-KAN的混合模型，结合了Kolmogorov-Arnold Network（KAN）的静态非线性部分和预训练的Autoregressive（AR）组件的记忆能力，利用Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem来保留有用信息并消除冗余。

Result: 实验结果表明，AR-KAN在72%的真实数据集上表现优于传统神经网络和其他模型（如ARIMA）。

Conclusion: AR-KAN通过结合KAN和AR方法的优势，有效解决了传统神经网络在信号频谱分析中的局限性，尤其是在处理非周期性信号方面表现突出。

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

Conclusion: VendiRL提供了一种统一的技能多样性学习框架，解决了现有方法的不一致性问题。

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that robotic coaches can play a crucial role in
promoting wellbeing. However, the real-world deployment of wellbeing robots
raises numerous ethical and socio-technical questions and concerns. To explore
these questions, we undertake a community-centered investigation to examine
three different communities' perspectives on using robotic wellbeing coaches in
real-world environments. We frame our work as an anticipatory ethical
investigation, which we undertake to better inform the development of robotic
technologies with communities' opinions, with the ultimate goal of aligning
robot development with public interest. We conducted workshops with three
communities who are under-represented in robotics development: 1) members of
the public at a science festival, 2) women computer scientists at a conference,
and 3) humanities researchers interested in history and philosophy of science.
In the workshops, we collected qualitative data using the Social Robot
Co-Design Canvas on Ethics. We analysed the collected qualitative data with
Thematic Analysis, informed by notes taken during workshops. Through our
analysis, we identify four themes regarding key ethical and socio-technical
questions about the real-world use of wellbeing robots. We group participants'
insights and discussions around these broad thematic questions, discuss them in
light of state-of-the-art literature, and highlight areas for future
investigation. Finally, we provide the four questions as a broad framework that
roboticists can and should use during robotic development and deployment, in
order to reflect on the ethics and socio-technical dimensions of their robotic
applications, and to engage in dialogue with communities of robot users. The
four questions are: 1) Is the robot safe and how can we know that?, 2) Who is
the robot built for and with?, 3) Who owns the robot and the data?, and 4) Why
a robot?.

Abstract: We present a decentralized model for autonomous reconfiguration of
homogeneous pivoting cube modular robots in two dimensions. Each cube in the
ensemble is controlled by a neural network that only gains information from
other cubes in its local neighborhood, trained using reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, using geometric deep learning, we include the grid symmetries of
the cube ensemble in the neural network architecture. We find that even the
most localized versions succeed in reconfiguring to the target shape, although
reconfiguration happens faster the more information about the whole ensemble is
available to individual cubes. Near-optimal reconfiguration is achieved with
only nearest neighbor interactions by using multiple information passing
between cubes, allowing them to accumulate more global information about the
ensemble. Compared to standard neural network architectures, using geometric
deep learning approaches provided only minor benefits. Overall, we successfully
demonstrate mostly local control of a modular self-assembling system, which is
transferable to other space-relevant systems with different action spaces, such
as sliding cube modular robots and CubeSat swarms.

Conclusion: 研究暴露了嵌入式AI系统中未被充分探索但关键的安全问题，强调了物理AI时代安全防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

Result: SAM-LLM将输出大小减少80%，意图预测准确率达到98.73%，保持了与传统LLM相同的性能，但在可解释性和资源效率上更具优势。

Conclusion: SAM-LLM提供了一种高效、可解释且物理精确的车道变换轨迹预测方法，为自动驾驶系统提供了显著优势。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以利用强大的大规模语言模型（LLM）和多模态视觉语言模型（VLM）来提升端到端自动驾驶任务的性能。

Method: 采用端到端架构设计，结合知识丰富的VLM，仅使用单摄像头进行驾驶任务。

Result: 该方法在单摄像头解决方案中表现最佳，验证了视觉驱动方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合VLM的端到端设计在自动驾驶任务中具有显著潜力，尤其是在单摄像头条件下表现优异。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

### [47] [AI Safety Assurance in Electric Vehicles: A Case Study on AI-Driven SOC Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03270)
*Martin Skoglund,Fredrik Warg,Aria Mirzai,Anders Thorsen,Karl Lundgren,Peter Folkesson,Bastian Havers-zulka*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何结合ISO 26262和ISO/PAS 8800标准对电动汽车中的AI功能进行独立评估，并以AI驱动的电池状态估计为例，验证了该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法无法有效评估基于AI的功能，需要新的标准和方法来确保AI在电动汽车中的安全性。

Method: 结合ISO 26262和ISO/PAS 8800标准，对AI组件进行独立评估，并通过故障注入实验测试其鲁棒性。

Result: 研究提出了一种扩展的评估方法，并通过实验验证了AI组件对输入扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结合现有标准可以为AI在电动汽车中的安全评估提供有效方法，但需进一步优化以适应不断发展的AI技术。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in electric vehicles (EV)
introduces unique challenges for safety assurance, particularly within the
framework of ISO 26262, which governs functional safety in the automotive
domain. Traditional assessment methodologies are not geared toward evaluating
AI-based functions and require evolving standards and practices. This paper
explores how an independent assessment of an AI component in an EV can be
achieved when combining ISO 26262 with the recently released ISO/PAS 8800,
whose scope is AI safety for road vehicles. The AI-driven State of Charge (SOC)
battery estimation exemplifies the process. Key features relevant to the
independent assessment of this extended evaluation approach are identified. As
part of the evaluation, robustness testing of the AI component is conducted
using fault injection experiments, wherein perturbed sensor inputs are
systematically introduced to assess the component's resilience to input
variance.

### [48] [Dependency Chain Analysis of ROS 2 DDS QoS Policies: From Lifecycle Tutorial to Static Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03381)
*Sanghoon Lee,Junha Kang,Kyung-Joon Park*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: ROS 2用户缺乏关于DDS QoS政策的明确指导，导致运行时问题。研究分析了DDS通信生命周期，提出QoS依赖链，并开发了QoS Guard工具，用于离线验证配置文件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROS 2依赖DDS的QoS政策，但缺乏安全组合的指导和验证流程，导致运行时失败和资源浪费。

Method: 分析DDS通信生命周期（发现、数据交换、解除关联），提出QoS依赖链，并开发静态验证工具QoS Guard。

Result: 41条依赖违规规则被分类，QoS Guard工具能离线检测配置冲突。

Conclusion: 研究提供了ROS 2用户概念性指导和安全工具，提升了系统可靠性和资源效率。

Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) relies on the Data Distribution Service
(DDS), which offers more than 20 Quality of Service (QoS) policies governing
availability, reliability, and resource usage. Yet ROS 2 users lack clear
guidance on safe policy combinations and validation processes prior to
deployment, which often leads to trial-and-error tuning and unexpected runtime
failures. To address these challenges, we analyze DDS Publisher-Subscriber
communication over a life cycle divided into Discovery, Data Exchange, and
Disassociation, and provide a user oriented tutorial explaining how 16 QoS
policies operate in each phase. Building on this analysis, we derive a QoS
dependency chain that formalizes inter-policy relationships and classifies 41
dependency violation rules, capturing constraints that commonly cause
communication failures in practice. Finally, we introduce QoS Guard, a ROS 2
package that statically validates DDS XML profiles offline, flags conflicts,
and enables safe, predeployment tuning without establishing a live ROS 2
session. Together, these contributions give ROS 2 users both conceptual insight
and a concrete tool that enables early detection of misconfigurations,
improving the reliability and resource efficiency of ROS 2 based robotic
systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型头戴设备集成技术，通过计算机触发的摄像头和红外发射器创建结构阴影，实现了对日常物体表面的高精度触摸事件检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合现实系统长期以来致力于在不依赖额外设备的情况下检测日常物体表面的触摸事件，虚拟界面绑定物理表面的性能和人机工程学优势是核心动机。

Method: 该系统采用头戴设备集成的技术，结合计算机触发的摄像头和红外发射器生成结构阴影，用于估计悬停距离和触摸接触。

Result: 该方法在悬停距离估计上的平均误差为6.9毫米，触摸检测准确率达到98%，且在不同表面材料、交互方向和环境光条件下表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究证明该技术在多种条件下均能有效工作，为混合现实系统中的触摸检测提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to detect touch events on uninstrumented, everyday surfaces has
been a long-standing goal for mixed reality systems. Prior work has shown that
virtual interfaces bound to physical surfaces offer performance and ergonomic
benefits over tapping at interfaces floating in the air. A wide variety of
approaches have been previously developed, to which we contribute a new
headset-integrated technique called \systemname. We use a combination of a
computer-triggered camera and one or more infrared emitters to create
structured shadows, from which we can accurately estimate hover distance (mean
error of 6.9~mm) and touch contact (98.0\% accuracy). We discuss how our
technique works across a range of conditions, including surface material,
interaction orientation, and environmental lighting.

### [50] [SmartPoser: Arm Pose Estimation with a Smartphone and Smartwatch Using UWB and IMU Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03451)
*Nathan DeVrio,Vimal Mollyn,Chris Harrison*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用智能手机和智能手表通过超宽带（UWB）和惯性数据结合来估计手臂姿势的软件方法，避免了隐私问题和多设备穿戴的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手臂姿势追踪系统依赖摄像头（隐私问题）或多IMU设备（穿戴复杂），本文旨在通过普通消费设备实现高效追踪。

Method: 结合智能手机和智能手表的超宽带（UWB）测距功能和惯性数据，无需训练数据即可估计手腕和肘部位置。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法的手腕和肘部位置估计中位误差为11.0厘米。

Conclusion: 该方法为消费级设备提供了一种高效、隐私友好的手臂姿势追踪解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to track a user's arm pose could be valuable in a wide range of
applications, including fitness, rehabilitation, augmented reality input, life
logging, and context-aware assistants. Unfortunately, this capability is not
readily available to consumers. Systems either require cameras, which carry
privacy issues, or utilize multiple worn IMUs or markers. In this work, we
describe how an off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch can work together to
accurately estimate arm pose. Moving beyond prior work, we take advantage of
more recent ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on these devices to capture
absolute distance between the two devices. This measurement is the perfect
complement to inertial data, which is relative and suffers from drift. We
quantify the performance of our software-only approach using off-the-shelf
devices, showing it can estimate the wrist and elbow joints with a \hl{median
positional error of 11.0~cm}, without the user having to provide training data.
