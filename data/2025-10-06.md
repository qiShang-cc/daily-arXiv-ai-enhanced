### [1] [Rate-Adaptive Semantic Communication via Multi-Stage Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02646)
*Jinsung Park,Junyong Shin,Yongjeong Oh,Jihun Park,Yo-Seb Jeon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多阶段向量量化（VQ）的新型速率自适应语义通信框架MSVQ-SC，通过动态激活阶段和模块实现细粒度速率适应，并降低了计算复杂度和码本崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单阶段VQ方法需要指数级增大的码本以实现高保真度，限制了效率和灵活性。

Method: 多阶段VQ分解量化过程，动态激活模块和阶段；结合增量分配算法优化模块选择；引入熵编码进一步降低通信开销。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，MSVQ-SC优于现有数字语义通信方法，实现了更高的语义保真度和更低的复杂度。

Conclusion: MSVQ-SC框架在速率控制和性能之间取得了更好的平衡，为语义通信提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for rate-adaptive semantic
communication based on multi-stage vector quantization (VQ), termed
\textit{MSVQ-SC}. Unlike conventional single-stage VQ approaches, which require
exponentially larger codebooks to achieve higher fidelity, the proposed
framework decomposes the quantization process into multiple stages and
dynamically activates both stages and individual VQ modules. This design
enables fine-grained rate adaptation under varying bit constraints while
mitigating computational complexity and the codebook collapse problem. To
optimize performance, we formulate a module selection problem that minimizes
task loss subject to a rate constraint and solve it using an incremental
allocation algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the framework by incorporating
entropy coding to exploit non-uniform codeword distributions, further reducing
communication overhead. Simulation results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate
that the proposed framework outperforms existing digital semantic communication
methods, achieving superior semantic fidelity with lower complexity while
providing flexible and fine-grained rate control.

### [2] [Mutual Information-Driven Visualization and Clustering for Core KPI Selection in O-RAN Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02696)
*Anish Pradhan,Lingjia Liu,Harpreet S. Dhillon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了AMIF-MDS方法，通过AMIF量化时间序列依赖关系，并利用MDS可视化，结合DBSCAN聚类识别核心性能指标，简化O-RAN测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着O-RAN系统复杂性增加，性能测量数量激增，测试难度加大。需要识别性能测量间的依赖关系以简化测试和改进设计。

Method: 采用AMIF作为DI的实用替代，结合MDS可视化依赖关系；提出基于分位数的AMIF估计器，应用DBSCAN聚类识别核心性能指标。

Result: 成功识别了性能测量间的依赖关系，提取出核心性能指标集，为未来学习驱动的O-RAN测试提供基础。

Conclusion: AMIF-MDS方法有效简化了O-RAN测试复杂性，并通过核心指标集提升了测试效率。

Abstract: O-RAN testing is becoming increasingly difficult with the exponentially
growing number of performance measurements as the system grows more complex,
with additional units, interfaces, applications, and possible implementations
and configurations. To simplify the testing procedure and improve system design
for O-RAN systems, it is important to identify the dependencies among various
performance measurements, which are inherently time-series and can be modeled
as realizations of random processes. While information theory can be utilized
as a principled foundation for mapping these dependencies, the robust
estimation of such measures for random processes from real-world data remains
challenging. This paper introduces AMIF-MDS, which employs aggregate mutual
Information in frequency (AMIF), a practical proxy for directed information
(DI), to quantify similarity and visualize inter-series dependencies with
multidimensional scaling (MDS). The proposed quantile-based AMIF estimator is
applied to O-RAN time-series testing data to identify dependencies among
various performance measures so that we can focus on a set of ``core''
performance measures. Applying density-based spatial clustering of applications
with noise (DBSCAN) to the MDS embedding groups mutually informative metrics,
organically reveals the link-adaptation indicators among other clusters, and
yields a ``core'' performance measure set for future learning-driven O-RAN
testing.

### [3] [Denoising and Augmentation: A Dual Use of Diffusion Model for Enhanced CSI Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02744)
*Yupeng Li,Ruhao Zhang,Yitong Liu,Chunju Shao,Jing Jin,Shijian Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于DDPM的信道估计算法，结合数据去噪和增强，提高了信道估计的精度和计算效率。

Result: 仿真表明，该方法在精度和计算成本之间实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 该算法为信道估计提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This letter introduces a dual application of denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM)-based channel estimation algorithm integrating data
denoising and augmentation. Denoising addresses the severe noise in raw signals
at pilot locations, which can impair channel estimation accuracy. An
unsupervised structure is proposed to clean field data without prior knowledge
of pure channel information. Data augmentation is crucial due to the
data-intensive nature of training deep learning (DL) networks for channel state
information (CSI) estimation. The network generates new channel data by
adjusting reverse steps, enriching the training dataset. To manage varying
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in communication data, a piecewise forward
strategy is proposed to enhance the DDPM convergence precision. The link-level
simulations indicate that the proposed scheme achieves a superior tradeoff
between precision and computational cost compared to existing benchmarks.

Result: 实验结果显示信噪比显著提升（从11 dB到22 dB），证明了方案在低信噪比环境下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方案显著提升了多标签环境中环境反向散射定位的可扩展性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recently, a novel ultra-low-power indoor localization system based on
Zero-Energy Devices (ZEDs) has shown promising results in ambient backscatter
communication. In this paper, we study detection of multiple coexisting ZEDs in
ambient backscatter systems under interference and synchronization uncertainty.
Building on a Neyman-Pearson (NP) formulation previously applied to single-tag
detection, we introduce a detector tailored to multi-tag scenarios. The core
idea is to use a Near-Perfect Code (NPC) as the synchronization sequence, which
substantially improves the peak-to-sidelobe (PSL) ratio and thus separability
among concurrent tags. The proposed scheme replaces dual band-pass filtering
with dual correlators, enabling an explicit Bayesian detector and tight control
of the false-alarm rate; we further incorporate a contrast metric and
multi-frequency combining to reveal secondary tags. Experiments on the
CorteXlab testbed (part of the SLICES-EU infrastructure) confirm robustness at
low SNR, with observed PSL improvements from about 11 dB to about 22 dB. These
results advance scalable, reliable ambient backscatter localization in
practical multi-tag environments.

Abstract: The mid-band frequency range, combined with extra large-scale multiple-input
multiple-output (XL-MIMO), is emerging as a key enabler for future
communication systems. Thanks to the advent of new spectrum resources and
degrees of freedom brought by the near-field propagation, the mid-band XL-MIMO
system is expected to significantly enhance throughput and inherently support
advanced functionalities such as integrated sensing and communication. Although
theoretical studies have highlighted the benefits of mid-band XL-MIMO systems,
the promised performance gains have yet to be validated in practical systems,
posing a major challenge to the standardization. In this paper, preliminaries
are first discussed, followed by an analysis of key challenges in constructing
a real-time prototype system. Subsequently, the design and implementation of a
real-time mid-band XL-MIMO prototype system are presented. Benefiting from the
novel architecture, the proposed prototype system supports metrics aligned with
standardization, including a bandwidth of 200 MHz, up to 1024 antenna elements,
and up to 256 transceiver chains. Operating in time-division duplexing (TDD)
mode, the prototype enables multiuser communication with support for up to 12
users, while retaining standard communication procedures. Built on
software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, the system is programmable and allows
for flexible deployment of advanced algorithms. Moreover, the modular
architecture ensures high scalability, making the system adaptable to various
configurations, including distributed deployments and decentralized signal
processing. Experimental results with the proposed prototype system demonstrate
real-time digital sample processing at 1167.85 Gbps, a peak data throughput of
15.81 Gbps for 12 users, and a maximal spectral efficiency approaching 80
bit/s/Hz.

Abstract: In this correspondence, a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
framework is proposed to accomplish data communication, vehicle positioning,
and environment sensing simultaneously in a cellular vehicular network. By
incorporating the vehicle positioning problem with the existing
computational-imaging-based ISAC models, we formulate a special integrated
sensing, communication, and positioning problem in which the unknowns are
highly coupled. To mitigate the rank deficiency and make it solvable, we
discretize the region of interest (ROI) into sensing and positioning pixels
respectively, and exploit both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight
propagation of the vehicles' uplink access signals. The resultant problem is
shown to be a polynomial bilinear compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction
problem, which is then solved by the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to
iteratively achieve symbol detection, vehicle positioning and environment
sensing. Performance analysis and numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 研究成果可为神经调控和神经假肢应用的刺激策略设计提供依据。

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between nerve anatomy and the functional
outcomes of electrical stimulation is critical for optimizing neural interface
design. In this study, we conducted acute experiments on four pigs in which
epineural cuff electrodes with multiple contacts were placed around upper limb
nerves. A subset of electrical stimulation configurations -- previously
identified via computational study -- was applied, and the resulting evoked
electromyographic (EMG) responses were recorded from target muscles. Muscle
recruitment curves were extracted and analysed offline to quantify activation
patterns. Following the electrophysiological experiments, the stimulated nerves
were harvested and processed for histological analysis to visualize fascicular
organization and distribution. This work presents preliminary results from the
combined analysis of muscle activation profiles and fascicle anatomy in one
animal. Our findings aim to inform the design of stimulation strategies by
linking electrode configuration to selective muscle recruitment, ultimately
contributing to more effective neuromodulation and neuroprosthetic
applications.

Result: 数值模拟验证显示，Inc-GAN能基于实际列车运营的测量数据准确预测电场分布，显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: Inc-GAN为基于实际运营数据的铁路通信系统优化提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: High-speed railway tunnel communication systems require reliable radio wave
propagation prediction to ensure operational safety. However, conventional
simulation methods face challenges of high computational complexity and
inability to effectively process sparse measurement data collected during
actual railway operations. This letter proposes an inception-enhanced
generative adversarial network (Inc-GAN) that can reconstruct complete electric
field distributions across tunnel cross-sections using sparse value lines
measured during actual train operations as input. This directly addresses
practical railway measurement constraints. Through an inception-based generator
architecture and progressive training strategy, the method achieves robust
reconstruction from single measurement signal lines to complete field
distributions. Numerical simulation validation demonstrates that Inc-GAN can
accurately predict electric fields based on measured data collected during
actual train operations, with significantly improved computational efficiency
compared to traditional methods, providing a novel solution for railway
communication system optimization based on real operational data.

TL;DR: ADMM-CMS是一种基于ADMM算法的多频带压缩感知方法，用于6G中的ISAC，提高了空间分辨率和去噪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多频带环境中用户和散射体的联合检测与定位对6G的ISAC至关重要。现有方法受限，需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出ADMM-CMS框架，利用上行QAM调制导频符号，开发自适应ADMM算法以适应噪声并自动停止收敛。

Result: ADMM-CMS相比传统方法提高了空间分辨率，减少了延迟误差，并在功率效率上有显著增益。

Conclusion: ADMM-CMS是6G FR3频段中ISAC的高效实现方法。

Abstract: Joint detection and localization of users and scatterers in multipath-rich
channels on multiple bands is critical for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) in 6G. Existing multiband sensing methods are limited by classical
beamforming or computationally expensive approaches. This paper introduces
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-assisted compressed
multiband sensing (CMS), hereafter referred to as ADMM-CMS, which is a novel
framework for multiband sensing using uplink QAM-modulated pilot symbols. To
solve the CMS problem, we develop an adaptive ADMM algorithm that adjusts to
noise and ensures automatic stopping if converged. ADMM combines the
decomposability of dual ascent with the robustness of augmented Lagrangian
methods, making it suitable for large-scale structured optimization.
Simulations show that ADMM-CMS achieves higher spatial resolution and improved
denoising compared to Bartlett-type beamforming, yielding a 34 dB gain in
per-antenna transmit power for achieving a 0.9 successful recovery probability
(SRP). Moreover, compared to performing compressed sensing separately on the
constituent 7 GHz and 10 GHz sub-bands, ADMM-CMS achieves reductions in delay
root mean squared error of 35% and 38.1%, respectively, at -41 dBm per-antenna
transmit power, while also yielding improved SRP. Our findings demonstrate
ADMM-CMS as an efficient enabler of ISAC in frequency range 3 (FR3, 7-24 GHz)
for 6G systems.

*Rom Hirsch,Ziv Aharoni,Henry D. Pfister,Haim H. Permuter*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文改编并分析了神经极性解码器（NPD）在端到端通信系统中的应用，展示了其在真实场景中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的在于将NPD从合成信道扩展到实际通信系统，满足实际需求并提升性能。

Method: 通过速率匹配、高阶调制和适应多信道条件等技术，将NPD扩展到OFDM和单载波系统中，直接在有记忆的信道上运行。

Result: 实验结果表明，NPD在5G信道中优于标准5G极性解码器，尤其在低速率和短块配置下表现突出。

Conclusion: NPD是一种高性能、无需导频且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于实际通信系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we adapt and analyze Neural Polar Decoders (NPDs) for
end-to-end communication systems. While prior work demonstrated the
effectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to
real-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and
single-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements,
the NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order
modulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates
directly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher
data rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails
higher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural
network architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics,
resulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental
results over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the
5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are
particularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are
prevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier
systems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling
effective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels. These results position
the NPD as a high-performance, pilotless, and robust decoding solution.

Abstract: We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an
extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows
users to create and dynamically reconfigure environments while they plan robot
paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a greater
spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural interaction
capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the environment
similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard with the
scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system integrates
with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to send motion
planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in virtual or
augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction modalities, allowing
users to modify objects in the environment and interact with a virtual robot.
Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions, ensuring desired
behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk of collisions
within a virtual space, and to then deploy planned paths on physical robots in
the real world.

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising

natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed
scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise
and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing,
including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles
and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through
multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all
agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's
extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of
scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在动态环境中操作时,感知信息可能延迟、嘈杂或过时,U-LAG旨在解决这一问题,提升任务成功率。

Method: 提出UAR-PF,一种不确定性感知的重定向器,处理感知滞后下的位姿分布,并结合Shift x Lag压力测试在多种任务中验证。

Result: 在0-10 cm位移和0-400 ms延迟的测试中,UAR-PF和ICP表现优于基线,实现了更高的成功率和更少的任务中止。

Conclusion: U-LAG通过插拔式重定向模块和不确定性感知技术,显著提升了动态环境下机器人操作的鲁棒性和成功率。

Abstract: Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are
late, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer
that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals
(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion
retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming
as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main
technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that
maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals
that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag
stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion,
where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception
lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags,
UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving
higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple
operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for
lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting
interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on
pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.

the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy
extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman
realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that
only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input
couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear
realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path
planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine
the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of
finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC
counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space.
Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for
linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear
state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to
linear problems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了触觉反馈和虚拟现实（VR）控制界面的结合，以提升水下ROV（遥控操作车辆）的远程操作。提出了一种名为SubSense的新框架，整合了触觉反馈和VR技术，增强了操作的沉浸感和感官反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的ROV远程操作依赖于低分辨率的2D摄像头，缺乏沉浸感和感官反馈，降低了复杂水下环境中的情境感知。

Method: 论文提出了SubSense框架，将非侵入式触觉反馈接口与1自由度机械臂配对，并通过VR平台管理控制输入和沉浸式摄像头视图。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该框架在精细操作任务中优于传统远程操作界面。

Conclusion: 多感官反馈在沉浸式虚拟环境中显著提高了远程情境感知和任务性能，为ROV操作提供了更直观和便捷的方式。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of haptic feedback and virtual
reality (VR) control interfaces to enhance teleoperation and telemanipulation
of underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Traditional ROV teleoperation
relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive and sensory
feedback, which diminishes situational awareness in complex subsea
environments. We propose SubSense -- a novel VR-Haptic framework incorporating
a non-invasive feedback interface to an otherwise 1-DOF (degree of freedom)
manipulator, which is paired with the teleoperator's glove to provide haptic
feedback and grasp status. Additionally, our framework integrates end-to-end
software for managing control inputs and displaying immersive camera views
through a VR platform. We validate the system through comprehensive experiments
and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness over conventional
teleoperation interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks. Our
results highlight the potential of multisensory feedback in immersive virtual
environments to significantly improve remote situational awareness and mission
performance, offering more intuitive and accessible ROV operations in the
field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用策略在受限机器人（如空中操纵器）中因控制和动态不匹配而导致的执行不佳问题。

Result: 在多个任务中表现出更高的成功率、效率和鲁棒性，并能适应新环境。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用操纵技能在不同具体化中的扩展提供了实用途径。

Abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Air, a framework for embodiment-aware deployment of
embodiment-agnostic manipulation policies. Our approach leverages diverse,
unconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to
train generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring
these policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial
manipulators-is the mismatch in control and robot dynamics, which often leads
to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we
propose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level
UMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.
By integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the
diffusion sampling process, our method steers trajectory generation towards
dynamically feasible modes tailored to the deployment embodiment. This enables
plug-and-play, embodiment-aware trajectory adaptation at test time. We validate
our approach on multiple long-horizon and high-precision aerial manipulation
tasks, showing improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under
disturbances compared to unguided diffusion baselines. Finally, we demonstrate
deployment in previously unseen environments, using UMI demonstrations
collected in the wild, highlighting a practical pathway for scaling
generalizable manipulation skills across diverse-and even highly
constrained-embodiments. All code, data, and checkpoints will be publicly
released after acceptance. Result videos can be found at umi-on-air.github.io.

Conclusion: 该方法在动态环境中表现优异，具有竞争力和实用性。

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays an important role in many
robotics fields, including social robots. Many of the available visual SLAM
methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic
environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM
approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system
can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure
robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation
of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the
impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation
process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects
that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to
fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This
highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can
achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on
dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach
delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art
methods, all while operating in near real-time. The source code is publicly
available.

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm capable of driving a system to follow a

Motivated by a critical failure scenario in which a system can experience an
abrupt change in its dynamics, we demonstrate that it is possible to follow a
set of waypoints comprised of states analytically proven to be reachable
despite not knowing the system dynamics. The proposed algorithm first applies
small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current
state, then computes the set of states that are provably reachable using the
locally learned dynamics and their corresponding maximum growth-rate bounds,
and finally synthesizes a control action that navigates the system to a
guaranteed reachable state.

Abstract: Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications
such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of
collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as
a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot
communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few
existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation
navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks,
particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control
framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating
System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements
in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates
over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for
implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit,
we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations
to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic
movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of
hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable
navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment
demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square
formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches.
Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our
framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$
and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while
navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了数据不足的问题，提升了轨迹预测模型在高密度场景下的性能。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径规划方法（如A*和Dijkstra）在大规模地图中效率低下，而LLM-A*虽引入LLM生成路径点，但仍存在高计算时间和性能瓶颈。

Method: 设计iLLM-A*算法，包含A*优化、LLM增量学习和高质量路径点选择机制。

Result: 相比LLM-A*，iLLM-A*速度提升1000倍以上，内存节省58.6%，路径长度更短且更稳定。

Conclusion: iLLM-A*通过创新机制有效解决了大规模地图路径规划的效率和性能问题。

Abstract: Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered
significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their
variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

Abstract: Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics,
requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases
based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge
addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided
cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and
ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial
retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between
text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method:
Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse
ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline
model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images
for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed
captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of
their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal
similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the
original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual
content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves
upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key
metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the
challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement
strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

Result: 在真实机器人任务中验证，策略表现出可靠的接触维持和对新条件的适应性。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效提升了视觉运动策略在接触密集型任务中的性能。

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich
tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require
continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,
most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of
physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact
forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information
into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,
but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data
scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing
processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the
Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating
force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human
demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the
performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our
approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a
bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact
maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions. Project Website:

Conclusion: REACT-Drive显著提升了VLM在工作区域轨迹规划中的性能，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

Motivation: 传统的开环FES控制器在管理足下垂时存在过度刺激或刺激不足的问题，导致肌肉疲劳或跌倒风险增加。

Method: 研究者设计了一种闭环FES控制器，根据实时足趾间隙动态调整刺激强度，并在健康参与者中模拟足下垂进行实验。

Conclusion: 新型闭环FES控制器不仅效果与传统系统相当，还能减少肌肉疲劳并提升长期使用的舒适性和依从性。

Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES),
typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation
intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external
controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and
discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases
fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that
dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance,
providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop
in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller
with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions,
including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that
our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without
significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the
ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to
the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not
only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the
potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and
adherence.

Conclusion: 动作偏差感知混合推理在分布式ML中有效降低了延迟和资源消耗，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model
only inference.

Conclusion: UWB SAR成像技术可以增强机器人感知系统的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and
cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility
conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have
emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse
environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small
apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed
image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large
aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The
resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition
representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a
pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an
unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature
detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB
SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental
conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR
imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection
toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate
safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm
integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that
categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point
clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion
states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic
point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to
construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier
functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed
algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic
obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified
through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD
map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In
simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline
approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in
obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the
robotics community.

Motivation: 社会导航评估复杂且耗资源，缺乏标准指标，希望找到量化指标以替代人为评估。

Method: 研究数值指标与人类评价之间的相关性。

Result: 现有指标部分捕捉导航行为，但主观因素仍需新指标。

Conclusion: 需开发新指标以更好反映人类感知。

Abstract: Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the
integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such
systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be
considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,
provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to
reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation
metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks
consensus on a standard set of metrics.
  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and
human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific
quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as
standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results
indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation
behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and
new metrics are necessary.

Conclusion: 该设计结构简单且高效，连续控制策略在实际应用中表现良好。

Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is
presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms
attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal
bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the
robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based
on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for
repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing
the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is
proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide
mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy
accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two
strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control
strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system,
and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are
experimentally validated.

Abstract: Achieving precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover
remains a significant challenge for tail-sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), primarily due to complex aerodynamic couplings and the absence of
welldefined lateral dynamics. This paper presents a novel modeling and control
strategy that enhances yaw authority and lateral motion by introducing a
sideslip force model derived from differential propeller slipstream effects
acting on the fuselage under differential thrust. The resulting lateral force
along the body y-axis enables yaw-based lateral position control without
inducing roll coupling. The control framework employs a YXZ Euler rotation
formulation to accurately represent attitude and incorporate gravitational
components while directly controlling yaw in the yaxis, thereby improving
lateral dynamic behavior and avoiding singularities. The proposed approach is
validated through trajectory-tracking simulations conducted in a Unity-based
environment. Tests on both rectangular and circular paths in hover mode
demonstrate stable performance, with low mean absolute position errors and yaw
deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees. These results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed lateral force generation model and provide a
foundation for the development of agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for estimating the position and
orientation of flexible manipulators undergoing vertical motion using multiple
inertial measurement units (IMUs), optimized and calibrated with ground truth
data. The flexible links are modeled as a series of rigid segments, with joint
angles estimated from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements acquired by
cost-effective IMUs. A complementary filter is employed to fuse the
measurements, with its parameters optimized through particle swarm optimization
(PSO) to mitigate noise and delay. To further improve estimation accuracy,
residual errors in position and orientation are compensated using radial basis
function neural networks (RBFNN). Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation
method, achieving root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.00021~m, 0.00041~m, and
0.00024~rad for $y$, $z$, and $\theta$, respectively.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a
heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance
of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety
considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected
by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for
such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting
nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This
framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various
sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The
controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it
demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.
This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing
nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented
on skid-steered mobile platforms.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged
as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable
convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating
long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across
various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray
coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their
predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they
can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.
Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or
extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations
highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making
diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By
iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and
conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent
motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method
improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to
unseen shapes, paving the way for unified end-to-end trajectory learning across
industrial surface-processing tasks without category-specific models. On
average, our approach improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2\% and
smoothness by 97.0\%, while increasing surface coverage by 61\% compared to
prior methods. The link to our code can be found

Conclusion: HumanoidExo填补了真实机器人数据的不足，显著提升了泛化能力和学习效率。

Abstract: A significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning is the acquisition of
large-scale, diverse datasets, as collecting reliable real-world data remains
both difficult and cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we introduce
HumanoidExo, a novel system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid
data. HumanoidExo offers a high-efficiency solution that minimizes the
embodiment gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, thereby tackling
the scarcity of whole-body humanoid data. By facilitating the collection of
more voluminous and diverse datasets, our approach significantly enhances the
performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, real-world scenarios. We evaluated
our method across three challenging real-world tasks: table-top manipulation,
manipulation integrated with stand-squat motions, and whole-body manipulation.
Our results empirically demonstrate that HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to
real-robot data, as it enables the humanoid policy to generalize to novel
environments, learn complex whole-body control from only five real-robot
demonstrations, and even acquire new skills (i.e., walking) solely from
HumanoidExo data.

Abstract: Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is important for the safe and
efficient operation of autonomous robots and vehicles in environments shared
with humans. Accurate predictions are important for applications including
motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In
this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or
spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for
horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that
supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most
likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further,
a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary
across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three
types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed
method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average
displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest
accuracy overall. Project code is available at

Abstract: Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both
intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse
real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on
optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper
argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical
structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this
approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to
optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts.
Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively
underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and
necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges,
we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration,
Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential
role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and
community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies,
we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to
long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing
the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.

Abstract: Tiny flying robots hold great potential for search-and-rescue, safety
inspections, and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits
conventional sensing-especially with poor-lighting, smoke, dust or reflective
obstacles. Inspired by nature, we propose a lightweight, 3.2-gram,
whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling them to
navigate and explore through gentle physical interaction. Just as rats and
moles use whiskers to perceive surroundings, our system equips drones with
tactile perception in flight, allowing obstacle sensing even in pitch-dark
conditions. The apparatus uses barometer-based whisker sensors to detect
obstacle locations while minimising destabilisation. To address sensor noise
and drift, we develop a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm
accuracy. This enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore
confined spaces solely through touch-even in total darkness along both soft and
rigid surfaces. Running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller, the system
supports autonomous tactile flight and is validated in both simulation and
real-world tests. Our bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation,
opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments.

Abstract: Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and
reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for
complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of
system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel
framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data,
enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing
detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural
network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our
approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given
trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow
for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining
high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate
that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a
robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,
real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal
control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system
behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is
open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.

Conclusion: VLA模型能够有效学习多样化导航能力，并在复杂环境中实现强泛化。

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: For typical applications of UAVs in power grid scenarios, we construct the
problem as planning UAV trajectories for coverage in cluttered environments. In
this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning
algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for
Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting
points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering
trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth
coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can
smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

Result: 在6个网格世界域中，SimVLM准确率达95.5%，VLMFP生成的有效计划达70.0%。

Conclusion: VLMFP提升了视觉规划的泛化能力和自主性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:

Result: 仿真结果显示该框架在各种干扰场景下具有优越的BER性能。

Conclusion: 提出的抗干扰框架在动态和未知干扰环境中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming communication framework for
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under jamming
attacks. To this end, we first develop an anti-jamming modulation scheme that
uses a spreading matrix to distribute each symbol across multiple subcarriers,
enhancing robustness against jamming. For optimal demodulation at a receiver,
we devise a maximum likelihood detection (MLD) method and its low-complexity
variant tailored to our anti-jamming modulation scheme in scenarios with known
jamming variance. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) of our modulation scheme
to optimize its modulation order according to a jamming scenario. To adapt to
dynamic and unknown jamming environments, we present a jamming-adaptive
communication framework consisting of two phases: (i) a jamming-noncoherent
phase and (ii) a jamming-coherent phase. In the jamming-noncoherent phase, we
develop an approximate MLD method that operates without prior knowledge of
jamming variance and enables the estimation of jamming parameters. In the
jamming-coherent phase, we use these estimated parameters to optimize the

### [45] [An Encoder-Decoder Network for Beamforming over Sparse Large-Scale MIMO Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02355)
*Yubo Zhang,Jeremy Johnston,Xiaodong Wang*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端的深度学习框架，用于大规模稀疏MIMO信道中的下行波束成形，核心是基于深度EDN架构的三个模块。

Conclusion: 提出的EDN波束成形框架在大规模稀疏MIMO系统中具有广泛适用性和有效性。

Abstract: We develop an end-to-end deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in
large-scale sparse MIMO channels. The core is a deep EDN architecture with
three modules: (i) an encoder NN, deployed at each user end, that compresses
estimated downlink channels into low-dimensional latent vectors. The latent
vector from each user is compressed and then fed back to the BS. (ii) a
beamformer decoder NN at the BS that maps recovered latent vectors to
beamformers, and (iii) a channel decoder NN at the BS that reconstructs
downlink channels from recovered latent vectors to further refine the
beamformers. The training of EDN leverages two key strategies: (a)
semi-amortized learning, where the beamformer decoder NN contains an analytical
gradient ascent during both training and inference stages, and (b) knowledge
distillation, where the loss function consists of a supervised term and an
unsupervised term, and starting from supervised training with MMSE beamformers,
over the epochs, the model training gradually shifts toward unsupervised using
the sum-rate objective. The proposed EDN beamforming framework is extended to
both far-field and near-field hybrid beamforming scenarios. Extensive
simulations validate its effectiveness under diverse network and channel
conditions.

Conclusion: 论文填补了处理固定通信延迟的空白，为分布式优化提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed optimization finds applications in large-scale machine learning,
data processing and classification over multi-agent networks. In real-world
scenarios, the communication network of agents may encounter latency that may
affect the convergence of the optimization protocol. This paper addresses the
case where the information exchange among the agents (computing nodes) over
data-transmission channels (links) might be subject to communication
time-delays, which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Our
proposed algorithm improves the state-of-the-art by handling heterogeneous and
arbitrary but bounded and fixed (time-invariant) delays over general
strongly-connected directed networks. Arguments from matrix theory, algebraic
graph theory, and augmented consensus formulation are applied to prove the
convergence to the optimal value. Simulations are provided to verify the
results and compare the performance with some existing delay-free algorithms.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文研究了自适应巡航控制系统（ACC）在电动车（EV）和内燃机车（ICE）中的网络攻击韧性差异，揭示了EV车队的稳定性优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACC在EV和ICE中的广泛使用增加了网络攻击的风险，但两者动力系统对控制输入的响应不同，其网络韧性尚未量化。

Method: 通过形式化六种新型消息级攻击向量，并在环形道路模拟中系统变化ACC市场渗透率和受攻击车辆的分布模式，量化风险。

Result: 在所有模拟场景中，EV车队表现出更低的速度标准差、更小的间距振荡和更快的攻击后恢复速度，展示了稳定性优势。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了控制器与动力系统耦合如何影响脆弱性，并为混合自动驾驶交通中的攻击检测与缓解提供了量化指导。

Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is rapidly proliferating across electric
vehicles (EVs) and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, enhancing traffic
flow while simultaneously expanding the attack surface for communication-based
cyberattacks. Because the two powertrains translate control inputs into motion
differently, their cyber-resilience remains unquantified. Therefore, we
formalize six novel message-level attack vectors and implement them in a
ring-road simulation that systematically varies the ACC market penetration
rates (MPRs) and the spatial pattern of compromised vehicles. A three-tier risk
taxonomy converts disturbance metrics into actionable defense priorities for
practitioners. Across all simulation scenarios, EV platoons exhibit lower
velocity standard deviation, reduced spacing oscillations, and faster
post-attack recovery compared to ICE counterparts, revealing an inherent
stability advantage. These findings clarify how controller-to-powertrain
coupling influences vulnerability and offer quantitative guidance for the
detection and mitigation of attacks in mixed automated traffic.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种周期性事件触发的自适应屏障控制策略，用于解决受扰动的欧拉-拉格朗日系统的轨迹跟踪问题，具有状态、输入和时间约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要连续实时控制动作，而本文旨在通过周期性评估触发条件减少计算负担，同时确保跟踪误差在预定时间内收敛并抑制外部扰动。

Method: 设计了无近似的自适应屏障控制架构，结合时间变阈值函数减少触发次数，并通过分析滤波跟踪误差性能退化得出监测周期的上限。

Result: 提出的控制器避免了Zeno行为且无需连续监测触发条件，仿真和实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该策略在保证控制性能的同时，降低了计算复杂度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This article proposes a periodic event-triggered adaptive barrier control
policy for the trajectory tracking problem of perturbed Euler-Lagrangian
systems with state, input, and temporal (SIT) constraints. In particular, an
approximation-free adaptive-barrier control architecture is designed to ensure
prescribed-time convergence of the tracking error to a prescribed bound while
rejecting exogenous disturbances. In contrast to existing approaches that
necessitate continuous real-time control action, the proposed controller
generates event-based updates through periodic evaluation of the triggering
condition. Additionally, we derive an upper bound on the monitoring period by
analysing the performance degradation of the filtered tracking error to
facilitate periodic evaluation of the event-triggered strategy. To this end, a
time-varying threshold function is considered in the triggering mechanism to
reduce the number of triggers during the transient phase of system behaviour.
Notably, the proposed design avoids Zeno behaviour and precludes the need for
continuous monitoring of the triggering condition. A simulation and
experimental study is undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
control scheme.

Conclusion: DiD-L和SANM方法有效解决了高维特征下的欠拟合问题，为复杂动态系统的几何控制提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Quadrotor stability under complex dynamic disturbances and model
uncertainties poses significant challenges. One of them remains the
underfitting problem in high-dimensional features, which limits the
identification capability of current learning-based methods. To address this,
we introduce a new perspective: Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L), from
which we develop the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM) approach for
geometric control. Specifically, the high-dimensional mapping for
identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings
(``slices"). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is decomposed
into a set of simple low-dimensional tasks addressed by shallow neural networks
and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online
via Lyapunov-based adaptation without any pre-training or persistent excitation
(PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we
prove that the full-state closed-loop system exhibits arbitrarily close to
exponential stability despite multi-dimensional time-varying disturbances and
model uncertainties. This result is novel as it demonstrates exponential
convergence without requiring pre-training for unknown disturbances and
specific knowledge of the model.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息论与估计理论的新型距离度量IEM，适用于复杂信号分布，并在图像质量评估中表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的距离度量（如Mahalanobis距离）在处理复杂信号分布时表现不足，需要一种更适应分布几何的全局和局部度量方法。

Method: 通过比较信号在最优去噪器下的误差向量，定义IEM；推导其全局和局部性质，并用学习到的去噪器实际计算。

Result: 在ImageNet数据库上学习的IEM，能媲美或超越当前先进的监督图像质量指标。

Conclusion: IEM提供了一种灵活且高效的信号距离度量方法，适用于复杂分布，并在实践中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of
distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density
over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship
between information theory and estimation theory, which links the
log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to
noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of
signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of
noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector
fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels.
We prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form
expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian
metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the
Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both
locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM
can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion
models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our
framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this
IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image
quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset of Visible and Near-Infrared
(VNIR) hyperspectral imagery acquired via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
platform for landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection research. The
dataset was collected over a controlled test field seeded with 143 realistic
surrogate landmine and UXO targets, including surface, partially buried, and
fully buried configurations. Data acquisition was performed using a Headwall
Nano-Hyperspec sensor mounted on a multi-sensor drone platform, flown at an
altitude of approximately 20.6 m, capturing 270 contiguous spectral bands
spanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and
mosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point
Empirical Line Method (ELM), with reference spectra acquired using an SVC
spectroradiometer. Cross-validation against six reference objects yielded RMSE
values below 1.0 and SAM values between 1 and 6 degrees in the 400-900 nm
range, demonstrating high spectral fidelity. The dataset is released alongside
raw radiance cubes, GCP/AeroPoint data, and reference spectra to support
reproducible research. This contribution fills a critical gap in open-access
UAV-based hyperspectral data for landmine detection and offers a multi-sensor
benchmark when combined with previously published drone-based electromagnetic
induction (EMI) data from the same test field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低地球轨道卫星和无人机在IoT应用中的普及，非地面网络面临覆盖范围大导致碰撞和移动网关导致链路动态变化的挑战。现有随机接入协议（如ALOHA、CSMA、BSMA）在这些场景下表现不佳。

Method: 提出了Free Signal Multiple Access (FSMA)协议，引入FreeChirp信号，确保节点仅在信道空闲且链路可靠时传输，无需同步或复杂调度。

Result: 实验证明，FSMA在吞吐量、包接收率和能效上分别提升了2倍、2-5倍和5倍；大规模仿真显示其可支持5000+设备。

Conclusion: FSMA为实现可扩展、高能效和可靠的非地面网络IoT提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for universal IoT
applications and the growing use of drones in emergency services, agriculture,
and military operations highlight the transformative potential of
non-terrestrial networks (NTN). However, these networks face two key
challenges: (1) large coverage footprints that create frequent collisions and
(2) moving gateways that cause dynamic links and demand synchronization-free,
link-aware transmissions. Existing random access schemes such as ALOHA, CSMA,
and BSMA fail in this setting, suffering from high collision rates, hidden
terminals, or excessive gateway energy overhead. We propose Free Signal
Multiple Access (FSMA), a gateway-controlled protocol that introduces a
lightweight free signal chirp (FreeChirp). FreeChirp ensures that nodes
transmit only when the channel is idle and when links are reliable, thereby
reducing collisions and enabling link-aware access without the need for
synchronization or complex scheduling. We evaluate FSMA using 25 commercial
LoRa devices with a drone-mounted moving gateway and demonstrate up to 2x
higher throughput, 2x to 5x better packet reception ratio, and 5x improved
energy efficiency compared to the baselines. Large-scale simulations with a
custom Satellite IoT Simulator further show that FSMA scales to 5000+ devices
per satellite pass. These results establish FSMA as a practical step toward
scalable, energy-efficient, and reliable NTN IoT networks.

Result: VERNIER软件表现出对噪声、失焦和遮挡的高度鲁棒性，并提供了设计选择和显微镜镜头的指南。

Conclusion: VERNIER为小尺度姿态估计提供了高效解决方案，适用于多种显微镜应用场景。

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

TL;DR: Mask2IV是一个新颖的交互中心视频生成框架，通过解耦的两阶段流程预测动作和物体轨迹，无需密集掩码输入，提升了生成质量和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交互中心视频对机器人学习和操作策略训练至关重要，但现有方法难以建模复杂动态交互，且密集掩码标注难以获取。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：先预测动作与物体轨迹，再基于轨迹生成视频，支持通过动作描述或空间位置引导交互过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Mask2IV在视觉真实性和可控性上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Mask2IV无需密集掩码输入，显著提升了交互中心视频的生成质量和用户控制灵活性。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于欧氏距离矩阵（EDM）和Gram矩阵特性的多声源位置和到达方向（DOA）估计新方法，显著降低了计算成本并提高了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SRP方法在多声源位置和DOA估计中需要优化多个连续变量，计算成本高，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 利用EDM和Gram矩阵特性，位置估计仅需优化一个连续变量（距离），DOA估计则完全避免连续变量优化。通过最小化成本函数（基于Gram矩阵特征值）确定最优解。

Result: 实验表明，EDM方法在计算成本和估计精度上均优于SRP方法，尤其在两源场景中表现更佳。

Conclusion: EDM方法显著提升了多声源位置和DOA估计的效率与准确性，适用于不同声源和麦克风配置。

Abstract: A popular method to estimate the positions or directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of
multiple sound sources using an array of microphones is based on
steered-response power (SRP) beamforming. For a three-dimensional scenario,
SRP-based methods need to jointly optimize three continuous variables for
position estimation or two continuous variables for DOA estimation, which can
be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose novel methods for
multi-source position and DOA estimation by exploiting properties of Euclidean
distance matrices (EDMs) and their respective Gram matrices. In the proposed
multi-source position estimation method only a single continuous variable,
representing the distance between each source and a reference microphone, needs
to be optimized. For each source, the optimal continuous distance variable and
set of candidate time-difference of arrival (TDOA) estimates are determined by
minimizing a cost function that is defined using the eigenvalues of the Gram
matrix. The estimated relative source positions are then mapped to estimated
absolute source positions by solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem for each
source. The proposed multi-source DOA estimation method entirely eliminates the
need for continuous variable optimization by defining a relative coordinate
system per source such that one of its coordinate axes is aligned with the
respective source DOA. The optimal set of candidate TDOA estimates is
determined by minimizing a cost function that is defined using the eigenvalues
of a rank-reduced Gram matrix. The computational cost of the proposed EDM-based
methods is significantly reduced compared to the SRP-based methods.
Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations show
that the proposed EDM-based method consistently outperforms the SRP-based
method in terms of two-source position and DOA estimation accuracy.
