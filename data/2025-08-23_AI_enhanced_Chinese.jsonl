Among these, quadruped robots with\nmanipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.\nHowever, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of\nintegrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic\narm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.\nTeleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high\nlevel of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load\non the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that\ndirectly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler\nand more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by\nleveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external\ncamera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist\nposition. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to\ncontrol the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe\nteleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and\nthe robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,\ndemonstrating robust performance in real-time control.

To investigate their capabilities, we\nstudy the sum rate maximization problem in an SIM-based multiuser (MU)\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system. A vast majority of pioneer\nstudies, if not all, address this fundamental problem using the prevailing\nalternating optimization (AO) framework, where the digital beamforming (DB) and\nSIM phase shifts are optimized alternately.

To this end, we provide practical design\nguidelines to improve AO-based optimization of digital precoders and SIM phase\nshifts. Specifically, we show that (i) optimizing the SIM phase shifts first\nyields significant performance improvements, compared to optimizing the DB\nfirst; and (ii) when applying projected gradient (PG) methods, which are\ngradually becoming more popular to optimize the phase shifts thanks to their\nscalability, we find that using an iterative PG method achieves better\nperformance than the single PG step, which is commonly used in existing\nsolutions.

In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with\npre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation\nintroduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,\ncomplex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an\niterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict\nadjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show\nacross several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing\nin-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.\nVideo summary of this work and experiments can be found\nhttps://youtu.be/2inxpdrq74U?si=dAdDYsUEr25nZvRn.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It provides an\naccessible way for controlling the interaction between electromagnetic waves\nwith the propagation medium. One particularly important aspect is the\nconfiguration of the RIS elements or reflectors. Simply stated, the objective\nof the RIS configuration is to choose the optimum phase-shift combination that\nmaximizes the channel capacity. Recently, neural networks (NNs) were proposed\nfor tackling this task and results have shown that the proposed NN promotes far\nless reconfigurations of the RIS, consequently reducing the configuration\noverhead. Beyond that, the RIS can be repurposed for tackling the Doppler shift\nin high-mobility communication systems. Despite not being its usual primary\ngoal, results have also demonstrated that the RIS can compensate for the\nDoppler shift at a small cost in performance.

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range\nof challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can\nalready noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional\nsupervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical\npoints in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes\nleads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches.
