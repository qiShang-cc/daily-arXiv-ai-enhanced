This study addresses these\nchallenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework\ntailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled (PL) target datasets.\nUnlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the proposed\nMOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously.\nFurthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures\napplicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based\ndesigns-for compound fault diagnosis under PL conditions. Based on this\ninvestigation, we propose a novel cross-talk layer structure that enables\nselective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing\nclassification performance in compound fault scenarios.

This issue leaves the multi-band RARE as a black box, posing\nchallenges in its practical C&S applications. To fill in this gap, this paper\ninvestigates the underlying mechanism of multi-band RAREs and explores their\noptimal performance. For the first time, the closed-form expression of the\ntransfer function of a multi-band RARE is derived by solving the quantum\nresponse of Rydberg atoms excited by multi-band signals. The function reveals\nthat a multiband RARE simultaneously serves as both a multi-band atomic mixer\nfor down-converting multi-band signals and a multi-band atomic amplifier that\nreflects its sensitivity to each band. Further analysis of the atomic amplifier\nunveils that the gain factor at each frequency band can be decoupled into a\nglobal gain term and a Rabi attention term. The former determines the overall\nsensitivity of a RARE to all frequency bands of wireless signals. The latter\ninfluences the allocation of the overall sensitivity to each frequency band,\nrepresenting a unique attention mechanism of multi-band RAREs. The optimal\ndesign of the global gain is provided to maximize the overall sensitivity of\nmulti-band RAREs.

In this paper, we propose the cognitive radio (CR)\nfunctionality for STAR-RIS-assisted CR-RSMA systems, leveraging the unique\ncapability of the STAR-RIS to combine element and power splitting for adaptive\ncontrol of transmission and reflection in CR scenarios. Specifically, the\nproposed CR functionality partitions the STAR-RIS into two regions\nindependently controlling the transmission and reflection of signals,\nsimultaneously ensuring the required QoS for the primary user and enhancing the\nperformance of the secondary user. To accurately characterize the system\nperformance, we derive analytical expressions for the ergodic rate of the\nsecondary user and the outage rate of the primary user under Nakagami-m fading.\nFinally, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively manages\ninterference, guarantees the QoS of the primary user, and significantly\nimproves the throughput of the secondary user, highlighting STAR-RIS as an\nefficient solution for CR-RSMA-based services."}

The goal is to enable each sensor to recover\nits observable sparse signal when measurements are corrupted by outliers. To\nachieve reliable local signal recovery with limited data access, we propose a\ndistributed reconstruction algorithm that enables collaboration among sensor\ndevices without the need to share individual raw data. The proposed scheme\nemploys a two-stage approach that first recovers the amplitude of the global\nsignal (at a central server) and subsequently estimates the observable nonzero\nsignal entries (at each local device). Our analytic results show that perfect\nglobal signal amplitude recovery can be achieved under mild conditions on the\nsupport size of sparse outliers and the view blockage level. In addition, the\nexact reconstruction of locally observed signal components is shown to be\nattainable in the noise-free case by solving a binary optimization problem,\nsubject to a mild requirement on the structure of the sensing matrix. Computer\nsimulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nscheme."}

By\nseparating and controlling the support recovery process through statistical\nKnockoff filters, our framework achieves more accurate signal reconstruction,\nespecially in challenging scenarios where traditional methods fail. We\nestablish theoretical guarantees demonstrating how FDR control directly ensures\nrecovery performance under weaker conditions than traditional $\\ell_1$-based\ncompressive sensing methods, while maintaining accurate signal reconstruction.\nExtensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed Knockoff-based\nmethod consistently outperforms LASSO-based and other state-of-the-art\ncompressive sensing techniques. In simulation studies, our method improves\nF1-score by up to 3.9x over baseline methods, attributed to principled false\ndiscovery rate (FDR) control and enhanced support recovery. The method also\nconsistently yields lower reconstruction and relative errors. We further\nvalidate the framework on real-world datasets, where it achieves top downstream\npredictive performance across both regression and classification tasks, often\nnarrowing or even surpassing the performance gap relative to uncompressed\nsignals. These results establish \\TheName{} as a robust and practical\nalternative to existing approaches, offering both theoretical guarantees and\nstrong empirical performance through statistically grounded support selection."}

In particular, we propose to estimate an optimal shrinkage coefficient\nby setting $\\alpha$ as the solution to a suitably chosen objective function;\nnamely the leave-one-out cross-validated (LOOCV) log-likelihood loss. Since\nLOOCV is computationally prohibitive even for moderate sample size $n$, we\npropose a computationally efficient approximation for the LOOCV log-likelihood\nloss that eliminates the need for invoking the RTME procedure $n$ times for\neach sample left out during the LOOCV procedure. This approximation yields an\n$O(n)$ reduction in the running time complexity for the LOOCV procedure, which\nresults in a significant speedup for computing the LOOCV estimate. We\ndemonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic\nhigh-dimensional data sampled from heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, as\nwell as on real high-dimensional datasets for object recognition, face\nrecognition, and handwritten digit's recognition.
