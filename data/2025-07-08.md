*Naimahmed Nesaragi,Hemin Ali Qadir,Per Steiner Halvorsen,Ilangko Balasingham*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Biaxialformer是一种新型Transformer模型，用于EEG信号解码，通过两阶段注意机制同时捕捉时空信息，解决了传统CI模型忽略通道间相关性的问题，在神经系统预后预测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Transformer的通道独立模型在多通道EEG信号分析中忽略了通道间相关性，导致信息丢失和预测准确性下降，尤其在复杂任务（如神经系统预后预测）中表现不足。

Method: 提出Biaxialformer，包含两阶段注意机制：独立提取时间和空间信息，结合位置编码联合学习，利用双极EEG信号增强空间特征提取，并通过可变感受野的token化模块平衡局部与全局特征。

Result: 在五家医院的多中心I-CARE数据上验证，Biaxialformer在跨医院场景中平均AUC为0.7688，AUPRC为0.8643，F1为0.6518，表现出强鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Biaxialformer通过兼顾时空信息解决了传统模型的局限性，为神经系统预后预测提供了高效工具，拓宽了Transformer在EEG分析中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate decoding of EEG signals requires comprehensive modeling of both
temporal dynamics within individual channels and spatial dependencies across
channels. While Transformer-based models utilizing channel-independence (CI)
strategies have demonstrated strong performance in various time series tasks,
they often overlook the inter-channel correlations that are critical in
multivariate EEG signals. This omission can lead to information degradation and
reduced prediction accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as neurological
outcome prediction. To address these challenges, we propose Biaxialformer,
characterized by a meticulously engineered two-stage attention-based framework.
This model independently captures both sequence-specific (temporal) and
channel-specific (spatial) EEG information, promoting synergy and mutual
reinforcement across channels without sacrificing CI. By employing joint
learning of positional encodings, Biaxialformer preserves both temporal and
spatial relationships in EEG data, mitigating the interchannel correlation
forgetting problem common in traditional CI models. Additionally, a
tokenization module with variable receptive fields balance the extraction of
fine-grained, localized features and broader temporal dependencies. To enhance
spatial feature extraction, we leverage bipolar EEG signals, which capture
inter-hemispheric brain interactions, a critical but often overlooked aspect in
EEG analysis. Our study broadens the use of Transformer-based models by
addressing the challenge of predicting neurological outcomes in comatose
patients. Using the multicenter I-CARE data from five hospitals, we validate
the robustness and generalizability of Biaxialformer with an average AUC
0.7688, AUPRC 0.8643, and F1 0.6518 in a cross-hospital scenario.

*Gerald Enzner,Niklas Knaepper,Aleksej Chinaev*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文评估了不同神经网络模型在自干扰建模中的性能，发现Hammerstein模型在参数较少的情况下表现良好，并提出新的Wiener-Hammerstein模型进一步提升了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是通过合成和真实数据评估和交叉比较不同来源的神经网络自干扰模型，验证模型在未专门设计的数据上的表现。

Method: 使用合成数据和真实数据，对现有的神经网络自干扰模型进行交叉比较。

Result: Hammerstein模型在参数较少的情况下表现良好，新的Wiener-Hammerstein模型进一步提升了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的Wiener-Hammerstein模型在自干扰建模中具有更好的泛化能力，且Hammerstein模型是一个高效的候选方案。

Abstract: Inband full-duplex communication requires accurate modeling and cancellation
of self-interference, specifically in the digital domain. Neural networks are
presently candidate models for capturing nonlinearity of the self-interference
path. This work utilizes synthetic and real data from different sources to
evaluate and cross-compare performances of previously proposed neural
self-interference models from different sources. The relevance of the analysis
consists in the mutual assessment of methods on data they were not specifically
designed for. We find that our previously proposed Hammerstein model represents
the range of data sets well, while being significantly smaller in terms of the
number of parameters. A new Wiener-Hammerstein model further enhances the
generalization performance.

### [3] [Enhancing Satellite Quantum Key Distribution with Dual Band Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03246)
*Muhammad Khalil,Ke Wang,Jinho Choi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型混合卫星通信系统架构，通过可重构智能表面（RIS）集成了量子密钥分发（QKD）和经典射频（RF）数据传输，旨在提供全球性、安全和可靠的通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足全球通信对安全性和可靠性的需求，结合量子光学链路的安全性和经典射频信道的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用频率选择性RIS实时优化量子（850 nm）和经典（S波段）信道，并通过QUBO问题联合优化量子比特误码率（QBER）和经典信噪比（SNR）。

Result: 实验和仿真结果显示，RIS辅助系统将QBER从2.5%降至0.7%，安全密钥速率（SKR）提升至每秒30,000比特以上，经典RF SNR在高仰角时增加约3 dB。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了混合RIS辅助卫星链路在实现高效、安全和稳健的全球通信方面的实际潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel system architecture for hybrid satellite
communications, integrating quantum key distribution (QKD) and classical radio
frequency (RF) data transmission using a dual-band reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS). The motivation is to address the growing need for global,
secure, and reliable communications by leveraging the security of quantum
optical links and the robustness of classical RF channels within a unified
framework. By employing a frequency-selective RIS, the system independently
optimizes both quantum (850 nm) and classical (S-band) channels in real time,
dynamically adapting to environmental fluctuations such as atmospheric
turbulence and rain attenuation. The joint optimization of the quantum bit
error rate (QBER) and the classical signal-to noise ratio (SNR) is formulated
as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling
efficient adaptive phase control utilizing both quantum and classical
computational methods. Comprehensive theoretical modeling and simulations,
benchmarked against experimental data from the Micius satellite, demonstrate
substantial performance gains. Notably, the RIS assisted system reduces QBER
from approximately 2.5% to 0.7%, increases the secure key rate (SKR) to over
30,000 bits per second, and enhances classical RF SNR by about 3 dB at high
elevation angles. These results illustrate the practical potential of hybrid
RIS-assisted satellite links to deliver robust, efficient, and secure global
communications.

### [4] [Specific Absorption Rate-Aware Multiuser MIMO Assisted by Fluid Antenna System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03351)
*Yuqi Ye,Li You,Hao Xu,Ahmed Elzanaty,Kai-Kit Wong,Xiqi Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了在第六代（6G）无线网络中，通过流体天线系统（FAS）实现多用户MIMO通信时对特定吸收率（SAR）的关注，提出了一种两层次迭代算法来在满足信噪比和FAS约束下最小化SAR值，并通过仿真验证了其优于传统方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G网络的发展，需要新技术满足更高的性能指标。FAS通过动态调整天线位置以改善信道，但同时也引发了电磁辐射（SAR）的担忧。因此，研究如何在FAS辅助的多用户MIMO通信中降低SAR值具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了一种两层次迭代算法，用于在满足信号干扰噪声比（SINR）和FAS约束的条件下最小化SAR值，并研究了最小加权SINR最大化问题及其与SAR最小化问题的关系。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的SAR感知FAS设计在降低SAR的同时，性能优于自适应退避和固定位置天线设计。

Conclusion: SAR感知的FAS设计能有效平衡性能与电磁辐射安全，为6G网络中的多用户MIMO通信提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: With the development of the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks,
there is a pressing need for innovative technologies capable of satisfying
heightened performance indicators. Fluid antenna system (FAS) is proposed
recently as a promising technique to achieve higher data rates and more
diversity gains by dynamically changing the positions of the antennas to form a
more desirable channel. However, worries regarding the possibly harmful effects
of electromagnetic (EM) radiation emitted by devices have arisen as a result of
the rapid evolution of advanced techniques in wireless communication systems.
Specific absorption rate (SAR) is a widely adopted metric to quantify EM
radiation worldwide. In this paper, we investigate the SAR-aware multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications assisted by FAS. In
particular, a two-layer iterative algorithm is proposed to minimize the SAR
value under signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and FAS constraints.
Moreover, the minimum weighted SINR maximization problem under SAR and FAS
constraints is studied by finding its relationship with the SAR minimization
problem. Simulation results verify that the proposed SAR-aware FAS design
outperforms the adaptive backoff and fixed-position antenna designs.

### [5] [UWB TDoA Error Correction using Transformers: Patching and Positional Encoding Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03523)
*Dieter Coppens,Adnan Shahid,Eli De Poorter*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Transformer的TDoA位置校正方法，利用原始信道脉冲响应（CIR）在复杂NLOS环境中提升定位精度，实验显示比基线方法提升73.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UWB定位系统在工业多障碍环境下因多径效应和NLOS条件导致精度下降，现有方法通常排除NLOS链路，但会引发几何精度稀释问题且不适用于多数链路为NLOS的场景。

Method: 提出一种基于Transformer的TDoA位置校正方法，通过所有可用锚节点的原始CIR数据计算位置校正，并引入多种CIR排序、分块和位置编码策略。

Result: 在真实UWB测量实验中，该方法在几乎全为NLOS信号的复杂环境中实现0.39米精度，相比TDoA基线提升73.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法在NLOS主导环境中显著提升定位精度，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Despite their high accuracy, UWB-based localization systems suffer
inaccuracies when deployed in industrial locations with many obstacles due to
multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. In such
environments, current error mitigation approaches for time difference of
arrival (TDoA) localization typically exclude NLOS links. However, this
exclusion approach leads to geometric dilution of precision problems and this
approach is infeasible when the majority of links are NLOS. To address these
limitations, we propose a transformer-based TDoA position correction method
that uses raw channel impulse responses (CIRs) from all available anchor nodes
to compute position corrections. We introduce different CIR ordering, patching
and positional encoding strategies for the transformer, and analyze each
proposed technique's scalability and performance gains. Based on experiments on
real-world UWB measurements, our approach can provide accuracies of up to 0.39
m in a complex environment consisting of (almost) only NLOS signals, which is
an improvement of 73.6 % compared to the TDoA baseline.

### [6] [Implicit Neural Representation of Beamforming for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA) System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03609)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的连续孔径阵列（CAPA）系统下行波束成形优化方法，使用DNN（BeaINR）参数化波束成形函数，并发现最优波束成形函数处于信道函数的子空间中，提出另一种DNN（CoefINR）学习加权系数以减少复杂度。仿真结果显示，所提方法在频谱效率和推理时间上优于数值基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化CAPA系统中的下行波束成形，解决传统方法在高维函数映射中的复杂性问题。

Method: 提出BeaINR DNN参数化波束成形函数，并基于最优波束成形函数处于信道函数子空间的发现，提出CoefINR DNN学习加权系数以降低复杂度。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法在频谱效率和推理时间上优于数值基线，且CoefINR具有更高的训练效率。

Conclusion: 基于INR的DNN方法为CAPA系统中的波束成形优化提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, a learning-based approach for optimizing downlink beamforming
in continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems is proposed, where a MIMO scenario
that both the base station (BS) and the user are equipped with CAPA is
considered. As the beamforming in the CAPA system is a function that maps a
coordinate on the aperture to the beamforming weight at the coordinate, a DNN
called BeaINR is proposed to parameterize this function, which is called
implicit neural representation (INR). We further find that the optimal
beamforming function lies in the subspace of channel function, i.e., it can be
expressed as a weighted integral of channel function. Based on this finding, we
propose another DNN called CoefINR to learn the weighting coefficient with INR,
which has lower complexity than learning the beamforming function with BeaINR.
Simulation results show that the proposed INR-based methods outperform
numerical baselines in both spectral efficiency (SE) and inference time, with
CoefINR offering additional training efficiency.

*Daniel D. Stancil*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用多径传播而非抑制多径的天线方向图测量方法（MEAP），类似于MIMO系统，无需消声环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统天线方向图测量需要抑制多径传播，而MEAP技术旨在利用多径传播，减少对消声环境的依赖。

Method: 通过参考天线测量校准多径信道矩阵，并使用向量球谐函数高效表示方向图。

Result: 数值计算验证了方法的可行性，实验成果在另一篇论文中展示。

Conclusion: MEAP技术为天线方向图测量提供了一种无需消声环境的新方法，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Traditional antenna pattern measurements involve minimizing the impact of
multipath propagation in the measurement environment. In contrast, this work
introduces a measurement approach that uses rather than mitigates multipath
propagation. This is referred to as the Multipath-Enhanced Antenna Pattern
(MEAP) Measurement technique. In this respect the approach has some kinship
with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. The advantage in the case
of MIMO systems is increased capacity; in the MEAP approach the advantage is
elimination of the need for creating an anechoic environment. The approach uses
measurements with reference antennas to calibrate the multipath channel matrix,
and vector spherical harmonics for efficient pattern representation. After
presenting the mathematical details of the method, numerical calculations
illustrating the approach are presented. Experimental results are described in
a companion paper.

Motivation: 验证在典型多径环境（如家庭车库）中利用多径特性进行天线模式测量的可行性。

Method: 使用半波长电偶极子作为校准和测试天线，并采用三种分析方法：基于三个感知天线的矩阵反演法、最小二乘误差技术及带功率约束的最小二乘误差技术。

Result: 带功率约束的最小二乘误差技术在10个感知天线的测量数据下表现最优。

Conclusion: 实验证实了利用多径环境进行天线模式测量的可行性，且带约束的最小二乘误差技术为最佳分析方法。

Abstract: In a companion paper we presented the theory for an antenna pattern measuring
technique that uses (rather than mitigates) the properties of a multipath
environment. Here we use measurements in a typical home garage to
experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the technique. A half-wavelength
electric dipole with different orientations was used as both the calibration
and test antennas. For simplicity, we limited the modeling of the antenna
pattern to using only the three $l=1$ vector spherical harmonics. Three methods
were used to analyze the measurements: a matrix inversion method using only 3
sense antennas, a least-square-error technique, and a least-square-error
technique with a constant power constraint imposed. The two least-square-error
techniques used the measurements from 10 sense antennas. The constrained
least-square-error technique was found to give the best results.

Motivation: 旨在解决太赫兹频段通信系统中，由于线性零迫检测导致的符号错误率分析不准确问题。

Method: 1) 在独立信道和噪声条件下，推导失配SER；2) 在相关条件下，使用copula方法建模依赖性并推导精确SER；3) 针对硬件损伤导致的噪声相关性评估SER。

Result: 仿真表明，该框架能够修正信道-噪声独立性假设导致的多dB SER误差。

Conclusion: 提出的综合分析框架显著提高了太赫兹通信系统符号错误率的准确性，为实际系统设计提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive symbol error rate (SER) analysis framework for
link-level terahertz (THz)-band communication systems under linear zero-forcing
(ZF) data detection. First, we derive the mismatched SER for indoor THz systems
under independent channel and noise assumptions, calculating the probability
density function of the ratio of Gaussian noise to $\alpha$-$\mu$ channels
resulting from ZF filtering. Next, we derive the precise SER under correlated
channel and noise conditions, modeling dependencies using the copula method.
Finally, we evaluate the SER for THz channels with correlated distortion noise
from hardware impairments. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework
corrects for multi-dB SERs resulting from the channel-noise independence
assumption.

### [10] [Improving SAGIN Resilience to Jamming with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03729)
*Leila Marandi,Khaled Humadi,Gunes Karabulut Kurt,Wessam Ajib,Wei-Ping Zhu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在抗干扰的空地一体化网络中使用RIS优化信号与干扰加噪声比（SJNR）的方法，通过将RIS部署在固定无人机上以对抗恶意干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未充分考虑LEO卫星在GEO卫星干扰下的信号传输问题，因此提出了一种新的优化方法以提高信号质量。

Method: 采用交替优化（AO）和半定松弛（SDR）技术，优化RIS波束成形和LEO卫星的发射功率，假设RIS具备全局信道状态信息（CSI）。

Result: 仿真结果显示优化方案显著提升了性能，同时表明在干扰功率高且RIS单元较少时，将RIS部署在用户附近的无人机上更有效。

Conclusion: 通过RIS优化和合理部署，可以有效提升SAGIN的抗干扰能力，尤其是在高干扰环境下。

Abstract: This study investigates the anti-jamming space-air-ground integrated network
(SAGIN) scenario wherein a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed
on a fixed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to counteract malevolent jamming
attacks. In contrast to existing research, in this paper, we consider that a
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite is sending the signal to the user on the ground
in the presence of jamming from a Geostationary Equatorial Orbit (GEO)
satellite side. We aim to maximize the signal-to-jamming plus noise ratio
(SJNR) by optimizing the RIS beamforming and transmit power of the LEO
satellite. Assuming the availability of global channel state information (CSI)
at the RIS, we propose alternating optimization (AO) and semidefinite
relaxation (SDR) techniques to address the complexity. Simulation results show
that the optimization schemes lead to considerable performance improvements.
The results also indicate that, given the high jamming power and the relatively
small number of RIS elements, deploying the RIS on UAVs near the user is more
effective in mitigating the impact of jamming interferers.

*Rayan Salmi,Guorui Lu,Qinyu Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SHAP-AAD通过结合DeepSHAP和轻量TCN，减少EEG通道数量，保持高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG听觉注意力检测方法依赖过多电极影响佩戴舒适度，SHAP-AAD旨在减少通道数量。

Method: 两阶段框架：DeepSHAP选择重要通道，轻量TCN进行高效检测。

Result: 32通道与64通道效果相近（79.21% vs. 81.06%），8通道也能满足需求。

Conclusion: SHAP-AAD成功降低复杂度并保持性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based auditory attention detection (AAD) offers
a non-invasive way to enhance hearing aids, but conventional methods rely on
too many electrodes, limiting wearability and comfort. This paper presents
SHAP-AAD, a two-stage framework that combines DeepSHAP-based channel selection
with a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) for efficient AAD using
fewer channels.DeepSHAP, an explainable AI technique, is applied to a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on topographic alpha-power maps to
rank channel importance, and the top-k EEG channels are used to train a compact
TCN. Experiments on the DTU dataset show that using 32 channels yields
comparable accuracy to the full 64-channel setup (79.21% vs. 81.06%) on
average. In some cases, even 8 channels can deliver satisfactory accuracy.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SHAP-AAD in reducing complexity
while preserving high detection performance.

### [12] [Robust Node Localization for Rough and Extreme Deployment Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03856)
*Abiy Tasissa,Waltenegus Dargie*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于压缩感知的方法，用于在恶劣环境下识别易受干扰的节点并稳健估计其位置，同时设计了最优锚点配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于恶劣环境（如强干扰、极端天气等）导致无线链路质量下降，定位任务中目标节点的位置估计误差较大，因此需要解决节点识别和稳健定位问题。

Method: 将问题建模为压缩感知问题，提出节点识别和稳健位置估计算法，并设计最优锚点配置以最大化定位鲁棒性。

Result: 数值结果显示，所提算法能以较少锚点实现稳健定位，且仅需目标到锚点的距离信息。

Conclusion: 该方法适用性广，能在恶劣环境下实现稳健定位。

Abstract: Many applications have been identified which require the deployment of
large-scale low-power wireless sensor networks. Some of the deployment
environments, however, impose harsh operation conditions due to intense
cross-technology interference, extreme weather conditions (heavy rainfall,
excessive heat, etc.), or rough motion, thereby affecting the quality and
predictability of the wireless links the nodes establish. In localization
tasks, these conditions often lead to significant errors in estimating the
position of target nodes. Motivated by the practical deployments of sensors on
the surface of different water bodies, we address the problem of identifying
susceptible nodes and robustly estimating their positions. We formulate these
tasks as a compressive sensing problem and propose algorithms for both node
identification and robust estimation. Additionally, we design an optimal anchor
configuration to maximize the robustness of the position estimation task. Our
numerical results and comparisons with competitive methods demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms achieve both objectives with a modest number of anchors.
Since our method relies only on target-to-anchor distances, it is broadly
applicable and yields resilient, robust localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的AFDM系统检测方法（如ZF、LMMSE和MPA）在复杂多径信道下表现不佳，需要更高效且鲁棒的检测方案。

Method: 采用变分贝叶斯方法，通过最小化KL散度近似真实后验分布，实现低复杂度的符号概率估计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该检测器具有更低的误码率、更快的收敛速度，且在复杂多径信道下表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和检测性能上均优于传统方法，适用于复杂信道环境。

Abstract: This paper proposes a variational Bayesian (VB) detector for affine frequency
division multiplexing (AFDM) systems. The proposed method estimates the symbol
probability distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between the true posterior and an approximate distribution, thereby enabling
low-complexity soft-decision detection. Compared to conventional approaches
such as zero-forcing (ZF), Linear minimum mean square rrror (LMMSE), and the
message passing algorithm (MPA), the proposed detector demonstrates lower bit
error rates (BER), faster convergence, and improved robustness under complex
multipath channels. Simulation results confirm its dual advantages in
computational efficiency and detection performance.

TL;DR: 论文研究了冷冻电镜（cryo-EM）和冷冻电子断层扫描（cryo-ET）中由确认偏差导致的系统误差，特别是在粒子挑选阶段，即使对纯噪声数据也可能产生虚假分子结构（称为“噪声中的结构”），并提出了缓解策略。

Motivation: 研究动机是解决冷冻电镜和冷冻电子断层扫描中因确认偏差导致的数据解释系统性误差问题，尤其是在粒子挑选阶段。

Method: 方法包括理论分析和控制实验，重点分析模板匹配和深度神经网络两种常用方法在纯噪声数据上的表现。

Result: 结果表明，这两种方法在处理纯噪声时可能产生虚假的分子结构，揭示了当前工作流程中粒子挑选算法可能引入的强烈先验偏差。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁谨慎解释重建结果，尤其是依赖模板驱动的粒子挑选时，并提出了缓解策略以降低此类偏差的影响。

Abstract: Confirmation bias is a fundamental challenge in cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), where prior expectations can
lead to systematic errors in data interpretation. This bias may emerge at
multiple stages of the reconstruction pipeline, and in particular in the
critical particle picking stage, where 2D particles (in cryo-EM) or 3D
subtomograms (in cryo-ET) are extracted from highly noisy micrographs or
tomograms. Focusing on two widely used methodologies, template matching and
deep neural networks, we combine theoretical analysis with controlled
experiments to demonstrate that both methods, when applied to pure noise, can
produce persistent molecular structures, a phenomenon we term structure from
noise. This artifact highlights a critical vulnerability in current workflows:
the potential for particle-picking algorithms to inject strong prior-driven
bias into downstream analyses. We then propose practical mitigation strategies
to reduce the impact of such biases. Together, our findings deepen the
theoretical understanding of confirmation bias in cryo-EM and cryo-ET and call
for cautious interpretation of reconstructions, primarily when relying on
template-driven particle picking.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于潜在碰撞风险动态调整的雷达过滤方法，通过关键性评分和区域划分提升自动驾驶感知系统的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中雷达传感器噪声高，传统严格过滤方法会漏检对象。未来高自动化功能对错误率要求更高，需改进过滤策略。

Method: 设计一种算法，根据车辆计划轨迹为雷达点分配关键性评分，并在高风险区域取消过滤阈值。同时提出一种评估方法，模拟关键场景验证框架。

Result: 关键性评分表现出高召回率，后处理算法在示例中比通用过滤器减少了74.8%的非聚类关键点。

Conclusion: 动态过滤策略能有效平衡误报与漏检，为自动驾驶感知系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Radar sensors play a crucial role for perception systems in automated driving
but suffer from a high level of noise. In the past, this could be solved by
strict filters, which remove most false positives at the expense of undetected
objects. Future highly automated functions are much more demanding with respect
to error rate. Hence, if the radar sensor serves as a component of perception
systems for such functions, a simple filter strategy cannot be applied. In this
paper, we present a modified filtering approach which is characterized by the
idea to vary the filtering depending on the potential of harmful collision with
the object which is potentially represented by the radar point. We propose an
algorithm which determines a criticality score for each point based on the
planned or presumable trajectory of the automated vehicle. Points identified as
very critical can trigger manifold actions to confirm or deny object presence.
Our pipeline introduces criticality regions. The filter threshold in these
criticality regions is omitted. Commonly known radar data sets do not or barely
feature critical scenes. Thus, we present an approach to evaluate our framework
by adapting the planned trajectory towards vulnerable road users, which serve
as ground truth critical points. Evaluation of the criticality metric prove
high recall rates. Besides, our post-processing algorithm lowers the rate of
non-clustered critical points by 74.8 % in an exemplary setup compared to a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于EEG信号的高主体间变异性导致数据漂移，传统方法难以泛化到未见主体，自监督学习和领域适应方法也存在局限性。

Method: MMOC框架训练多个基础模型（基于重建和对比学习策略），并通过损失路由机制动态选择最适合的模型进行推理。

Conclusion: MMOC有效缓解了主体间数据漂移问题，为实际EEG情绪识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) emotion recognition plays a crucial role in
human-computer interaction, particularly in healthcare and neuroscience. While
supervised learning has been widely used, its reliance on manual annotations
introduces high costs and potential bias. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers
a promising alternative by generating labels through pretext tasks. However,
high inter-subject variability in EEG signals leads to significant data drift,
limiting self-supervised models' generalization across unseen subjects.
Traditional domain adaptation (DA) methods require access to target-domain data
during training. Although domain generalization (DG) avoids this constraint, it
often falls short in handling complex data drift due to limited coverage of
possible target distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose MMOC, a
self-supervised framework with multi-model online collaboration (MMOC), to
achieve online adaptation to unseen data. MMOC trains multiple base models
using diverse strategies rooted in reconstruction and contrastive learning,
enabling each model to develop distinct generalization capabilities. During
inference, MMOC dynamically activates the most suitable model for each test
sample via a loss-based routing mechanism that evaluates both contrastive and
reconstruction losses. This dual consideration allows for a comprehensive
measurement of data drift at both structural and semantic levels. Experimental
results on the SEED and Dreamer datasets show that MMOC achieves
state-of-the-art performance: 85.39% on SEED, and 68.77% and 69.37% on Dreamer
arousal and valence dimensions, respectively. MMOC effectively mitigates
inter-subject data drift, offering a practical solution for real-world EEG
emotion recognition.

Conclusion: Jackknife检测器在非高斯噪声环境中表现出高效和鲁棒性，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial to ensure the reliability of navigation systems.
However, mainstream fault detection methods are developed based on Gaussian
assumptions on nominal errors, while current attempts at non-Gaussian fault
detection are either heuristic or lack rigorous statistical properties. The
performance and reliability of these methods are challenged in real-world
applications. This paper proposes the jackknife detector, a fault detection
method tailored for linearized pseudorange-based positioning systems under
non-Gaussian nominal errors. Specifically, by leveraging the jackknife
technique, a test statistic is derived as a linear combination of measurement
errors, eliminating the need for restrictive distributional assumptions while
maintaining computational efficiency. A hypothesis test with the Bonferroni
correction is then constructed to detect potential faults in measurements.
Theoretical analysis proves the equivalence between the jackknife detector and
the solution separation (SS) detector, while revealing the former's superior
computational efficiency. Through a worldwide simulation and a real-world
satellite clock anomaly detection experiment--both involving non-Gaussian
nominal errors--the proposed jackknife detector demonstrates equivalent
detection performance to the SS detector but achieves a fourfold improvement in
computational efficiency. These results highlight the jackknife detector's
substantial potential for real-time applications requiring robust and efficient
fault detection in non-Gaussian noise environments.

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used deterministic method for radio propagation
simulations, capable of producing physically accurate multipath components. The
accuracy depends on the quality of the environment model and its
electromagnetic properties. Recent advances in computer vision and machine
learning have made it possible to reconstruct detailed environment models
augmented with semantic segmentation labels.
  In this letter, we propose a differentiable ray tracing-based radio
propagation simulator that operates directly on point clouds. We showcase the
efficiency of our method by simulating multi-bounce propagation paths with up
to five interactions with specular reflections and diffuse scattering in two
indoor scenarios, each completing in less than 90 ms. Lastly, we demonstrate
how the differentiability of electromagnetic computations can be combined with
segmentation labels to learn the electromagnetic properties of the environment.

Abstract: Atomic receivers based on Rydberg vapor cells as sensors of electromagnetic
fields offer a promising alternative to conventional radio frequency
front-ends. In multi-antenna configurations, the magnitude-only,
phase-insensitive measurements produced by atomic receivers pose challenges for
traditional detection methods. Existing solutions rely on two-step iterative
optimization processes, which suffer from cascaded channel estimation errors
and high computational complexity. We propose a channel state information
(CSI)-free symbol detection method based on in-context learning (ICL), which
directly maps pilot-response pairs to data symbol predictions without explicit
channel estimation. Simulation results show that ICL achieves competitive
accuracy with {higher computational efficiency} compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: 该共形超表面设计为宽视场传感提供了一种新型硬件解决方案，适用于雷达感知、态势感知和导航等领域。

Abstract: Devices that detect angle-of-arrival (AoA) over a wide field of view are
crucial for various applications such as wireless communication and navigation.
They are often installed on platforms with challenging mechanical and stealth
constraints like vehicles, drones, and helmets, where traditional methods --
mechanically rotating antennas or conformal arrays -- tend to be bulky, heavy,
and costly. A recent work has proposed a conformal frequency diverse antenna
that is designed to produce angularly diverse patterns that encode angular
information into frequency sweeps. This capability allows AoA to be determined
across the entire horizon using only two receiving units. This paper
experimentally validates this concept, detailing the prototyping process and
practical design considerations. The AoA detection capabilities of the proposed
device are confirmed through experimental demonstrations. The proposed
conformal metasurfaces offer an alternative hardware solution for sensing over
large fields of view, with potential applications in radar sensing, situational

Conclusion: 提出的CDRL算法能够有效解决认知雷达系统中的时间资源管理问题，提升雷达的扫描和跟踪性能。

Abstract: In this paper, scanning for target detection, and multi-target tracking in a
cognitive radar system are considered, and adaptive radar resource management
is investigated. In particular, time management for radar scanning and tracking
of multiple maneuvering targets subject to budget constraints is studied with
the goal to jointly maximize the tracking and scanning performances of a
cognitive radar. We tackle the constrained optimization problem of allocating
the dwell time to track individual targets by employing a deep deterministic
policy gradient (DDPG) based reinforcement learning approach. We propose a
constrained deep reinforcement learning (CDRL) algorithm that updates the DDPG
neural networks and dual variables simultaneously. Numerical results show that
the radar can autonomously allocate time appropriately so as to maximize the
reward function without exceeding the time constraint.

Conclusion: 新方法为多星座GNSS应用提供了更高的完整性和可用性，有望支持200英尺高度的LPV导航。

Abstract: Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are essential for aviation,
requiring strict integrity monitoring to alert users to hazardously misleading
information. Conventional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and
advanced RAIM (ARAIM) rely heavily on Gaussian models in bounding nominal
errors, which can be overly conservative with real-world non-Gaussian errors
with heavy tails, such as the satellite clock and orbit errors. This paper
proposes an extended jackknife detector capable of detecting multiple
simultaneous faults with non-Gaussian nominal errors. Furthermore, an integrity
monitoring algorithm, jackknife ARAIM, is developed by systematically
exploiting the properties of the jackknife detector in the range domain. A
tight bound of the integrity risk is derived by quantifying the impacts of
hypothetical fault vectors on the position solution. The proposed method is
examined in worldwide simulations, with the nominal measurement error simulated
based on authentic experimental data, which reveals different findings in
existing research. In a setting of a single Global Positioning System (GPS)
constellation, the proposed method reduces the 99.5 percentile vertical
protection level (VPL) 45m, where the VPL of the baseline ARAIM is larger than
50m in most user locations. For dual-constellation (GPS-Galileo) settings,
baseline ARAIM suffers VPL inflation over 60m due to the over-conservatism
induced by the heavy-tailed Galileo signal-in-space range errors, whereas the
proposed jackknife ARAIM retains VPL below 40m, achieving over 92% normal
operations for a 35m Vertical Alert Limit. These improvements have promising
potential to support localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) with a
decision height of 200 ft, enhancing integrity and availability for
multi-constellation GNSS applications.

Motivation: 未来的6G网络需要支持高速连接和可靠的感知能力，而太赫兹系统和XL-MIMO技术是实现这一目标的关键。然而，现有ISAC技术主要基于远场假设，无法适应太赫兹近场传播的独特特性。

Method: 论文系统研究了THz近场传播的特性，包括其三个基本特征，并回顾了利用这些特征提升通信和感知性能的最新方法。此外，提出了基于波数域的近场感知方法和ISAC资源分配框架。

Conclusion: 论文总结了THz近场传播在ISAC中的潜力，并提出了未来研究的多个方向，为6G网络的发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks are expected not only to provide
high-speed connectivity but also to support reliable sensing capabilities,
giving rise to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm. To
enable higher data rates and more accurate sensing, terahertz (THz) systems
empowered by extremely large multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO)
technology are envisioned as key enablers for future ISAC systems. Owing to the
substantial increase in both effective array aperture and carrier frequency, a
considerable portion of future ISAC applications is anticipated to fall within
the near-field coverage region, instead of the conventional far-field. However,
most existing ISAC techniques are designed under the far-field planar wave
assumption, struggling to accommodate the unique characteristics of THz
near-field propagation. To motivate future research into near-field ISAC
research, we systematically investigate the characteristics of THz near-field
propagation and explore its potential to facilitate ISAC systems. Specifically,
we analyze three fundamental characteristics of THz near-field propagation and
review state-of-the-art techniques that exploit these features to boost both
communication and sensing performance. To further harness the angular-range
coupling effect, we zoom into a particularly interesting approach to near-field
sensing based on wavenumber domain. Besides, to exploit the beam squint effect,
an ISAC resource allocation framework is introduced to support integrated
multi-angle sensing and multi-user communication. Finally, we outline promising
directions for future research in this emerging area.

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer remarkable spatial flexibility but face
significant challenges in acquiring high-resolution channel state information

CANet, a robust deep learning model for channel extrapolation in FAS. CANet
combines context-adaptive modeling with a cross-scale attention mechanism and
is built on a ConvNeXt v2 backbone to improve extrapolation accuracy for
unobserved antenna ports. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a novel
spatial amplitude perturbation strategy, inspired by frequency-domain
augmentation techniques in image processing. This motivates the incorporation
of a Fourier-domain loss function, capturing frequency-domain consistency,
alongside a spectral structure consistency loss that reinforces learning
stability under perturbations. Our simulation results demonstrate that CANet
outperforms benchmark models across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
levels.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Metaverse, enhanced by blockchain

wireless communication systems characterized by joint computing and
communication resource constraints. The DAUR algorithm transforms the nonconvex
problem of maximizing the sum of DPE ratios into a solvable convex optimization
problem. It alternates the optimization of key variables, including user
association, work offloading ratios, task-specific computing resource
distribution, bandwidth allocation, user power usage ratios, and server
computing resource allocation ratios. Our extensive numerical results
demonstrate the DAUR algorithm's effectiveness in DPE.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G New Radio (NR) communication systems, with their
high-resolution antenna arrays and extensive bandwidth, offer a transformative
opportunity for high-throughput data transmission and advanced environmental
sensing. Although passive sensing-based SLAM techniques can estimate user
locations and environmental reflections simultaneously, their effectiveness is
often constrained by assumptions of specular reflections and oversimplified map
representations. To overcome these limitations, this work employs a mmWave 5G
NR system for active sensing, enabling it to function similarly to a laser
scanner for point cloud generation. Specifically, point clouds are extracted
from the power delay profile estimated from each beam direction using a binary
search approach. To ensure accuracy, hardware delays are calibrated with
multiple predefined target points. Pose variations of the terminal are then
estimated from point cloud data gathered along continuous trajectory viewpoints
using point cloud registration algorithms. Loop closure detection and pose
graph optimization are subsequently applied to refine the sensing results,
achieving precise terminal localization and detailed radio map reconstruction.
The system is implemented and validated through both simulations and
experiments, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Over the air computation (AirComp) is a promising technique that addresses
big data collection and fast wireless data aggregation. However, in a network
where wireless communication and AirComp coexist, mutual interference becomes a
critical challenge. In this paper, we propose to employ an unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) to enable integrated communication and AirComp, where we
capitalize on UAV mobility with alleviated interference for performance
enhancement. Particularly, we aim to maximize the sum of user transmission rate
with the guaranteed AirComp accuracy requirement, where we jointly optimize the
transmission strategy, signal normalizing factor, scheduling strategy, and UAV
trajectory. We decouple the formulated problem into two layers where the outer
layer is for UAV trajectory and scheduling, and the inner layer is for
transmission and computation. Then, we solve the inner layer problem through
alternating optimization, and the outer layer is solved through soft actor
critic based deep reinforcement learning. Simulation results show the
convergence of the proposed learning process and also demonstrate the
performance superiority of our proposal as compared with the baselines in
various situations.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of uplink fronthaul compression
techniques within Open RAN (O-RAN) to mitigate fronthaul load in decentralized
distributed MIMO (DD-MIMO) systems. With the ever-increasing demand for high
data rates and system scalability, the fronthaul load becomes a critical
bottleneck. Our method uses O-RAN compression techniques to efficiently
compress the fronthaul signals. The goal is to greatly lower the fronthaul load
while having little effect on the overall system performance, as shown by Block
Error Rate (BLER) curves. Through rigorous link-level simulations, we compare
our quantization strategies against a benchmark scenario with no quantization,
providing insights into the trade-offs between fronthaul data rate reduction
and link performance integrity. The results demonstrate that our proposed
quantization techniques not only lower the fronthaul load but also maintain a
competitive link quality, making them a viable solution for enhancing the
efficiency of next-generation wireless networks. This study underscores the
potential of quantization in O-RAN contexts to achieve optimal balance between
system capacity and performance, paving the way for more scalable and robust
DD-MIMO deployments.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has attracted

transmits data bits in both in-phase ($I$) and quadrature ($Q$) channels,
doubling the number of active receive antenna indices and improving spectral

Abstract: Graph-based Point Cloud Networks (PCNs) are powerful tools for processing

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于联邦学习的轻量级零信任网络（LSNet），用于增强无人机网络的安​全性，通过频谱图实现无人机的认证与拒绝。实验结果表明，LSNet在准确性和模型紧凑性方面优于现有基准。

Motivation: 无人机在下一代网络中的应用增加了网络安全挑战，如干扰、窃听和网络攻击，需要一种有效的安全解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级频谱图网络（LSNet），结合联邦学习和零信任机制，用于无人机的认证与拒绝。

Conclusion: 该框架在实际联邦学习场景中具有实用性和有效性，能够显著提升无人机网络的安全性。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being integrated into
next-generation networks to enhance communication coverage and network
capacity. However, the dynamic and mobile nature of UAVs poses significant
security challenges, including jamming, eavesdropping, and cyber-attacks. To
address these security challenges, this paper proposes a federated
learning-based lightweight network with zero trust for enhancing the security
of UAV networks. A novel lightweight spectrogram network is proposed for UAV
authentication and rejection, which can effectively authenticate and reject
UAVs based on spectrograms. Experiments highlight LSNet's superior performance
in identifying both known and unknown UAV classes, demonstrating significant
improvements over existing benchmarks in terms of accuracy, model compactness,
and storage requirements. Notably, LSNet achieves an accuracy of over $80\%$
for known UAV types and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
(AUROC) of $0.7$ for unknown types when trained with all five clients. Further
analyses explore the impact of varying the number of clients and the presence
of unknown UAVs, reinforcing the practical applicability and effectiveness of
our proposed framework in real-world FL scenarios.

### [32] [Ambisonics Encoder for Wearable Array with Improved Binaural Reproduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04108)
*Yhonatan Gayer,Vladimir Tourbabin,Zamir Ben-Hur,David Alon,Boaz Rafaely*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种增强的Ambisonics信号匹配（ASM）编码器，通过将双耳信号匹配（BSM）项整合到优化框架中，提高了Ambisonic信号在双耳再现中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ASM编码器由于麦克风布局的非理想性，限制了空间声音再现的准确性。研究旨在通过改进ASM编码器的损失函数，提升双耳再现质量。

Method: 研究开发了一种数学公式，将ASM和BSM目标整合到一个损失函数中，并通过模拟实验验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，联合ASM-BSM优化能够显著提升双耳再现质量，适用于虚拟和增强现实应用。

Conclusion: 通过整合BSM优化项，该方法为基于Ambisonics的高质量双耳再现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ambisonics Signal Matching (ASM) is a recently proposed signal-independent
approach to encoding Ambisonic signal from wearable microphone arrays, enabling
efficient and standardized spatial sound reproduction. However, reproduction
accuracy is currently limited due to the non-ideal layout of the microphones.
This research introduces an enhanced ASM encoder that reformulates the loss
function by integrating a Binaural Signal Matching (BSM) term into the
optimization framework. The aim of this reformulation is to improve the
accuracy of binaural reproduction when integrating the Ambisonic signal with
Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs), making the encoded Ambisonic signal
better suited for binaural reproduction. This paper first presents the
mathematical formulation developed to align the ASM and BSM objectives in a
single loss function, followed by a simulation study with a simulated
microphone array mounted on a rigid sphere representing a head-mounted wearable
array. The analysis shows that improved binaural reproduction with the encoded
Ambisonic signal can be achieved using this joint ASM-BSM optimization, thereby
enabling higher-quality binaural playback for virtual and augmented reality
applications based on Ambisonics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的目标是开发或分析能够在任意区间内调整语音时长同时保留原信号关键特性的技术。

Method: 通过评估多种主流算法，分析它们如何实现指定区间的时长修改（固定值或比例缩放）。

Result: 研究表明，这些算法能够灵活地修改语音时长，同时保持原始信号的基本特性。

Conclusion: 这些算法在语音处理领域具有重要应用价值，能够支持多样化的时长修改需求。

Abstract: This paper deeply evaluates and analyzes several mainstream algorithms that
can arbitrarily modify the duration of any portion of a given speech signal
without changing the essential properties (e.g., pitch contour, power spectrum,
etc.) of the original signal. Arbitrary modification in this context means that
the duration of any region of the signal can be changed by specifying the
starting and ending time for modification or the target duration of the
specified interval, which can be either a fixed value of duration in the time
domain or a scaling factor of the original duration. In addition, arbitrary
modification also indicates any number of intervals can be modified at the same
time.

Motivation: 解决传统SELD架构在多通道输入数据限制下难以利用大规模预训练的问题，并通过引入语义信息提升任务表现。

Method: 整合预训练的CLAP（音频）和OWL-ViT（视觉）模型，提出跨模态Conformer模块，结合自相关声学特征和左右声道交换数据增强。

Result: 在开发集上，音频和音频-视觉系统均显著超过基线，模型集成和视觉后处理进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 未来将探讨各模态的贡献和架构变体以进一步优化结果。

Abstract: This report presents our systems submitted to the audio-only and audio-visual
tracks of the DCASE2025 Task 3 Challenge: Stereo Sound Event Localization and
Detection (SELD) in Regular Video Content. SELD is a complex task that combines
temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning
across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the
most challenging to model. Traditional SELD architectures rely on multichannel
input, which limits their ability to leverage large-scale pre-training due to
data constraints. To address this, we enhance standard SELD architectures with
semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned
models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are
incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion,
which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. Additionally, we incorporate
autocorrelation-based acoustic features to improve distance estimation. We
pre-train our models on curated synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets and
apply a left-right channel swapping augmentation to further increase the
training data. Both our audio-only and audio-visual systems substantially
outperform the challenge baselines on the development set, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our strategy. Performance is further improved through model
ensembling and a visual post-processing step based on human keypoints. Future
work will investigate the contribution of each modality and explore
architectural variants to further enhance results.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become
indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper
addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear
hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different
contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations
(pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China
(post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data
and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion
leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in
tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),
ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to
generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust
under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to
broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain
management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation
are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency
analysis, and social media insights, the proposed framework showcases how
large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making
processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受压缩感知理论启发，低秩恢复方法在张量领域尚未充分扩展，需要一种高效算法来重构高阶低秩张量。

Method: 扩展了NIHT方法为TNIHT，支持CP和Tucker分解模型，通过张量限制等距性（TRIP）理论保证收敛性。

Result: TNIHT在合成、图像和视频数据上表现优异，优于多种现有算法。

Conclusion: TNIHT是一种有效的高阶低秩张量恢复方法，理论支持强，实验性能优越。

Abstract: Low-rank recovery builds upon ideas from the theory of compressive sensing,
which predicts that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed from
incomplete measurements. Iterative thresholding-type algorithms-particularly
the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used
in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper,
we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery
of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This
extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors
from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent
low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor
low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a
convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted
isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery
guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical
experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在不确定性和噪声环境下，通过观察代理行为逆向推断其效用函数，应用于认知雷达和贝叶斯最优检测器等场景。

Method: 第一章使用经典显示偏好理论；第二章采用贝叶斯方法；第三章提出基于Langevin动态的自适应算法。

Result: 成功重建代理的效用函数，并提出统计检测器和自适应跟踪方法。

Conclusion: 逆向强化学习在理解代理行为方面具有广泛应用潜力，尤其在噪声环境下的适应性方法是一个重要突破。

Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the
third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient
algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and
extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent
actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an
agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a
cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also
addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization
behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine
if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer
(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The
chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing
the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random
horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a
Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise
overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse
stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive
Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions
given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms
presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient
algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic
gradient algorithm is in operation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种灾后动力通信智能网络（PDPCIN），利用无人机和低轨卫星解决通信中断问题，并优化信息年龄、能效和频谱效率。通过分层异构图神经网络（HHGNN）框架解决NP-hard优化问题。

Result: 实验验证了所提方案在信息年龄、能效和频谱效率上的协同优化优于现有基准。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了灾后通信网络的复杂优化问题，为未来类似场景提供了技术参考。

Abstract: This paper designs a post-disaster powered communication intelligent network
(PDPCIN) to address communication disruptions caused by ground base station
(GBS) failures within the post-disaster area. PDPCIN employs unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) to provide wireless data collection (WDC) and wireless energy
transmission (WET) for affected areas and leverages low earth orbit satellites
(LEO SATs) to relay UAV data to the nearest survival GBS. To ensure basic
post-disaster communication while co-optimizing age of information (AoI),
energy efficiency, and spectrum efficiency, intelligent synchronization-UAV
(IS-UAV) architecture, AoI-based four thresholds updating (AFTU) mechanism, and
Dynamic multi-LEO access (DMLA) strategy are proposed. However, three key
challenges remain: time-varying task-resource imbalances, complex topology
caused by multi-device scheduling, and nonlinear coupling in multidimensional
metric optimization, making system optimization NP-hard. Therefore, this paper
proposes a hierarchical heterogeneous graph neural networks (HHGNN) framework.
It models heterogeneous device nodes and their communication relations as a
hierarchical heterogeneous graph structure, integrating our defined graph
sensing, exchange, and mask layer to handle the network's input, feature
propagation, and output. To search appropriate number of single-LEO SATs, we
propose single-LEO SAT density optimization (S-LSDO) algorithm. Finally, we
compare the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art benchmarks to validate its
superior collaborative optimization of AoI, energy efficiency, and spectrum
efficiency. Based on this, we derive the expressions for the expected values of
AoI and stagnant AoI proportion.

TL;DR: RateCount 是一种轻量级、无需学习的方法，通过计算 Wi-Fi 设备发出的探针请求帧速率来估计设备数量，优于传统的机器学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于机器学习的设备计数方法在 MAC 地址随机化条件下效率低下，需要大量数据清洗和模型调优。RateCount 旨在提供一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: RateCount 基于 AP 接收探针请求帧的速率，利用闭式表达式计算设备数量，并引入误差模型估计方差下限。此外，通过设备到人的校准扩展为人群计数。

Result: 实验表明，RateCount 在无需机器学习部署成本的情况下，实现了与现有最先进方法相当的准确性，并在人群计数上显著提升。

Conclusion: RateCount 是一种高效、准确的设备及人群计数方法，优于依赖机器学习的传统方案。

Abstract: A Wi-Fi-enabled device, or simply Wi-Fi device, sporadically broadcasts probe
request frames (PRFs) to discover nearby access points (APs), whether connected
to an AP or not. To protect user privacy, unconnected devices often randomize
their MAC addresses in the PRFs, known as MAC address randomization. While
prior works have achieved accurate device counting under MAC address
randomization, they typically rely on machine learning, resulting in
inefficient deployment due to the time-consuming processes of data cleaning,
model training, and hyperparameter tuning. To enhance deployment efficiency, we
propose RateCount, an accurate, lightweight, and learning-free counting
approach based on the rate at which APs receive PRFs within a window. RateCount
employs a provably unbiased closed-form expression to estimate the device count
time-averaged over the window and an error model to compute the lower bound of
the estimation variance. We also demonstrate how to extend RateCount to people
counting by incorporating a device-to-person calibration scheme. Through
extensive real-world experiments conducted at multiple sites spanning a wide
range of counts, we show that RateCount, without any deployment costs for
machine learning, achieves comparable counting accuracy with the
state-of-the-art learning-based device counting and improves previous people
counting schemes by a large margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可移动天线（MAs）因其能够在有限区域内通过局部移动优化信道条件而受到关注。本文探讨其在物理层服务集成（PHY-SI）中的应用，以同时满足保密性和多播需求。

Method: 采用两层优化框架，结合半正定松弛（SDR）技术和离散采样算法，联合优化保密波束成形、多播波束成形及MAs位置。

Result: 数值结果显示，与固定位置天线（FPAs）相比，MAs显著提升了PHY-SI中可实现的保密速率区域。

Conclusion: MAs在优化信道条件方面具有显著优势，尤其在需要同时满足保密性和多播速率的场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have drawn increasing attention in wireless
communications due to their capability to create favorable channel conditions
via local movement within a confined region. In this letter, we investigate its
application in physical-layer service integration (PHY-SI), where a multi-MA
base station (BS) simultaneously transmits both confidential and multicast
messages to two users. The multicast message is intended for both users, while
the confidential message is intended only for one user and must remain
perfectly secure from the other. Our goal is to jointly optimize the secrecy
and multicast beamforming, as well as the MAs' positions at the BS to maximize
the secrecy rate for one user while satisfying the multicast rate requirement
for both users. To gain insights, we first conduct performance analysis of this
MA-enhanced PHY-SI system in two special cases, revealing its unique
characteristics compared to conventional PHY-SI with fixed-position antennas
(FPAs). To address the secrecy rate maximization problem, we propose a
two-layer optimization framework that integrates the semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) technique and a discrete sampling algorithm. Numerical results
demonstrate that MAs can greatly enhance the achievable secrecy rate region for
PHY-SI compared to FPAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决短码长LDPC码中BP解码性能不足的问题，尤其是识别和扰动导致解码失败的变量节点。

Method: 借鉴基于综合征的神经解码器思想，设计了一种神经网络架构，用于预测需要扰动的变量节点，从而提高多轮BP解码的效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于现有启发式规则，能以更少的多轮解码尝试接近最大似然解码性能。

Conclusion: 该学习方法为提升短LDPC码解码性能提供了一条可行路径，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Error correction at short blocklengths remains a challenge for low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes, as belief propagation (BP) decoding is suboptimal
compared to maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD). While BP rarely makes errors, it
often fails to converge due to a small number of problematic, erroneous
variable nodes (VNs). Multi-round BP (MRBP) decoding improves performance by
identifying and perturbing these VNs, enabling BP to succeed in subsequent
decoding attempts. However, existing heuristic approaches for VN identification
may require a large number of decoding rounds to approach ML performance. In
this work, we draw a connection between identifying candidate VNs to perturb in
MRBP and estimating channel output errors, a problem previously addressed by
syndrome-based neural decoders (SBND). Leveraging this insight, we propose an
SBND-inspired neural network architecture that learns to predict which VNs MRBP
needs to focus on. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning
approach outperforms expert rules from the literature, requiring fewer MRBP
decoding attempts to reach near-MLD performance. This makes it a promising lead
for improving the decoding of short LDPC codes.

Result: 仿真结果显示，与现有基准相比，信道估计精度有显著提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的S-SOMP方案为UCA配置的XL-MIMO系统提供了一种高效的近场3D信道估计方法。

Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple input multiple output (XL-MIMO), a key
technology for 6G communications, faces challenges in near-field channel
estimation due to spherical wavefronts and the need for three-dimensional (3D)
spatial characterization, particularly with uniform circular arrays (UCAs).
This letter proposes a spherical-domain simultaneous orthogonal matching
pursuit (S-SOMP) based scheme tailored for near-field 3D channel estimation in
UCA-equipped XL-MIMO systems. We establish a sparse channel representation
based on the near-field spherical wave model. Then, a novel spherical-domain
transform matrix codebook is designed via joint discrete sampling of distance,
azimuth, and elevation parameters, leveraging analytical approximations to
ensure low correlation between steering vectors. This structured codebook
enables accurate sparse signal recovery using the S-SOMP algorithm for
efficient joint estimation of channel path gains, spatial angles, and
distances. Simulation results demonstrate significant channel estimation
accuracy improvements compared to existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用信道知识地图（CKM）的新方法，实现对非视距（NLoS）环境的集成感知与通信（ISAC），并通过虚拟用户设备（UE）的方式，将通信信道先验转化为感知信道先验，从而提高复杂环境下的感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的无线感知技术主要依赖视距（LoS）假设，限制了其在复杂环境中的应用。作者希望通过利用CKM技术，解决信号遮挡和多径传播的挑战，实现环境感知的非视距ISAC。

Method: 通过将感知目标视为虚拟UE，将通信信道先验转化为感知信道先验，利用信道角度-延迟图（CADM）作为CKM的具体实现，推导出感知信道的角度-延迟先验，从而实现NLoS环境下的目标定位。

Conclusion: 通过将CKM技术应用于ISAC系统，本文展示了通信与感知信道共享同一先验的潜力，为复杂环境中的无线感知提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As one of the key usage scenarios for the sixth generation (6G) wireless
networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) provides an efficient
framework to achieve simultaneous wireless sensing and communication. However,
traditional wireless sensing techniques mainly rely on the line-of-sight (LoS)
assumptions, i.e., the sensing targets are directly visible to both the sensing
transmitter and receiver. This hinders ISAC systems to be applied in complex
environments such as the urban low-altitude airspace, which usually suffers
from signal blockage and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) multi-path propagation. To
address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to enable
environment-aware NLoS ISAC by leveraging the new technique called channel
knowledge map (CKM), which was originally proposed for environment-aware
wireless communications. One major novelty of our proposed method is that the
same CKM built for wireless communication can be directly used to enable NLoS
wireless sensing, thus enjoying the benefits of ``killing two birds with one
stone''. To this end, the sensing targets are treated as virtual user equipment
(UE), and the wireless communication channel priors are transformed into the
sensing channel priors, allowing one single CKM to serve dual purposes. We
illustrate our proposed framework by a specific CKM called \emph{channel
angle-delay map} (CADM). Specifically, the proposed framework utilizes CADM to
derive angle-delay priors of the sensing channel by exploiting the relationship
between communication and sensing angle-delay distributions, enabling sensing
target localization in the challenging NLoS environment. Extensive simulation
results demonstrate significant performance improvements over classic
geometry-based sensing methods, which is further validated by Cram\'er-Rao
Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的分析框架，基于多维偏微分方程（PDEs）来研究随时间变化的采样速率下的信息新鲜度（AoI）问题，并展示了AoI的非记忆特性及其优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究实时系统中信息新鲜度的量化问题，特别是采样速率随时间变化的情况，传统静态分析方法不适用。

Method: 提出基于多维PDEs的分析框架，采用分解技术解决高维PDE，推导AoI分布，并扩展到稳态条件下的求解。

Result: AoI不具备无记忆性，对采样速率变化的响应存在滞后，且单一预抢占概率或处理时间分布无法在所有情况下最小化AoI违规概率。

Conclusion: 通过优化问题提出启发式方法，能够在满足AoI约束的同时降低系统成本。

Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) is a crucial metric for quantifying information
freshness in real-time systems where the sampling rate of data packets is
time-varying. Evaluating AoI under such conditions is challenging, as system
states become temporally correlated and traditional stationary analysis is
inapplicable. We investigate an $M_{t}/G/1/1$ queueing system with a
time-varying sampling rate and probabilistic preemption, proposing a novel
analytical framework based on multi-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) to capture the time evolution of the system's status distribution. To
solve the PDEs, we develop a decomposition technique that breaks the
high-dimensional PDE into lower-dimensional subsystems. Solving these
subsystems allows us to derive the Aol distribution at arbitrary time
instances. We show AoI does not exhibit a memoryless property, even with
negligible processing times, due to its dependence on the historical sampling
process. Our framework extends to the stationary setting, where we derive a
closed-form expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes Transform (LST) of the
steady-state AoI. Numerical experiments reveal AoI exhibits a non-trivial lag
in response to sampling rate changes. Our results also show that no single
preemption probability or processing time distribution can minimize Aol
violation probability across all thresholds in either time-varying or
stationary scenarios. Finally, we formulate an optimization problem and propose
a heuristic method to find sampling rates that reduce costs while satisfying
AoI constraints.

Abstract: This paper introduces an access point-user (AP-UE) association strategy
combined with pilot power allocation to mitigate multiuser interference and
enhance spectral efficiency (SE) in clustered cell-free massive MIMO
(CCF-mMIMO) networks. We propose a dynamic channel-based clustering method that
groups APs according to their channel correlation, ensuring users are
associated with APs exhibiting similar channel characteristics. The proposed
approach exploits hierarchical clustering, enabling flexible cluster sizing to
improve interference management and overall SE. Moreover, we present a power
control (PC) technique that is based on a weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM)
algorithm to ensure consistent service quality across users. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior SE and robust
performance in high-density multi-user environments as compared to competing
approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation for multi-dielectric
waveguide-assisted broadcast systems, where each waveguide employs multiple
pinching antennas (PAs), aiming to maximize the minimum achievable rate among
multiple users. To capture realistic propagation effects, we propose a novel
generalized frequency-dependent power attenuation model for dielectric
waveguides PA system. We jointly optimize waveguide beamforming, PA power
allocation, and antenna positions via a block coordinate descent scheme that
capitalizes on majorization minimization and penalty methods, circumventing the
inherent non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem and obtaining a
computationally efficient sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate
that our proposed framework substantially outperforms both conventional antenna
systems and single-PA-per-waveguide configurations, clearly illustrating the
intricate trade-offs between waveguide propagation loss, path loss, and
resource allocation among multiple PAs.

Result: 算法不仅保证了全局最优解，还能高效求解，时间复杂度为O(ML²log(ML))。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效解决了MTS放置问题，为无线信号聚焦提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper studies the optimal placement of ceiling-mounted metasurfaces
(MTSs) to help focus the wireless signal beam onto the target receiver, as
inspired by the theatre spotlight. We assume that a total of $M$ MTSs are
deployed, and that there are $L$ possible positions for each MTS. The resulting
signal-to-noise (SNR) maximization problem is difficult to tackle directly
because of the coupling between the placement decisions of the different MTSs.
Mathematically, we are faced with a nonlinear discrete optimization problem
with $L^M$ possible solutions. A remarkable result shown in this paper is that
the above challenging problem can be efficiently solved within
$O(ML^2\log(ML))$ time. There are two key steps in developing the proposed
algorithm. First, we successfully decouple the placement variables of different
MTSs by introducing a continuous auxiliary variable $\mu$; the discrete primal
variables are now easy to optimize when $\mu$ is held fixed, but the
optimization problem of $\mu$ is nonconvex. Second, we show that the
optimization of continuous $\mu$ can be recast into a discrete optimization
problem with only $LM$ possible solutions, so the optimal $\mu$ can now be
readily obtained. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can not
only guarantee a global optimum but also reach the optimal solution
efficiently.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出Audio-JEPA，一种专为音频数据设计的自监督学习框架，通过预测掩码频谱图块的潜在表示，性能媲美现有方法但训练数据更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于JEPA范式，为音频数据设计专门的自监督学习框架，无需大量标注数据即可高效训练。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer预测掩码频谱图块的潜在表示，而非重建原始音频。在AudioSet上预训练，采用随机掩码策略。

Result: 在X-ARES测试集上表现与wav2vec 2.0和data2vec相当，但训练数据仅为其五分之一，且无需超参数调优。

Conclusion: Audio-JEPA是一种高效且轻量级的音频表示学习方法，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Abstract: Building on the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) paradigm, a
recent self-supervised learning framework that predicts latent representations
of masked regions in high-level feature spaces, we propose Audio-JEPA (Audio
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), tailored specifically for audio data.
Audio-JEPA uses a simple Vision Transformer backbone to predict latent
representations of masked spectrogram patches rather than reconstructing raw
audio. We pre-train on unlabeled AudioSet clips (10s, 32kHz) with random patch
masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech,
music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a
straightforward translation of the original model to audio, the results still
show comparable performance to wav2vec 2.0 and data2vec while using less than
one-fifth of their training data and with no hyper-parameter tuning. All code
and pretrained checkpoints will be released on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的磁共振指纹图谱（MRF）字典匹配方法在参数增加时面临计算和内存成本指数级增长的问题，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 采用基于结构化状态空间模型的双Mamba编码器和GAST处理器，以线性复杂度捕捉长程空间依赖性。

Result: 在5倍加速的模拟MRF数据上，T1 PSNR达33.12 dB，T2 PSNR达30.62 dB，SSIM为0.9124。活体实验显示解剖细节和伪影减少。

Conclusion: GAST-Mamba为高度欠采样MRF采集提供了一种准确的、可扩展的替代方法，优于传统基于字典匹配的方法。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) enables fast quantitative imaging by
matching signal evolutions to a predefined dictionary. However, conventional
dictionary matching suffers from exponential growth in computational cost and
memory usage as the number of parameters increases, limiting its scalability to
multi-parametric mapping. To address this, recent work has explored deep
learning-based approaches as alternatives to DM. We propose GAST-Mamba, an
end-to-end framework that combines a dual Mamba-based encoder with a Gate-Aware
Spatial-Temporal (GAST) processor. Built on structured state-space models, our
architecture efficiently captures long-range spatial dependencies with linear
complexity. On 5 times accelerated simulated MRF data (200 frames), GAST-Mamba
achieved a T1 PSNR of 33.12~dB, outperforming SCQ (31.69~dB). For T2 mapping,
it reached a PSNR of 30.62~dB and SSIM of 0.9124. In vivo experiments further
demonstrated improved anatomical detail and reduced artifacts. Ablation studies
confirmed that each component contributes to performance, with the GAST module
being particularly important under strong undersampling. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of GAST-Mamba for accurate and robust
reconstruction from highly undersampled MRF acquisitions, offering a scalable
alternative to traditional DM-based methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个系统评估框架和基于卡尔曼滤波的UniKF算法，用于多源融合评估和BEV检测融合，实验显示UniKF在定位、方向和维度误差上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多源融合在自主系统中至关重要，但如何独立于检测误差评估融合性能仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过向真实边界框注入受控噪声来隔离融合过程，并提出了基于卡尔曼滤波的UniKF算法用于BEV检测融合。

Result: UniKF在不同噪声水平下优于基线方法，定位和方向误差降低3倍，维度误差降低2倍，精度和召回率接近完美。

Conclusion: UniKF提供了一种高效的多源融合方法，显著提升了感知性能。

Abstract: Reliable multi-source fusion is crucial for robust perception in autonomous
systems. However, evaluating fusion performance independently of detection
errors remains challenging. This work introduces a systematic evaluation
framework that injects controlled noise into ground-truth bounding boxes to
isolate the fusion process. We then propose Unified Kalman Fusion (UniKF), a
late-fusion algorithm based on Kalman filtering to merge Bird's Eye View (BEV)
detections while handling synchronization issues. Experiments show that UniKF
outperforms baseline methods across various noise levels, achieving up to 3x
lower object's positioning and orientation errors and 2x lower dimension
estimation errors, while maintaining nearperfect precision and recall between
99.5% and 100%.
