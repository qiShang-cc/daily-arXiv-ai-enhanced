### [1] [A Masked Representation Learning to Model Cardiac Functions Using Multiple Physiological Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08830)
*Seong-A Park,Jong-Eui Chae,Sungdong Kim,Hyung-Chul Lee,Hyun-Lim Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SNUPHY-M的多模态自监督学习模型，用于分析心电图（ECG）、光电容积图（PPG）和动脉血压（ABP）信号，以提升血液动力学的早期诊断和非侵入性管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床中血液动力学的监测至关重要，但现有研究多集中于单一信号分析，缺乏实际临床场景所需的复杂信号综合分析。因此，需要一种能够整合多生理信号的方法来支持精准诊断和决策。

Method: 采用自监督学习（SSL）方法，开发了SNUPHY-M模型，通过恢复三种掩蔽生理信号（ECG、PPG和ABP）来提取反映心脏周期的电学、压力和流体特性的生理特征。

Result: SNUPHY-M在低血压、心输出量、血压预测等临床任务中显著优于现有监督或自监督模型，尤其在使用非侵入性信号的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: SNUPHY-M是首个将多模态自监督学习应用于心血管分析的模型，有效支持临床决策和无创诊断，为血液动力学的早期管理提供了重要工具。

Abstract: In clinical settings, monitoring hemodynamics is crucial for managing patient
prognosis, necessitating the integrated analysis of multiple physiological
signals. While recent research has analyzed single signals such as
electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG), there has yet to be a
proposal for an approach that encompasses the complex signal analysis required
in actual clinical scenarios. In this study, we introduce the SNUPHY-M (Seoul
National University hospital PHYsiological signal Masked representation
learning) model extracts physiological features reflecting the electrical,
pressure, and fluid characteristics of the cardiac cycle in the process of
restoring three masked physiological signals based on self-supervised learning
(SSL): ECG, PPG, and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. By employing
multiple physical characteristics, the model can extract more enriched features
only using non-invasive signals. We evaluated the model's performance in
clinical downstream tasks such as hypotension, stroke volume, systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and age prediction. Our results showed that
the SNUPHY-M significantly outperformed supervised or SSL models, especially in
prediction tasks using non-invasive signals. To the best of our knowledge,
SNUPHY-M is the first model to apply multi-modal SSL to cardiovascular analysis
involving ECG, PPG, and ABP signals. This approach effectively supports
clinical decision-making and enables precise diagnostics, contributing
significantly to the early diagnosis and management of hemodynamics without
invasiveness.

*Jarvis Haupt,Qin Lu,Yanning Shen,Jia Chen,Yue Dong,Dan McCreary,Mehmet Akçakaya,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AI在教育领域的应用，特别是信号处理领域，旨在解决公平性、包容性等技术问题，并通过智能教材推动教育改革。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在推动全球教育公平和提升人类福祉方面的潜力，尤其是在信号处理教育中的应用。

Method: 提供技术问题的入门知识，开发沉浸式、结构化的智能教材，并探讨如何确保AI工具的透明度和可信赖性。

Result: 为研究者和教育者提供了一个资源，帮助他们在工程教育中更好地利用AI技术。

Conclusion: AI在教育领域的应用具有广阔前景，但仍需解决公平、透明等技术和社会问题。

Abstract: Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools that have emerged in recent years
-- including large language models, automated coding assistants, and advanced
image and speech generation technologies -- are the result of monumental human
achievements. These breakthroughs reflect mastery across multiple technical
disciplines and the resolution of significant technological challenges.
However, some of the most profound challenges may still lie ahead. These
challenges are not purely technical but pertain to the fair and responsible use
of AI in ways that genuinely improve the global human condition. This article
explores one promising application aligned with that vision: the use of AI
tools to facilitate and enhance education, with a specific focus on signal
processing (SP). It presents two interrelated perspectives: identifying and
addressing technical limitations, and applying AI tools in practice to improve
educational experiences. Primers are provided on several core technical issues
that arise when using AI in educational settings, including how to ensure
fairness and inclusivity, handle hallucinated outputs, and achieve efficient
use of resources. These and other considerations -- such as transparency,
explainability, and trustworthiness -- are illustrated through the development
of an immersive, structured, and reliable "smart textbook." The article serves
as a resource for researchers and educators seeking to advance AI's role in
engineering education.

### [3] [Ultrafast Deep Learning-Based Scatter Estimation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08973)
*Harshit Agrawal,Ari Hietanen,Simo Särkkä*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究通过在不同分辨率下应用网络并提出基于速度和准确性的最优解决方案，显著降低了CBCT散射估计的计算资源需求，同时保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT扫描中的散射伪影严重影响图像质量，而现有深度学习方法的庞大内存占用限制了其在移动CBCT系统或边缘设备上的部署。

Method: 研究首先在六种分辨率下比较了四种插值方法的CBCT散射信号重建误差，随后训练并评估了五种图像分辨率下的最新方法，以减少FLOPs、推理时间和GPU内存需求。

Result: 减少输入大小和网络参数使FLOPs降低了78倍，同时保持了与基线方法相当的MAPE和MSE性能；推理时间和GPU内存使用分别减少了16倍和12倍。

Conclusion: 研究强调了降采样在深度学习散射估计中的重要性，方法显著降低了资源需求，使其适用于资源受限的环境如移动CBCT和边缘设备。

Abstract: Purpose: Scatter artifacts drastically degrade the image quality of cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Although deep learning-based methods show
promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in
mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory
footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks
at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and
accuracy.
  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter
signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods.
Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image
resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations
(FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.
  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold
reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable
performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and
mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to
4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \times
10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and
12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected
reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water
and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.
  Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling
in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The substantial reduction in FLOPs
and GPU memory requirements achieved by our method enables scatter correction
in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile CBCT and edge devices.

TL;DR: 本文主张将韧性作为6G网络的主要设计目标之一，强调其在技术、架构和经济方面的重要性，并提出3R框架（可靠性、健壮性、韧性）来量化韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络从效率优先转向可持续性意识，促使将韧性（resilience）列为6G的核心设计目标之一，以应对复杂和长期的干扰。

Method: 通过分析移动网络与其他关键系统（如能源、交通和应急服务）的依赖关系，提出3R框架，并转化为可量化的能力（如优雅降级、快速重构等）。架构上提出边缘原生、开放接口和可编程性设计。

Result: 提出了一系列技术（如AI原生控制环路、零信任安全）和经济（开放平台、商业模式）的赋能手段，以增强6G的韧性。

Conclusion: 本文为6G韧性的研究奠定了基础，旨在启发各界共同推动6G韧性的发展。

Abstract: 6G must be designed to withstand, adapt to, and evolve amid prolonged,
complex disruptions. Mobile networks' shift from efficiency-first to
sustainability-aware has motivated this white paper to assert that resilience
is a primary design goal, alongside sustainability and efficiency, encompassing
technology, architecture, and economics. We promote resilience by analysing
dependencies between mobile networks and other critical systems, such as
energy, transport, and emergency services, and illustrate how cascading
failures spread through infrastructures. We formalise resilience using the 3R
framework: reliability, robustness, resilience. Subsequently, we translate this
into measurable capabilities: graceful degradation, situational awareness,
rapid reconfiguration, and learning-driven improvement and recovery.
  Architecturally, we promote edge-native and locality-aware designs, open
interfaces, and programmability to enable islanded operations, fallback modes,
and multi-layer diversity (radio, compute, energy, timing). Key enablers
include AI-native control loops with verifiable behaviour, zero-trust security
rooted in hardware and supply-chain integrity, and networking techniques that
prioritise critical traffic, time-sensitive flows, and inter-domain
coordination.
  Resilience also has a techno-economic aspect: open platforms and high-quality
complementors generate ecosystem externalities that enhance resilience while
opening new markets. We identify nine business-model groups and several
patterns aligned with the 3R objectives, and we outline governance and
standardisation. This white paper serves as an initial step and catalyst for 6G
resilience. It aims to inspire researchers, professionals, government
officials, and the public, providing them with the essential components to
understand and shape the development of 6G resilience.

### [5] [Personalized Sleep Prediction via Deep Adaptive Spatiotemporal Modeling and Sparse Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09018)
*Xueyi Wang,C. J. C.,Lamoth,Elisabeth Wilhelm*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应时空模型（AdaST-Sleep）用于预测睡眠评分，结合卷积层和循环神经网络层处理时空特征，并通过领域分类器实现跨主体泛化。实验表明该方法在多个窗口尺寸下优于基线模型，具有适应性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠预测有助于个体和医疗提供者提前干预影响睡眠的因素，改善身心健康。当前方法在稀疏数据和跨主体适应性上存在挑战。

Method: AdaST-Sleep模型结合卷积层（捕捉空间特征）和循环神经网络层（处理时间序列数据），并集成领域分类器以增强跨主体泛化能力。实验测试了多种输入和预测窗口尺寸。

Result: 模型在7天输入窗口和1天预测窗口下取得最低RMSE（0.282），并能准确追踪睡眠评分水平和日常波动，表现出对未来多日预测的适应性。

Conclusion: AdaST-Sleep为使用商业可穿戴设备稀疏数据进行个性化睡眠预测提供了鲁棒且适应性强的解决方案，验证了其在真实场景中的实用价值。

Abstract: A sleep forecast allows individuals and healthcare providers to anticipate
and proactively address factors influencing restful rest, ultimately improving
mental and physical well-being. This work presents an adaptive spatial and
temporal model (AdaST-Sleep) for predicting sleep scores. Our proposed model
combines convolutional layers to capture spatial feature interactions between
multiple features and recurrent neural network layers to handle longer-term
temporal health-related data. A domain classifier is further integrated to
generalize across different subjects. We conducted several experiments using
five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 days) and five predicting window sizes
(1, 3, 5, 7, 9 days). Our approach consistently outperformed four baseline
models, achieving its lowest RMSE (0.282) with a seven-day input window and a
one-day predicting window. Moreover, the method maintained strong performance
even when forecasting multiple days into the future, demonstrating its
versatility for real-world applications. Visual comparisons reveal that the
model accurately tracks both the overall sleep score level and daily
fluctuations. These findings prove that the proposed framework provides a
robust and adaptable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse
data from commercial wearable devices and domain adaptation techniques.

### [6] [Improving the Elevational Focusing of Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning (FORCES) Ultrasound Imaging using Retrospective Transmit Beamforming (RTB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09056)
*Michael Caulfield,Randy Palamar,Darren Dahunsi,Mohammad Rahim Sobhani,Negar Majidi,Roger Zemp*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的FORCES成像方案，通过应用逆向发射波束成形（RTB）在垂直方向实现全图像平面的聚焦。实验证明，RTB显著提高了远离焦点的垂直聚焦能力，并在焦点处保持或优于标准FORCES的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FORCES成像方案在垂直方向的聚焦能力较差，尤其是在远离焦点时。研究旨在通过RTB技术改善这一问题，实现全图像平面的垂直发射聚焦。

Method: 在FORCES成像方案中应用RTB技术，并通过实验评估改进后的uFORCES和FORCES方法在囊肿和线模体成像中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，RTB显著提升了远离焦点时的垂直聚焦能力，且在焦点处的性能与标准FORCES相当或更优。具体通过线模体的半高全宽和囊肿模体的广义信噪比进行量化。

Conclusion: RTB技术有效解决了FORCES成像方案中垂直方向聚焦不足的问题，为RCAs在体积成像中的应用提供了更优的方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in Row Column Arrays (RCAs) have presented promising
options for volumetric imaging without the need for the excessive channel
counts of fully wired 2D-arrays. Bias programmable RCAs, also known as Top
Orthogonal to Bottom Electrode (TOBE) Arrays, show further promise in that
imaging schemes, such as Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning
(FORCES) allow for full transmit and receive focusing everywhere in the image
plane. However, due to its fixed elevational focus and large transmit aperture,
FORCES experiences poor elevational focusing away from the focal point. In this
study we present a modification to the FORCES imaging scheme by applying
Retrospective Transmit Beamforming (RTB) in the elevational direction to allow
for elevational transmit focusing everywhere in the imaging plane. We evaluate
FORCES and uFORCES methods, with and without RTB applied, when imaging both a
cyst and wire phantom. With experiment we show improved elevational focusing
capabilities away from the focal point when RTB is applied to both FORCES and
uFORCES. At the focal point, performance with RTB remains comparable or
improved relative to standard FORCES. This is quantified by the measurement of
Full Width Half Max when imaging the wire phantom, and by the generalized
Contrast to Noise Ratio when imaging the tubular cyst phantom. We also
demonstrate the volumetric imaging capabilities of FORCES RTB with the wire
phantom.

### [7] [Signed Graph Learning with Hidden Nodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09120)
*Rong Ye,Xue-Qin Jiang,Hui Feng,Jian Wang,Runhe Qiu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法（SGL-HNCS），用于在存在隐藏节点的情况下学习带符号图，通过约束优化和列稀疏正则化重建带符号图的拉普拉斯矩阵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有带符号图学习通常假设所有节点可见，但在某些应用中仅部分节点可观测，剩余节点隐藏。为应对这一挑战，需开发新方法。

Method: 基于图信号在带符号图上平滑的假设，将拓扑推理建模为带列稀疏正则化的约束优化问题，并使用块坐标下降法求解。

Result: 实验结果表明，SGL-HNCS方法在合成和真实数据上均表现高效。

Conclusion: SGL-HNCS成功解决了带隐藏节点的带符号图学习问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Signed graphs, which are characterized by both positive and negative edge
weights, have recently attracted significant attention in the field of graph
signal processing (GSP). Existing works on signed graph learning typically
assume that all graph nodes are available. However, in some specific
applications, only a subset of nodes can be observed while the remaining nodes
stay hidden. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for
identifying signed graph that accounts for hidden nodes, termed \textit{signed
graph learning with hidden nodes under column-sparsity regularization}
(SGL-HNCS). Our method is based on the assumption that graph signals are smooth
over signed graphs, i.e., signal values of two nodes connected by positive
(negative) edges are similar (dissimilar). Rooted in this prior assumption, the
topology inference of a signed graph is formulated as a constrained
optimization problem with column-sparsity regularization, where the goal is to
reconstruct the signed graph Laplacian matrix without disregarding the
influence of hidden nodes. We solve the constrained optimization problem using
a tailored block coordinate descent (BCD) approach. Experimental results using
synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
SGL-HNCS method.

### [8] [Sequential Spectral Clustering of Data Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09144)
*G Dhinesh Chandran,Kota Srinivas Reddy,Srikrishna Bhashyam*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了数据序列的非参数聚类问题，提出了两种算法（SEQ-SPEC和IA-SEQ-SPEC），并通过实验验证其优于现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在未知分布的情况下，通过最小样本量估计数据序列的真实聚类结构。

Method: 提出了两种算法：SEQ-SPEC（保证有限时间停止且指数一致）和计算更高效的IA-SEQ-SPEC。

Result: 实验表明，两种算法在合成和真实数据集上均优于固定样本量的SPEC、SEQ-KMED和SEQ-SLINK。

Conclusion: 这是首次在序列框架下研究谱聚类问题，提出的算法在性能和效率上均表现优越。

Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric clustering of data sequences, where
each data sequence comprises i.i.d. samples generated from an unknown
distribution. The true clusters are the clusters obtained using the Spectral
clustering algorithm (SPEC) on the pairwise distance between the true
distributions corresponding to the data sequences. Since the true distributions
are unknown, the objective is to estimate the clusters by observing the minimum
number of samples from the data sequences for a given error probability. To
solve this problem, we propose the Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm
(SEQ-SPEC), and show that it stops in finite time almost surely and is
exponentially consistent. We also propose a computationally more efficient
algorithm called the Incremental Approximate Sequential Spectral clustering
algorithm (IA-SEQ-SPEC). Through simulations, we show that both our proposed
algorithms perform better than the fixed sample size SPEC, the Sequential
$K$-Medoids clustering algorithm (SEQ-KMED) and the Sequential Single Linkage
clustering algorithm (SEQ-SLINK). The IA-SEQ-SPEC, while being computationally
efficient, performs close to SEQ-SPEC on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on spectral
clustering of data sequences under a sequential framework.

*Ziqi Yan,Zhichao Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据-模型协同驱动的去噪方法JFRFFNet，在JFRFT域中结合神经网络优化滤波参数，仅需部分先验信息即可实现高效去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要完整的先验信息且依赖网格搜索或梯度下降优化参数，JFRFFNet旨在克服这些限制。

Method: 将JFRFT域的维纳滤波模型嵌入神经网络，通过数据驱动方式更新变换-阶对和滤波器系数。

Result: 实验表明，JFRFFNet在输出信噪比上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JFRFFNet为时变图信号去噪提供了一种高效且灵活的新方法。

Abstract: Wiener filtering in the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform
(JFRFT) domain has shown high effectiveness in denoising time-varying graph
signals. Traditional filtering models use grid search to determine the
transform-order pair and compute filter coefficients, while learnable ones
employ gradient-descent strategies to optimize them; both require complete
prior information of graph signals. To overcome this shortcoming, this letter
proposes a data-model co-driven denoising approach, termed neural-network-aided
joint time-vertex fractional Fourier filtering (JFRFFNet), which embeds the
JFRFT-domain Wiener filter model into a neural network and updates the
transform-order pair and filter coefficients through a data-driven approach.
This design enables effective denoising using only partial prior information.
Experiments demonstrate that JFRFFNet achieves significant improvements in
output signal-to-noise ratio compared with some state-of-the-art methods.

*Lin Jin,Hang Sheng,Hui Feng,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用信号相关性的高效采样方法，通过建模相关信道为少数不相关潜在源的线性组合，实现了理论下限的采样密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统独立采样方法导致数据冗余，利用信号相关性可提高采样效率。

Method: 将相关信道建模为不相关潜在源的线性组合，提出了一种多波段采样方案，包括光谱分区、时空采样和插值。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在理论采样密度下实现近乎无损重构。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且验证了理论下限的可行性。

Abstract: Multiple stochastic signals possess inherent statistical correlations, yet
conventional sampling methods that process each channel independently result in
data redundancy. To leverage this correlation for efficient sampling, we model
correlated channels as a linear combination of a smaller set of uncorrelated,
wide-sense stationary latent sources. We establish a theoretical lower bound on
the total sampling density for zero mean-square error reconstruction, proving
it equals the ratio of the joint spectral bandwidth of latent sources to the
number of correlated signal channels. We then develop a constructive multi-band
sampling scheme that attains this bound. The proposed method operates via
spectral partitioning of the latent sources, followed by spatio-temporal
sampling and interpolation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm
that our scheme achieves near-lossless reconstruction precisely at the
theoretical sampling density, validating its efficiency.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Riemannian Potato Field (iRPF)方法，用于快速自动去除EEG信号中的伪迹，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号中的伪迹会降低数据质量，现有方法依赖人工调参、耗时且不稳定，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 改进的Riemannian Potato Field (iRPF)，完全自动化且高效，适用于大规模EEG数据处理。

Result: iRPF在召回率、特异性、精确度和F1分数上分别提升22%、102%、54%和24%，且处理速度快。

Conclusion: iRPF为脑机接口和临床神经影像提供了一种高效、鲁棒的伪迹去除方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signal cleaning has long been a critical
challenge in the research community. The presence of artifacts can
significantly degrade EEG data quality, complicating analysis and potentially
leading to erroneous interpretations. While various artifact rejection methods
have been proposed, the gold standard remains manual visual inspection by human
experts-a process that is time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for
large-scale EEG studies. Existing techniques are often hindered by a strong
reliance on manual hyperparameter tuning, sensitivity to outliers, and high
computational costs. In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato
Field (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that
addresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against
several state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly
available EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG
recordings. Our results demonstrate that iRPF outperforms all competitors
across multiple metrics, with gains of up to 22% in recall, 102% in
specificity, 54% in precision, and 24% in F1-score, compared to Isolation
Forest, Autoreject, Riemannian Potato, and Riemannian Potato Field,
respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these
improvements (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) in most
comparisons. Additionally, on a typical EEG recording iRPF performs artifact
cleaning in under 8 milliseconds per epoch using a standard laptop,
highlighting its efficiency for large-scale EEG data processing and real-time
applications. iRPF offers a robust and data-driven artifact rejection solution
for high-quality EEG pre-processing in brain-computer interfaces and clinical
neuroimaging applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了分析和比较不同导体结构的散射特性，作者提出了一种利用特征模式的方法，并通过模态转换矩阵简化了这一过程。

Method: 通过定义一个模态转换矩阵，将不同结构的特征场与权重系数映射起来，从而分析散射矩阵和扰动矩阵的非对角性质。

Result: 理论得到了两个例子的验证：一是验证方法的正确性，二是展示如何在天线设计过程中应用该方法。

Conclusion: 提出的形式主义方法不仅验证了理论的可行性，还为天线设计提供了实用的分析工具。

Abstract: A formalism is derived to analyze the scattering of a conducting structure
based on the characteristic modes of another structure whose surface is a
superset of the first structure. This enables the analysis and comparison of
different structures using a common basis of characteristic modes.
Additionally, it is shown that the scattering matrices and perturbation
matrices are no longer diagonal in these cases. Based on this, a modal
transformation matrix is defined to describe the mapping between the
characteristic fields and the weighting coefficients of the two structures.
This matrix enables the conversion of the perturbation matrices in different
bases. Finally, two examples are provided along with a discussion of some
aspects of the theory. The first example aims to validate and illustrate the
formalism. The second example shows how the formalism can be applied in the
design process of an antenna element that is gradually modified, starting from
a base structure.

Abstract: Pixel-based fluid antennas provide enhanced multiplexing gains and quicker
radiation pattern switching than traditional designs. However, this innovation
introduces challenges for channel estimation and analog precoding due to the
state-non-separable channel response problem. This paper explores a multiuser
MIMO-OFDM system utilizing pixel-based fluid antennas, informed by measurements
from a real-world prototype. We present a sparse channel recovery framework for
uplink channel sounding, employing an approximate separable channel response
model with DNN-based antenna radiation functions. We then propose two
low-complexity channel estimation algorithms that leverage orthogonal matching
pursuit and variational Bayesian inference to accurately recover channel
responses across various scattering cluster angles. These estimations enable
the prediction of composite channels for all fluid antenna states, leading to
an analog precoding scheme that optimally selects switching states for
different antennas. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms several baseline methods, especially in high
signal-to-noise ratio environments with numerous users.

Abstract: Accurate pathloss prediction is essential for the design and optimization of
UAV-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks. While deep learning approaches
have shown strong potential, their generalization across diverse environments,
robustness to noisy inputs, and sensitivity to UAV altitude remain
underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose a UNet-based deep
learning architecture that combines multi-scale feature extraction,
convolution-based feature fusion, and an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP)
bottleneck for efficient context aggregation. The model predicts pathloss maps
from log-distance, line-of-sight (LOS) mask, and building mask inputs. In
addition, we develop a fully vectorized LOS mask computation algorithm that
significantly accelerates pre-processing and enables large-scale dataset
generation. Extensive evaluations on both in-house ray-tracing data and the
RadioMapSeer benchmark demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several
state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and efficiency. All source code is
publicly released to support reproducibility and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在通信能力有限且环境部分可观测的多智能体系统中，任务分配的挑战性问题，尤其是动态和非对称障碍物对现有方法的限制。

Method: 受基于市场的任务分配启发，提出了一种新的分布式协调算法，考虑了非对称障碍物，适用于低通信场景。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，特别是在RoboCup比赛中，任务重叠减少了52%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效应对动态、非对称障碍物和通信受限的环境，提高了多智能体系统的协调效率。

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited
communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated
task.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于3D纤维系泊（3DFiT）技术的轻量化无人机框架，通过单股连续纤维构建面心立方（FCC）晶格结构，显著提高了结构的比强度和减轻了重量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空航天和机器人领域对轻量高强复合材料结构的需求日益增长，传统制造方法难以实现复杂3D结构且存在连接薄弱的问题。

Method: 采用3DFiT技术，通过连续单股纤维精确排列构建FCC晶格结构，消除了传统复合材料组装的薄弱点。

Result: 制造的无人机框架比强度是金属和热塑性材料的4-8倍，重量仅260克，比商用DJI F450轻10%，飞行时间延长了3分钟。

Conclusion: 研究表明，单股晶格桁架结合3DFiT技术是一种可扩展且高效的方法，为轻量化结构制造提供了新思路。

Abstract: The demand for lightweight and high-strength composite structures is rapidly
growing in aerospace and robotics, particularly for optimized drone frames.
However, conventional composite manufacturing methods struggle to achieve
complex 3D architectures for weight savings and rely on assembling separate
components, which introduce weak points at the joints. Additionally,
maintaining continuous fiber reinforcement remains challenging, limiting
structural efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate the lightweight Face
Centered Cubic (FFC) lattice structured conceptualization of drone frames for
weight reduction and complex topology fabrication through 3D Fiber Tethering
(3DFiT) using continuous single tow fiber ensuring precise fiber alignment,
eliminating weak points associated with traditional composite assembly.
Mechanical testing demonstrates that the fabricated drone frame exhibits a high
specific strength of around four to eight times the metal and thermoplastic,
outperforming other conventional 3D printing methods. The drone frame weighs
only 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing
structural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three
minutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under
operational conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of single tow
lattice truss-based drone frames, with 3DFiT serving as a scalable and
efficient manufacturing method.

*Alice Kate Li,Thales C Silva,Victoria Edwards,Vijay Kumar,M. Ani Hsieh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种基于流场的运动规划方法KoopMotion，利用Koopman算子构建动态系统以模拟期望轨迹，并通过流场的发散特性实现平滑运动，使机器人收敛至目标轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman算子理论虽能有效建模动态系统，但无法保证收敛至目标轨迹或终点。文中旨在通过学习演示数据（LfD）解决这一问题。

Method: KoopMotion将运动流场建模为动态系统，参数化为Koopman算子，利用流场的发散特性生成平滑运动场，确保机器人远离目标轨迹时仍能收敛并跟踪至终点。

Result: 在LASA手写数据集和3D机械臂末端轨迹数据集上验证了有效性，包括谱分析。实物实验在微型自主水面机器人上成功验证。样本效率高，仅需3%数据生成密集运动计划。

Conclusion: KoopMotion在时空动态建模效果上显著优于基线方法，适用于非静态流体环境等复杂场景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Motivation: 传统固定自由度加载机构因执行器过多、控制复杂及动态任务适应性差，限制其应用。本研究旨在开发一种结构简单、适应性强的机械臂解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了欠驱动变形机构在高效、灵活加载应用中的潜力，并为相关机器人系统开发提供了通用建模和优化框架。

Abstract: Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive
actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This
study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading
manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive
gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the
topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional
actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to
diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed,
and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping
configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is
utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust
adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the
UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and
effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work
underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in
applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the
specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends
to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the
development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了双足机器人在复杂环境中的运动稳定性和感知能力。

Abstract: Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in
unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex
terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we
propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model
(LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM
provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of
mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for
terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the
robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that
promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM
trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and
stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes
stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately
evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and
robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal
robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results
demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and
consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.

Result: 实验表明，AEOS在仿真和真实环境中显著提高了里程计精度，并保持实时性能。

Conclusion: AEOS通过生物启发的自适应LiDAR控制，有效解决了无人机LiDAR系统的局限性，提升了性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D perception and localization on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are fundamentally limited by the narrow field of view (FoV) of compact LiDAR
sensors and the payload constraints that preclude multi-sensor configurations.
Traditional motorized scanning systems with fixed-speed rotations lack scene
awareness and task-level adaptability, leading to degraded odometry and mapping
performance in complex, occluded environments. Inspired by the active sensing
behavior of owls, we propose AEOS (Active Environment-aware Optimal Scanning),
a biologically inspired and computationally efficient framework for adaptive
LiDAR control in UAV-based LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO). AEOS combines model
predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) in a hybrid
architecture: an analytical uncertainty model predicts future pose
observability for exploitation, while a lightweight neural network learns an
implicit cost map from panoramic depth representations to guide exploration. To
support scalable training and generalization, we develop a point cloud-based
simulation environment with real-world LiDAR maps across diverse scenes,
enabling sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments demonstrate that AEOS significantly improves odometry
accuracy compared to fixed-rate, optimization-only, and fully learned
baselines, while maintaining real-time performance under onboard computational
constraints. The project page can be found at

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态预测和适应性规划，显著提升了自主代客泊车的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated
planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking
in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on
instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that
predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between
initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of
dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that
incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View
(FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions.
Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances
goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on
information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at
promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots,
we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency,
safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion in outdoor environments presents significant
challenges for quadruped robots. Accurate environmental prediction and
effective handling of depth sensor noise during real-world deployment remain
difficult, severely restricting the outdoor applications of such algorithms. To
address these deployment challenges in vision-based motion control, this letter
proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) framework. The framework
employs a dual-estimator architecture that ensures robust motion performance
while maintaining deployment stability during onboard vision failures. Through
an online estimator adaptation, our method enables seamless transitions between
estimation modules when handling visual perception uncertainties. Experimental
validation on a real-world robot demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in
complex outdoor environments, showing particular advantages in scenarios with
degraded visual perception. This framework demonstrates its potential as a
practical solution for reliable robotic deployment in challenging field
conditions. Project website: https://RENet-Loco.github.io/

Conclusion: OmniEVA为多模态大语言模型在体现智能领域的应用提供了新的思路和解决方案，展示了卓越的性能和广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

Conclusion: VLA-Adapter通过高效桥接范式，显著降低部署VLA模型的门槛，同时保持高性能和快速推理。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between
perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language
Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance,
it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We
introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA
models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first
systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present
key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and
action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module
with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into
the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only
a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate
that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also
offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the
proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a
powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly
lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model. Project page:

Conclusion: 该架构有效解决了连续体机器人长期操作中的疲劳问题，提高了安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design,
making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments.
However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation
and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural
failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots
remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we
propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a
Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and
bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration,
while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress
magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains
motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect
corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and
(3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor
torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional
sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation
by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical
limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of
structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.

hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a
novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not
limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR,
multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and
synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across
modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its
capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted
scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release
SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative
indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized
multimodal data and ground-truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based
SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions.
Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR
and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining
open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive
benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM
algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility.

TL;DR: 介绍了一种基于神经形态触觉传感系统和SCNN的滑移检测方法，能够在物体滑移前360毫秒检测到初期滑移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期检测滑移可以提高机器人操作安全性，但目前边缘平台的能耗问题限制了这类系统的应用。

Method: 采用NeuroTac传感器和SCNN模型对三种滑移状态（无滑移、初期滑移、完全滑移）进行分类。

Result: SCNN模型在动态重力诱导的滑移条件下，能够稳定地在完全滑移前360毫秒检测到初期滑移。

Conclusion: 该系统具有稳定且响应迅速的初期滑移检测能力。

Abstract: Detecting incipient slip enables early intervention to prevent object
slippage and enhance robotic manipulation safety. However, deploying such
systems on edge platforms remains challenging, particularly due to energy
constraints. This work presents a neuromorphic tactile sensing system based on
the NeuroTac sensor with an extruding papillae-based skin and a spiking
convolutional neural network (SCNN) for slip-state classification. The SCNN
model achieves 94.33% classification accuracy across three classes (no slip,
incipient slip, and gross slip) in slip conditions induced by sensor motion.
Under the dynamic gravity-induced slip validation conditions, after temporal
smoothing of the SCNN's final-layer spike counts, the system detects incipient
slip at least 360 ms prior to gross slip across all trials, consistently
identifying incipient slip before gross slip occurs. These results demonstrate
that this neuromorphic system has stable and responsive incipient slip
detection capability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于“物体相对”控制的视觉导航新范式，通过对象级表示克服了图像级表示的局限性，并展示了其在跨具身体验和任务中的高不变性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图像相对控制在视觉导航中存在局限性，因为图像严格依赖于代理的位姿和体现。本研究旨在探索对象相对控制的优势，以提供更具不变性和灵活性的导航方案。

Method: 提出了基于“相对”3D场景图的拓扑图表示，并训练了一个本地控制器“ObjectReact”，直接基于高级“WayObject Costmap”表示进行导航。

Result: 实验表明，对象相对控制在传感器高度变化和多种导航任务中优于图像相对控制，且在仿真环境中训练的策略能够很好地泛化到真实室内环境。

Conclusion: 对象相对控制提供了一种更灵活、更具不变性的视觉导航方法，适用于跨具身体验和复杂任务。

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

TL;DR: MOFU机器人通过全身膨胀-收缩运动提升人类对其的生机感，实验证明该运动显著增强感知生机感，但双机器人并未进一步增加效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究全身体积变化运动对机器人感知生机感的影响，填补现有设计中对该运动的忽视。

Method: 开发MOFU机器人，采用Jitterbug结构和双轮驱动，通过在线视频调查评估膨胀-收缩运动的效果。

Result: 膨胀-收缩运动显著提升生机感，双机器人无额外效果，结合运动时生机感更强。

Conclusion: 体积变化运动是提升机器人感知生机感的重要设计元素。

Abstract: Robots for therapy and social interaction are often intended to evoke
"animacy" in humans. While many robots imitate appearance and joint movements,
little attention has been given to whole-body expansion-contraction,
volume-changing movements observed in living organisms, and their effect on
animacy perception. We developed a mobile robot called "MOFU (Morphing Fluffy
Unit)," capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and
covered with a fluffy exterior. MOFU employs a "Jitterbug" structure, a
geometric transformation mechanism that enables smooth volume change in
diameter from 210 to 280 mm using one actuator. It is also equipped with a
differential two-wheel drive mechanism for locomotion. To evaluate the effect
of expansion-contraction movements, we conducted an online survey using videos
of MOFU's behavior. Participants rated impressions with the Godspeed
Questionnaire Series. First, we compared videos of MOFU in a stationary state
with and without expansion-contraction and turning, finding that
expansion-contraction significantly increased perceived animacy. Second, we
hypothesized that presenting two MOFUs would increase animacy compared with a
single robot; however, this was not supported, as no significant difference
emerged. Exploratory analyses further compared four dual-robot motion
conditions. Third, when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion,
animacy ratings were higher than locomotion alone. These results suggest that
volume-changing movements such as expansion and contraction enhance perceived
animacy in robots and should be considered an important design element in
future robot development aimed at shaping human impressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人机MoCap数据使用存在演示不准确和人体与机器人手形态差异的问题，导致数据利用不足和误差累积，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: Dexplore通过统一的单循环优化联合执行重定向和跟踪，将演示作为软指导，从原始轨迹中提取自适应空间范围，并用强化学习训练策略。

Result: 该方法保持了演示意图，支持机器人特定策略，提高了噪声鲁棒性，并能扩展到大规模演示数据，最后生成支持跨对象泛化和实际部署的视觉控制器。

Conclusion: Dexplore为将不完美的MoCap数据转化为有效的灵巧操作训练信号提供了一种有原则的解决方案。

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

TL;DR: SimpleVLA-RL是一种针对VLA模型的高效RL框架，解决了数据稀缺和泛化能力不足的问题，并在实际任务中超越SFT表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型在大规模人类操作数据稀缺和任务分布偏移泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出了SimpleVLA-RL框架，结合轨迹采样、并行化、多环境渲染和优化损失计算等策略。

Result: 在LIBERO和RoboTwin 1.0&2.0上取得SOTA性能，并发现RL训练中的'pushcut'现象。

Conclusion: SimpleVLA-RL减少了数据依赖，提升了泛化能力和实际任务表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

TL;DR: O-RAN架构利用xApps和KPM实现网络优化，通过AI/ML方法动态关闭RU以提升能效，但传统方法可能导致负载不均衡。本文提出一种ML框架，联合优化负载均衡和能效，通过多阈值分类实现高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统动态睡眠方法因UE卸载导致的负载不均衡问题，同时提升网络能效。

Method: 采用随机森林模型的多分类系统，预测RU配置并优化能效，通过多阈值策略平衡节能与性能。

Result: 实验表明，随机森林模型的F1-macro性能达98.3%，较传统方法提升195%。

Conclusion: 提出的ML框架有效解决了负载不均衡与能效优化的矛盾，为O-RAN部署提供实用方案。

Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture provides an intrinsic
capability to exploit key performance monitoring (KPM) within Radio
Intelligence Controller (RIC) to derive network optimisation through xApps.
These xApps can leverage KPM knowledge to dynamically switch on/off the
associated RUs where such a function is supported over the E2 interface.
Several existing studies employ artificial intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning
(ML) based approaches to realise such dynamic sleeping for increased energy
efficiency (EE). Nevertheless, most of these approaches rely upon offloading
user equipment (UE) to carve out a sleeping opportunity. Such an approach
inherently creates load imbalance across the network. Such load imbalance may
impact the throughput performance of offloaded UEs as they might be allocated a
lower number of physical resource blocks (PRBs). Maintaining the same PRB
allocation while addressing the EE at the network level is a challenging task.
To that end, in this article, we present a comprehensive ML-based framework for
joint optimisation of load balancing and EE for ORAN deployments. We formulate
the problem as a multi-class classification system that predictively evaluates
potential RU configurations before optimising the EE, mapping network
conditions to three load balance categories (Well Balanced, Moderately
Balanced, Imbalanced). Our multi-threshold approach (Conservative, Moderate,
Aggressive) accommodates different operational priorities between energy
savings and performance assurance. Experimental evaluation using 4.26 million
real network measurements from simulations demonstrates that our Random Forest
model achieves 98.3% F1-macro performance, representing 195% improvement over
traditional baseline strategies.

Result: 在AOT基准测试和真实飞行测试中表现优异，相对YOLO检测器AUROC提升10%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了无人机在动态空对空环境中的感知可靠性，尤其适合安全关键应用。

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Conclusion: 该视觉驱动的方法为分析非联网车辆行为提供了可行解决方案，具有实用潜力。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Method: 通过分析复杂介质的传输矩阵和微分散射矩阵，发现其秩为一；实验验证了在可编程超构原子参数化的无线链路中的冻结现象。

Result: 微分输出信号具有完美相干性，且热噪声输出模式具有特定结构；通过优化超构原子配置实现了“定制化冻结”。

Conclusion: 这一现象在复杂介质中的成像、传感和通信等领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The sensitivity of transmission to the input wavefront is a hallmark feature
of complex media and the basis for wavefront shaping techniques. Yet,
intriguing special cases exist in which the output wavefront is "frozen"
(agnostic to the input wavefront). This happens when special structure in the
complex medium collapses the rank of its transmission matrix to unity. Here, we
unveil that an analogous phenomenon exists more universally for differential
scattering (including reflection) in reconfigurable complex media.
Specifically, for a localized perturbation, the differential scattering matrix
of any complex medium has rank one. One consequence is that the differential
output signal is perfectly coherent irrespective of the input wavefront's
coherence. Moreover, the thermal noise emitted into the frozen differential
output mode has a particular structure that can be exploited for thermal noise
management. We experimentally evidence frozen differential scattering in a
rich-scattering wireless link parametrized by a programmable meta-atom. Then,
we demonstrate "customized freezing" by optimizing the configuration of
additional programmable meta-atoms that parametrize the wireless link, as
envisioned for 6G networks. We impose particular shapes of the frozen
differential output mode, and maximize its signal-to-thermal-noise ratio.
Potential applications include filtering and stabilization of differential
wavefronts, as well as imaging, sensing, and communication in complex media.

Abstract: This paper investigates the data collection enhancement problem in a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered intelligent consumer
transportation system (ICTS). We propose a novel framework where a data center
(DC) provides energy to pre-configured roadside unit (RSU) pairs during the
downlink stage. While in the uplink stage, these RSU pairs utilize a hybrid
rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA)
protocol to transmit the processed data to the DC, while simultaneously
performing local data processing using the harvested energy. Our objective is
to maximize the minimal processed data volume of the RSU pairs by jointly
optimizing the RIS downlink and uplink phase shifts, the transmit power of the
DC and RSUs, the RSU computation resource allocation, and the time slot
allocation. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we develop an
efficient iterative algorithm integrating alternating optimization and
sequential rank-one constraint relaxation methods. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline
schemes under diverse scenarios, validating its effectiveness in enhancing the
data processing performance for intelligent transportation applications.

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In
particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval
yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline
results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that
carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

Abstract: Sound field reproduction with undistorted sound quality and precise spatial
localization is desirable for automotive audio systems. However, the complexity
of automotive cabin acoustic environment often necessitates a trade-off between
sound quality and spatial accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Spatial Power Map Net (SPMnet), a learning-based sound field reproduction
method that improves both sound quality and spatial localization in complex
environments. We introduce a spatial power map (SPM) constraint, which
characterizes the angular energy distribution of the reproduced field using
beamforming. This constraint guides energy toward the intended direction to
enhance spatial localization, and is integrated into a multi-channel
equalization framework to also improve sound quality under reverberant
conditions. To address the resulting non-convexity, deep optimization that use
neural networks to solve optimization problems is employed for filter design.
Both in situ objective and subjective evaluations confirm that our method
enhances sound quality and improves spatial localization within the automotive
cabin. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of different audio materials and
the arrival angles of the virtual sound source in the reproduced sound field,
investigating the potential underlying factors affecting these results.

Abstract: Multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to identify
Pareto-efficient behavior in a multi-agent system, and reconstruct utility
functions of the individual agents. Motivated by the problem of detecting UAV
coordination, how can we construct a statistical detector for Pareto-efficient
behavior given noisy measurements of the decisions of a multi-agent system?
This paper approaches this IRL problem by deriving necessary and sufficient
conditions for a dataset of multi-agent system dynamics to be consistent with
Pareto-efficient coordination, and providing algorithms for recovering utility
functions which are consistent with the system dynamics. We derive an optimal
statistical detector for determining Pareto-efficient coordination from noisy
system measurements, which minimizes Type-I statistical detection error. Then,
we provide a utility estimation algorithm which minimizes the worst-case
estimation error over a statistical ambiguity set centered at empirical
observations; this min-max solution achieves distributionally robust IRL, which
is crucial in adversarial strategic interactions. We illustrate these results
in a detailed example for detecting Pareto-efficient coordination among
multiple UAVs given noisy measurement recorded at a radar. We then reconstruct
the utility functions of the UAVs in a distributionally robust sense.

Abstract: Many optimization problems in robotics involve the optimization of
time-expensive black-box functions, such as those involving complex simulations
or evaluation of real-world experiments. Furthermore, these functions are often
stochastic as repeated experiments are subject to unmeasurable disturbances.
Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize such methods in an efficient
manner by deploying a probabilistic function estimator to estimate with a given
confidence so that regions of the search space can be pruned away.
Consequently, the success of the Bayesian optimization depends on the function
estimator's ability to provide informative confidence bounds. Existing function
estimators require many function evaluations to infer the underlying confidence
or depend on modeling of the disturbances. In this paper, it is shown that the
confidence bounds provided by the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator
(WS-KDE) are applicable as excellent bounds to any stochastic function with an
output confined to the closed interval [0;1] regardless of the distribution of
the output. This finding opens up the use of WS-KDE for stable global
optimization on a wider range of cost functions. The properties of WS-KDE in
the context of Bayesian optimization are demonstrated in simulation and applied
to the problem of automated trap design for vibrational part feeders.
