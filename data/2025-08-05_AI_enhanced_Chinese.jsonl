However, mmWave signals suffer from their inherent characteristics\nsuch as severe path loss, poor scattering, and limited diffraction, which\nnecessitate the use of large antenna arrays and directional beamforming,\ntypically implemented through massive MIMO architectures. Accurate channel\nestimation is critical in such systems, but its computational complexity\nincreases proportionally with the number of antennas. This may become a\nsignificant burden in mmWave systems where channels exhibit rapid fluctuations\nand require frequent updates. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity\nchannel denoiser based on Bayesian binary hypothesis testing and beamspace\nsparsity. By modeling each sparse beamspace component as a mixture of signal\nand noise under a Bernoulli-complex Gaussian prior, we formulate a likelihood\nratio test to detect signal-relevant elements. Then, a hard-thresholding rule\nis applied to suppress noise-dominant components in the noisy channel vector.\nDespite its extremely low computational complexity, the proposed method\nachieves channel estimation accuracy that is comparable to that of complex\niterative or learning-based approaches. This effectiveness is supported by both\ntheoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, suggesting that the method can\nbe a viable option for mmWave systems with strict resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fe1\u9053\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u9762\u4e34\u4fe1\u53f7\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u5927\u3001\u6563\u5c04\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f2f\u52aa\u5229-\u590d\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u68c0\u9a8c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f8\u5173\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u786c\u9608\u503c\u89c4\u5219\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6210\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u590d\u6742\u8fed\u4ee3\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based\nframeworks, conventional pilot allocation schemes face a trade-off between\nspectral efficiency (SE) and sensing performance. Interleaved pilots improve\nuser equipment (UE) multiplexing through sparse allocation but reduce the\nmaximum unambiguous range. Conversely, orthogonal block-based pilots reduce\nrange ambiguity but degrade sensing resolution due to limited delay\ngranularity. To address this trade-off, the phase-shifted ISAC (PS-ISAC) scheme\nwas recently proposed for uplink multiple access in ISAC systems. However,\nPS-ISAC suffers from spectral inefficiency due to the fixed cyclic prefix (CP)\nconstraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose adaptive\nphase-shifted-ISAC (APS-ISAC), an enhanced pilot scheme that employs an\noverlapped block-pilot structure with UE-specific phase shifts determined by\nmaximum excess delay of each UE. This design enables UEs to share the same\ntime-frequency resources while preserving separable and contiguous channel\nimpulse responses (CIRs) at the base station (BS). Simulation results show that\nAPS-ISAC significantly outperforms conventional pilot allocation methods in\nterms of SE, approximately doubling the number of multiplexed UEs. It also\nachieves lower mean square error (MSE) under power constraints with reduced\ncomplexity. Furthermore, it yields maximum range resolution and unambiguous\nsensing performance.

However, further\nincreasing the number of symbols yields marginal improvements while\nsignificantly increasing computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eOFDM\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08DPE\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5176Cram\u00e9r-Rao\u754c\uff08CRB\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u6b65\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6cd5\u5728NLOS\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDPE\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u9ad8\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u95f4\u8ddd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u591a\u4f7f\u7528OFDM\u7b26\u53f7\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8eOFDM\u7684DPE\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5728NLOS\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eOFDM\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684DPE\u7684CRB\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u6b65\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "1\uff09DPE\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff1b2\uff09\u5927\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u9ad8\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u95f4\u8ddd\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3\uff09\u591aOFDM\u7b26\u53f7\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u8fb9\u9645\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3002", "conclusion": "DPE\u5728OFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6743\u8861\u7b26\u53f7\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We refer\nto this novel computational paradigm as AirFC. We first study the case in which\nthe precoder, combiner, and RIS phase shift matrices are jointly optimized to\nminimize the mismatch between the OAC system and the target FC layer. To solve\nthis non-convex optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity alternating\noptimization algorithm, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all\noptimization variables are derived. Next, we consider training of the system\nparameters using two distinct learning strategies, namely centralized training\nand distributed training. In the centralized training approach, training is\nperformed at either the transmitter or the receiver, whichever possesses the\nchannel state information (CSI), and the trained parameters are provided to the\nother terminal.

In the auditory domain, attention\nenables the prioritization of relevant sounds in an auditory scene and can be\neither attracted by elements in the scene in a bottom-up fashion or directed\ntowards features, objects, or the entire scene in a top-down fashion. How these\nmodes of attention interact and whether their neural underpinnings are distinct\nremains unclear. In this work, we investigate the perceptual and neural\ncorrelates of different attentional modes in a controlled \"cocktail party\"\nparadigm, where listeners listen to the same stimuli and attend to either a\nspatial location (feature-based), a speaker (object-based), or the entire scene\n(global or free-listening) while detecting deviations in pitch of a voice in\nthe scene.

Furthermore,\nobject-based and spatial-based attention engage distinct neural mechanisms and\nare differentially modulated by bottom-up salience. Notably, while bottom-up\nsalience aids in the initial segregation of auditory objects, it plays a\nreduced role in object tracking once attention has been voluntarily allocated.\nIn addition, decoding the stimulus envelope from the EEG data revealed a\nsource-sampling scheme in the global attention mode that is not present in the\nobject or spatial modes. Overall, the study shows that the perception of the\nsame acoustic scene differs according to the listening task, guided by an\ninteraction between top-down and bottom-up processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u542c\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u542c\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u548c\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528'\u9e21\u5c3e\u9152\u4f1a'\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u88ab\u8bd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6216\u6574\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u58f0\u97f3\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u8c61\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u540e\u4f5c\u7528\u51cf\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u542c\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u53d7\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u7531\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u548c\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

The goal for the nodes is to remain as\nfresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we\nassess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart\nmechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip\n(RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that\nneed it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number\nof fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System\n(SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we\npresent an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based\napproach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness\nof nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared\nto traditional gossiping techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u96c6\u7fa4\u5316 Gossip \u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a RC-Gossip \u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cRC-Gossip \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u96c6\u7fa4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u96c6\u7fa4\u5316 Gossip \u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6e90\u8282\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\u540c\u6b65\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f15\u5165 RC-Gossip \u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa RC-Gossip \u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5411\u6700\u9700\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e renewal-reward \u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684 SHS \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "RC-Gossip \u5728\u591a\u79cd\u96c6\u7fa4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u96c6\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "RC-Gossip \u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f20\u64ad\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96c6\u7fa4\u5316 Gossip \u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}
