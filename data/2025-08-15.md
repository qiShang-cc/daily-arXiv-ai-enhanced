*Ferhat Ozgur Catak,Murat Kuzlu,Umit Cali*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种注意力机制（多头注意力、因果注意力和稀疏注意力）与CNN结合在RF信号分类中的表现，提出了一种新型CNN-Transformer混合架构，实验表明稀疏和因果注意力在保持分类性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为提高认知无线电系统和频谱管理中的自动调制分类性能，研究不同注意力机制在RF信号分类中的效果。

Method: 采用CNN-Transformer混合架构，结合三种注意力机制（多头、因果、稀疏），基于RML2016.10a数据集分析其性能。

Result: 多头注意力分类精度最高（85.05%），稀疏和因果注意力显著降低推理时间（分别减少75%和83%），同时保持84%以上的分类精度。

Conclusion: 不同调制方案对注意力机制有不同偏好，研究结果为实时射频信号处理的高效注意力机制设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a critical component in
cognitive radio systems and spectrum management applications. This study
presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of three attention mechanisms
(i.e., baseline multi-head attention, causal attention, and sparse attention)
integrated with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for radio frequency (RF)
signal classification. It proposes a novel CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture
that leverages different attention patterns to capture temporal dependencies in
I/Q samples from the RML2016.10a dataset. The experimental results demonstrate
that while baseline attention achieves the highest accuracy of 85.05\%, causal
and sparse attention mechanisms offer significant computational advantages with
inference times reduced by 83\% and 75\% respectively, while maintaining
competitive classification performance above 84\%. The analysis reveals
distinct attention pattern preferences across different modulation schemes,
providing insights for designing efficient attention mechanisms for real-time
radio signal processing applications.

*Nazanin Mirhosseini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了有界凸体在连续随机正交投影下的信息保留问题，通过推导条件互信息的上界并推广到多次投影，最后探讨了凸体对称性对信息保留的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究有界凸体在连续随机正交投影过程中信息的保留情况，为高维数据降维提供理论基础。

Method: 对凸体进行多次随机正交投影，推导条件互信息的上界，并将其推广到多次投影的情况。

Result: 得出了条件互信息的上界，并发现凸体的对称性会影响该上界的可达性。

Conclusion: 凸体的对称性在连续随机投影过程中对信息保留具有重要影响，研究结果为高维数据降维提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a bounded convex body $K_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$
subjected to two successive random orthogonal projections onto
$\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$, respectively. First, we project
$K_0$ orthogonally onto $U_{1}^{\perp}$, the orthogonal complement of
$\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$, where $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$ is uniformly
distributed on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$. This yields a random convex body $K_1
= \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_1}^{\perp}}(K_0) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. We then repeat
the process, projecting $K_1$ orthogonally onto ${U}_{2}^{\perp}$, the
orthogonal complement of $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_2$ chosen uniformly from the
unit sphere in $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_{1}^{\perp}$ or $S^{n-2}$, resulting in a
second random convex body $K_2 = \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_2}^{\perp}}(K_1) \subset
\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$. To quantify information retention through these sequential
dimension reductions, we derive an upper bound for the conditional mutual
information $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$. Furthermore, we extend this process to $m$
iterations and generalize the upper bound on $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$ to establish
an analogous upper bound for $I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$. Finally, we examine the
influence of $K_0$'s symmetry on the achievability of this upper bound for
$I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$.

### [3] [A Deep Learning based Signal Dimension Estimator with Single Snapshot Signal in Phased Array Radar Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10263)
*Yugang Ma,Yonghong Zeng,Sumei Sun,Gary Lee,Ernest Kurniawan,Francois Chin Po Shin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度学习的信号维度估计方法（DLSDE），利用二维卷积神经网络（2D-CNN）自动提取特征，显著优于传统方法，适用于单次观测，并提高检测SNR和分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号维度是许多高分辨率延迟估计和方向寻找算法的前提，传统方法依赖多观测和特征分解，而现有深度学习方法也不支持单次观测。因此需要一种高效的信号维度估计方法。

Method: 使用二维卷积神经网络（2D-CNN）自动提取信号维度的特征，适用于单次观测（单快照）。

Result: 在32天线相控阵雷达中，DLSDE显著优于传统方法，检测SNR提高>15dB，分辨率提高>1°，且适用于空间相关信号或小角度分离信号。

Conclusion: DLSDE是一种高效的单快照信号维度估计方法，显著提升性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Signal dimension, defined here as the number of copies with different delays
or angular shifts, is a prerequisite for many high-resolution delay estimation
and direction-finding algorithms in sensing and communication systems. Thus,
correctly estimating signal dimension itself becomes crucial. In this paper, we
present a deep learning-based signal dimension estimator (DLSDE) with
single-snapshot observation in the example application of phased array radar.
Unlike traditional model-based and existing deep learning-based signal
dimension estimators relying on eigen-decomposition and information criterion,
to which multiple data snapshots would be needed, the proposed DLSDE uses
two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) to automatically develop
features corresponding to the dimension of the received signal. Our study shows
that DLSDE significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of the
successful detection rate and resolution. In a phased array radar with 32
antenna elements, DLSDE improves detection Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) by >15dB
and resolution by >1{\deg}. This makes the proposed method suitable for
distinguishing multiple signals that are spatially correlated or have small
angular separation. More importantly, our solution operates with a single
snapshot signal, which is incompatible with other existing deep learning-based
methods.

### [4] [Environment Reconstruction in Terahertz Monostatic Sensing: Joint Millimeter-level Geometry Mapping and Material Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10372)
*Zitong Fang,Yejian Lyu,Ziming Yu,Chong Han*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的太赫兹（THz）集成感测与通信（ISAC）框架，结合CCA辅助的多径分量估计和滑动窗口优化策略，实现了高精度的环境重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升太赫兹ISAC系统的环境感知能力，实现高分辨率几何映射和材料分类。

Method: 采用CCA加速参数提取，结合SAGE估计和滑动窗口优化；通过反射损失分析分类信道分量，利用THz-TDS数据库进行材料识别。

Result: 几何映射平均误差4.9 mm，比文献提升一个数量级；材料分类可靠。

Conclusion: 框架显著提升了THz ISAC系统的环境感知精度和效率。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers high-speed
communication alongside precise environmental sensing. This paper presents a
computationally efficient framework for THz-based environment reconstruction by
integrating connected component analysis (CCA)-assisted multipath component
(MPC) estimation with a sliding-window refinement strategy. To start with, a
monostatic sensing experiment is conducted in an indoor scenario using a vector
network analyzer (VNA)-based sounder operating from 290 to 310 GHz. On one
hand, as for geometry mapping, a CCA-based region search is employed to
accelerate parameter extraction, significantly reducing the search space for
space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE)-based estimation
and achieving an 8.4 times acceleration, while preserving resolution. Further
analysis of the connected component structure enables the identification of
indoor features such as flat walls and corners. A sliding-window refinement
applied to the identified regions improves geometric mapping, achieving the
mean distance error of 4.9 mm, which is one order of magnitude better than the
literature. On the other hand, the deterministic and stochastic components of
the monostatic channel are classified through reflection loss analysis. Then,
material identification is performed by looking up the reflection loss in a THz
time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) database, which comprises over 200 materials
across a 0-6 THz range. Experimental results validate millimeter-level accuracy
in geometry mapping and reliable material classification, enhancing the
environmental awareness capabilities of THz ISAC systems.

### [5] [Interleaved Transceiver Design for a Continuous- Transmission MIMO-OFDM ISAC System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10430)

Abstract: This paper proposes an interleaved transceiver design method for a
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) system utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms. We consider a continuous transmission system and focus on the design
of the transmission signal and a receiving filter in the time domain for an
interleaved transmission architecture. For communication performance,
constructive interference (CI) is integrated into the optimization problem. For
radar sensing performance, the integrated mainlobe-to-sidelobe ratio (IMSR) of
the beampattern is considered to ensure desirable directivity. Additionally, we
tackle the challenges of inter-block interference and eliminate the spurious
peaks, which are crucial for accurate target detection. Regarding the hardware
implementation aspect, the power of each time sample is constrained to manage
the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The design problem is addressed using
an alternating optimization (AO) framework, with the subproblem for transmitted
waveform design being solved via the successive convex approximation (SCA)
method. To further enhance computational efficiency, the alternate direction
penalty method (ADPM) is employed to solve the subproblems within the SCA
iterations. The convergence of ADPM is established, with convergence of the
case of more than two auxiliary variables being established for the first time.
Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our transceiver design in
achieving desirable performance in both radar sensing and communication, with
the fast algorithm achieving comparable performance with greater computational
efficiency.

### [6] [Second Order Channel Statistics: An Analysis for Optimal Single-user RIS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10476)
*Amy S. Inwood,Peter J. Smith,Philippa A. Martin,Graeme K. Woodward*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了可重构智能表面（RIS）系统中信道状态信息获取的挑战，通过二阶统计方法分析了单用户RIS系统的时空行为，推导了信号衰落率和平均衰落持续时间等关键指标，并通过仿真验证了分析结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 被动式RIS无法生成导频信号或处理数据，导致信道快速变化的问题未被充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用二阶统计方法分析单用户RIS系统的时空行为，推导了信号衰落率（LCR）和平均衰落持续时间（AFD）的精确表达式，并提出了数值稳定的近似方法。

Result: 仿真验证了分析结果，显示RIS的使用不会显著放大信道的变化。

Conclusion: 研究表明RIS对信道变化的放大效应有限，为RIS系统的实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: A key challenge facing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is channel
state information acquisition. Passive RISs cannot generate pilot signals or
process data, making rapid temporal changes in the channel problematic.
Additionally, the impact of spatial changes in RIS channels has not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, in this work, we use second order
statistics to investigate the spatio-temporal behaviour of a single-user (SU)
RIS system. Assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) RIS to base station (BS) link, we
derive an exact expression for the level crossing rate (LCR) of the RIS link
(user equipment (UE)-RIS-BS path) and propose a numerically stable
approximation for the LCR of the global UE-BS channel. Each LCR expression
attained is then utilised to find the corresponding average fade duration
(AFD). The temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) correlation is also derived
assuming an LoS RIS-BS link. Assuming a Ricean RIS-BS link, expressions for the
spatial correlation matrix of the global channel and the mean SNR loss due to
channel ageing are derived. All of the analyses are verified by simulation, and
the impact of key system parameters is investigated. We show that the use of an
RIS does not significantly amplify changes in the channel.

Abstract: We consider a single-user (SU) continuous fluid antenna system (CFAS)
employing matched filtering (MF) operating over a Ricean fading channel.
Focusing on the upper tail of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
distribution (the high SNR probability (HSP)), we derive accurate
approximations for the HSP in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions using the expected Euler
characteristic (EEC), presenting the first analytical results for a CFAS in a
Ricean environment. In the process, we provide the first closed-form expression
for the Euler characteristic density of a non-central chi-squared random field.
We then examine the impact of the Ricean K-factor on the CFAS performance,
emphasizing the critical role of channel variations in achieving a strong HSP.

Motivation: 探索不同方法在雷达截面积测量中的优缺点，以提高数据分析的准确性和适用性。

Method: 比较后向投影和迭代平滑重加权ℓ1最小化两种方法。

Result: 后向投影稳健准确但分辨率有限，迭代方法适用于密集散射体但精度较低。

Conclusion: 后向投影更适合一般情况，迭代方法适用于特定场景但需权衡精度。

Abstract: Radar Cross Section measurement data is often analyzed using Inverse
Synthetic Aperture Radar images. This paper compares backprojection and
iterative smooth reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization as methods to analyze radar
cross section measurements and extract radar cross section for parts of the
measured object. The main conclusion is that using backprojection images to
extract RCS is robust and accurate but is more limited by the resolution than
iterative smooth reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization. The latter method can be
used for closely spaced scatterers but is limited in accuracy.

### [9] [Unsupervised Deep Equilibrium Model Learning for Large-Scale Channel Estimation with Performance Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10546)

Conclusion: 该框架为无监督信道估计提供了理论和实践基础，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning methods have shown promise for large-scale channel
estimation (LCE), but their reliance on ground-truth channel labels greatly
limits their practicality in real-world systems. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised learning framework for LCE that does not require ground-truth
channels. The proposed approach leverages Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk
Estimate (GSURE) as a principled unsupervised loss function, which provides an
unbiased estimate of the projected mean-squared error (PMSE) from compressed
noisy measurements. To ensure a guaranteed performance, we integrate a deep
equilibrium (DEQ) model, which implicitly represents an infinite-depth network
by directly learning the fixed point of a parameterized iterative process. We
theoretically prove that, under mild conditions, the proposed GSURE-based
unsupervised DEQ learning can achieve oracle-level supervised performance. In
particular, we show that the DEQ architecture inherently enforces a
compressible solution. We then demonstrate that DEQ-induced compressibility
ensures that optimizing the projected error via GSURE suffices to guarantee a
good MSE performance, enabling a rigorous performance guarantee. Extensive
simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly outperforms various baselines when ground-truth channel
is unavailable.

Result: 研究表明，利用折射透镜的色差特性可以有效替代昂贵的衍射透镜。

Conclusion: 该方法为压缩光谱成像提供了一种更经济、紧凑的替代方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Earth observation from space is an important scientific and industrial
activity that has applications in many sectors. The instruments employed are
often large, complex, and expensive. In addition, they generate large amounts
of data, which is challenging for storage and transfer purposes. Compressive
spectral imaging would be a cheaper, more efficient, and well-adapted technique
to perform Earth observation. An interesting architecture is compressive
spectral imaging with diffractive lenses, which is extremely compact. This work
investigates the possibility of replacing the diffractive lens in this system
with a classical refractive lens. Taking advantage of the chromatic aberration
of a lens makes the use of expensive diffractive lenses unnecessary.
Simulations are performed to test the feasibility of the method. Signal
recovery is a basis pursuit solved using the Douglas-Rashford algorithm.

Conclusion: 混合PNT系统在月球任务中提供了更鲁棒的导航性能，尤其是在参考站辅助下，展示了其在未来任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) are crucial for upcoming
lunar surface missions. Lunar satellite navigation systems are being developed,
but lack coverage during early deployment phases. Hybrid lunar PNT combining
cooperative navigation, satellite systems, and an optional reference station
offers improved accuracy and availability. This study develops realistic error
models that incorporate temporal correlations often ignored in existing works.
We derive a cooperative navigation error model considering fading and
pseudorange bias from multipath propagation, and compare three error models for
lunar satellite pseudorange and pseudorange rate signal-in-space error. These
temporal error correlation models integrate easily into Kalman filters and
provide realistic performance predictions essential for robust navigation
engines. We perform case studies to demonstrate that hybrid navigation
significantly improves accuracy, particularly with static users present. Most
notably, hybrid navigation enables optimal performance when using a lunar
reference station, achieving sub-meter accuracy with only two visible
satellites.

Method: 采用子载波功率水平索引调制（PLIM），提出低复杂度估计器和子载波分组以减少计算复杂度。同时研究了AFDM-PLIM的延迟和多普勒模糊函数。

Result: AFDM-PLIM在频谱效率和传感性能上优于传统的AFDM-IM波形，特别是在范围估计方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: AFDM-PLIM技术为ISAC系统提供了一种高效的解决方案，兼具高频谱效率和优异的传感性能。

Abstract: This study proposes an index modulation (IM) technique for affine frequency
division multiplexing (AFDM) signals and examines its communication and sensing
performance toward integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The
power levels of subcarriers are utilized as modulation indices while also
transmitting data symbols within each subcarrier. Thus, the proposed AFDM with
subcarrier power-level index modulation (AFDM-PLIM) maintains all subcarriers
active at all times to achieve a higher spectral efficiency compared to other
AFDM-IM techniques, where some of the subcarriers are turned off for IM. A low
complexity estimator and subcarrier grouping are also proposed to reduce the
computational complexity of the maximum likelihood estimator. Furthermore, this
study also examines the delay and Doppler ambiguity functions of the proposed
AFDM-PLIM and evaluates its range estimation performance. The results show that
its sensing performance is better than AFDM-IM waveforms due to keeping all
subcarriers active at all times.

Abstract: Objective. Wearable devices with embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) enable
continuous non-invasive monitoring of cardiac activity, offering a promising
strategy to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. However,
monitoring during daily life introduces motion artifacts that can compromise
the signals. Traditional signal decomposition techniques often fail with severe
artifacts. Deep learning denoisers are more effective but have poorer
interpretability, which is critical for clinical acceptance. This study
proposes a framework that combines the advantages of both signal decomposition
and deep learning approaches. Approach. We leverage algorithm unfolding to
integrate prior knowledge about the PPG structure into a deep neural network,
improving its interpretability. A learned convolutional sparse coding model
encodes the signal into a sparse representation using a learned dictionary of
kernels that capture recurrent morphological patterns. The network is trained
for denoising using the PulseDB dataset and a synthetic motion artifact model
from the literature. Performance is benchmarked with PPG during daily
activities using the PPG-DaLiA dataset and compared with two reference deep
learning methods. Main results. On the synthetic dataset, the proposed method,
on average, improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from -7.07 dB to 11.23 dB
and reduced the heart rate mean absolute error (MAE) by 55%. On the PPG-DaLiA
dataset, the MAE decreased by 23%. The proposed method obtained higher SNR and
comparable MAE to the reference methods. Significance. Our method effectively
enhances the quality of PPG signals from wearable devices and enables the
extraction of meaningful waveform features, which may inspire innovative tools
for monitoring cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Fluid antenna (FA) technology has emerged as a promising approach in wireless
communications due to its capability of providing increased degrees of freedom
(DoFs) and exceptional design flexibility. This paper addresses the challenge
of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for aligned received signals (ARS) and
non-aligned received signals (NARS) by designing two specialized uniform FA
structures under time-constrained mobility. For ARS scenarios, we propose a
fully movable antenna configuration that maximizes the virtual array aperture,
whereas for NARS scenarios, we design a structure incorporating a fixed
reference antenna to reliably extract phase information from the signal
covariance. To overcome the limitations of large virtual arrays and limited
sample data inherent in time-varying channels (TVC), we introduce two novel DOA
estimation methods: TMRLS-MUSIC for ARS, combining Toeplitz matrix
reconstruction (TMR) with linear shrinkage (LS) estimation, and TMR-MUSIC for
NARS, utilizing sub-covariance matrices to construct virtual array responses.
Both methods employ Nystrom approximation to significantly reduce computational
complexity while maintaining estimation accuracy. Theoretical analyses and
extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
underdetermined DOA estimation using minimal FA elements, outperform
conventional methods in estimation accuracy, and substantially reduce
computational complexity.

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的FA设计显著扩展了自由度范围，提升了DOA估计的精度，并在多种信号条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAS通过硬件创新简化了复杂算法问题，不仅扩展了空间自由度，还显著提升了DOA估计的性能，适用于毫米波环境。

Abstract: This paper investigates a design framework for sparse fluid antenna systems
(FAS) enabling high-performance direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation,
particularly in challenging millimeter-wave (mmWave) environments. By
ingeniously harnessing the mobility of fluid antenna (FA) elements, the
proposed architectures achieve an extended range of spatial degrees of freedom
(DoF) compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays. This
innovation not only facilitates the seamless application of super-resolution
DOA estimators but also enables robust DOA estimation, accurately localizing
more sources than the number of physical antenna elements. We introduce two
bespoke FA array structures and mobility strategies tailored to scenarios with
aligned and misaligned received signals, respectively, demonstrating a
hardware-driven approach to overcoming complexities typically addressed by
intricate algorithms. A key contribution is a light-of-sight (LoS)-centric,
closed-form DOA estimator, which first employs an eigenvalue-ratio test for
precise LoS path number detection, followed by a polynomial root-finding
procedure. This method distinctly showcases the unique advantages of FAS by
simplifying the estimation process while enhancing accuracy. Numerical results
compellingly verify that the proposed FA array designs and estimation
techniques yield an extended DoF range, deliver superior DOA accuracy, and
maintain robustness across diverse signal conditions.

Conclusion: SFAS为阵列源定位提供了新范式，无需场特定假设即可实现高精度定位。

Abstract: Most existing antenna array-based source localization methods rely on
fixed-position arrays (FPAs) and strict assumptions about source field
conditions (near-field or far-field), which limits their effectiveness in
complex, dynamic real-world scenarios where high-precision localization is
required. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel scalable fluid antenna
system (SFAS) that can dynamically adjust its aperture configuration to
optimize performance for different localization tasks. Within this framework,
we develop a two-stage source localization strategy based on the exact spatial
geometry (ESG) model: the first stage uses a compact aperture configuration for
initial direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, while the second stage employs
an expanded aperture for enhanced DOA and range estimation. The proposed
approach eliminates the traditional need for signal separation or isolation to
classify source types and enables a single SFAS array to achieve high
localization accuracy without field-specific assumptions, model
simplifications, or approximations, representing a new paradigm in array-based
source localization. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method in terms of localization accuracy, computational efficiency,
and robustness to different source types.

Abstract: Air-based molecular communication (MC) has the potential to be one of the
first MC systems to be deployed in real-world applications, enabled by existing
sensor technologies such as metal-oxide semi-conductor (MOS) sensors. However,
commercially available sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive
behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumptions about linear and perfectly
molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this
gap, we propose a detector for molecule mixture communication with a general
non-linear, cross-reactive receiver (RX) array that performs approximate
maximum likelihood detection on the sensor outputs. Additionally, we introduce
an algorithm for the design of mixture alphabets that accounts for the RX
characteristics. We evaluate our detector and alphabet design algorithm through
simulations that are based on measurements reported for two commercial MOS
sensors. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves
similar symbol error rates as data-driven methods without requiring large
numbers of training samples and that the alphabet design algorithm outperforms
methods that do not account for the RX characteristics. Since the proposed
detector and alphabet design algorithm are also applicable to other chemical
sensors, they pave the way for reliable air-based MC.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决情感计算中将主观情绪体验与客观生理标志物相关联时的可重复性问题。

Method: 使用持续注释情感数据集，分析了30名参与者暴露于情绪诱发视频时的164个心血管和皮肤电信号特征，并采用T-Rex方法进行特征选择。

Result: 在所有候选特征中，仅两个皮肤电特征表现出与唤醒水平的可重复且统计学显著的关联，确认率达100%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了生理特征选择中严格的可重复性评估的重要性，对安全关键环境中的可信赖模型应用具有潜力。

Abstract: In Affective Computing, a key challenge lies in reliably linking subjective
emotional experiences with objective physiological markers. This preliminary
study addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological
features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with
continuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated
Signal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and
electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking
videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random
Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically
controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all
candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited
reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving
a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous
reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect
often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising
for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and
reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot
interaction systems.

Motivation: 虚拟现实中个人空间侵犯的生理反应和表情调节效应尚未充分研究，需进一步探索。

Method: 采用2x2因子设计，记录皮肤电反应、心率变异性和不适评分，分析空间侵犯和表情的影响。

Result: 站立阶段的SCR反应更强，愤怒表情降低HRV并增加不适感，但未增强SCR。

Conclusion: 不同生理指标反映不同的空间行为反应，结果有助于设计更真实的虚拟社交互动。

Abstract: Proxemics, the study of spatial behavior, is fundamental to social
interaction and increasingly relevant for virtual reality (VR) applications.
While previous research has established that users respond to personal space
violations in VR similarly as in real-world settings, phase-specific
physiological responses and the modulating effects of facial expressions remain
understudied. We investigated physiological and subjective responses to
personal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening
facial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence
these responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2x2 factorial design
manipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression
(neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart
rate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were
individually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR
responses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the
approach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged
proximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing
than the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV,
reflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort
ratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that
different physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic
responses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV
responds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing
comprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual
environments and inform the design of more realistic avatar interactions.

Motivation: 当前CV-QKD协议假设参考脉冲与量子信号的波前畸变相同，但实际部署中存在相对波前误差，严重影响安全密钥传输。

Method: 使用机器学习算法和多平面光转换，将波前分解为HG基，估计模式相位差以校正误差。

Result: 通过模拟验证，算法能快速识别并补偿相对波前误差，在特定信道中实现正安全密钥率。

Conclusion: 新算法有效解决了波前误差问题，为卫星至地面CV-QKD提供了更高效的密钥传输方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution
(CV-QKD) protocols use phase reference pulses to modulate the wavefront of a
real local oscillator at the receiver, thereby compensating for wavefront
distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence. It is normally assumed that the
wavefront distortion in these phase reference pulses is identical to the
wavefront distortion in the quantum signals, which are multiplexed during
transmission. However, in many real-world deployments, there can exist a
relative wavefront error (WFE) between the reference pulses and quantum
signals, which, among other deleterious effects, can severely limit secure key
transfer in satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD. In this work, we introduce novel machine
learning-based wavefront correction algorithms, which utilize multi-plane light
conversion for decomposition of the reference pulses and quantum signals into
the Hermite-Gaussian (HG) basis, then estimate the difference in HG mode phase
measurements, effectively eliminating this problem. Through detailed
simulations of the Earth-satellite channel, we demonstrate that our new
algorithm can rapidly identify and compensate for any relative WFEs that may
exist, whilst causing no harm when WFEs are similar across both the reference
pulses and quantum signals. We quantify the gains available in our algorithm in
terms of the CV-QKD secure key rate. We show channels where positive secure key
rates are obtained using our algorithms, while information loss without
wavefront correction would result in null key rates.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound provides enhanced visualization of the
carotid artery (CA) anatomy and volumetric flow, offering improved accuracy for
cardiovascular diagnosis and monitoring. However, fully populated matrix
transducers with large apertures are complex and costly to implement.
Computational ultrasound imaging (cUSi) offers a promising alternative by
enabling simplified hardware design through model-based reconstruction and
spatial field encoding. In this work, we present a 3D cUSi system tailored for
CA imaging, consisting of a 240-element matrix probe with a 40 x 24 mm$^2$
large aperture and a spatial encoding mask. We describe the system's design,
characterization, and image reconstruction. Phantom experiments show that
computational reconstruction using matched filtering (MF) significantly
improves volumetric image quality over delay-and-sum (DAS), with spatial
encoding enhancing lateral resolution at the cost of reduced contrast ratio.
LSQR-based reconstruction was demonstrated to further improve resolution and
suppress artifacts. Using both Hadamard and 16-angle plane wave transmission
schemes, the system achieved high-resolution images with reasonable contrast,
supporting the feasibility of 4D CA imaging applications.

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Abstract: The evolution of Internet of Things technologies is driven by four key
demands: ultra-low power consumption, high spectral efficiency, reduced
implementation cost, and support for massive connectivity. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes two novel modulation schemes that integrate
continuous phase modulation (CPM) with spread spectrum (SS) techniques. We
begin by establishing the quasi-orthogonality properties of CPM-SS sequences.
The first scheme, termed IM-CPM-SS, employs index modulation (IM) to select
spreading sequences from the CPM-SS set, thereby improving spectral efficiency
while maintaining the constant-envelope property. The second scheme, referred
to as CIM-CPM-SS, introduces code index modulation (CIM), which partitions the
input bits such that one subset is mapped to phase-shift keying symbols and the
other to CPM-SS sequence indices. Both schemes are applied to downlink
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. We analyze their performance in
terms of bit error rate (BER), spectral and energy efficiency, computational
complexity, and peak-to-average power ratio characteristics under nonlinear
amplifier conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that both schemes
outperform conventional approaches in BER while preserving the benefits of
constant-envelope, continuous-phase signaling. Furthermore, they achieve higher
spectral and energy efficiency and exhibit strong resilience to nonlinear
distortions in downlink NOMA scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the integration of communication and synthetic
aperture radar (SAR)-based remote sensing in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite
systems to provide real-time SAR imaging and information transmission.
Considering the high-mobility characteristics of satellite channels and limited
processing capabilities of satellite payloads, we propose an integrated
communication and remote sensing architecture based on an orthogonal
delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) signal waveform. Both communication
and SAR imaging functionalities are achieved with an integrated transceiver
onboard the LEO satellite, utilizing the same waveform and radio frequency (RF)
front-end. Based on such an architecture, we propose a transmission protocol
compatible with the 5G NR standard using downlink pilots for joint channel
estimation and SAR imaging. Furthermore, we design a unified signal processing
framework for the integrated satellite receiver to simultaneously achieve
high-performance channel sensing, low-complexity channel equalization and
interference-free SAR imaging. Finally, the performance of the proposed
integrated system is demonstrated through comprehensive analysis and extensive
simulations in the sub-6 GHz band. Moreover, a software-defined radio (SDR)
prototype is presented to validate its effectiveness for real-time SAR imaging
and information transmission in satellite direct-connect user equipment (UE)
scenarios within the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band.
