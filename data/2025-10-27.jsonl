Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold\ndetectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often\nlarge amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort\ncomplex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study\nexplores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale\napplications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be\nanalyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying\ndynamics.\n  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two\nsingle-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it\nboth in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated\nand real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the\nproposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection\ncompared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is\nfurther improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while\noutperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based\ndetection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal\nidentification, with potential applications in various disciplines."}

Despite extensive recent advances in\nidentifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between\ntheory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap\nby bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,\nthis paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of\nposition and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose\nEstimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES\nembodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative\nfactors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic\nlatent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,\nand camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the\ncontrollable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated\n(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that\nvariables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In\nrobotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various\njoints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in\nsemi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully\ndisentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the\nground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional\nchanges, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison\nwith a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework.

We build on our previous hardware-agnostic actuator\nsynchronization in Motion Stack to develop a new controller enforcing adaptive\nvelocity bounds via a dynamic hypersphere clamp. Using only real-time\nend-effector and target pose measurements, the controller adjusts its\ntranslational and rotational speed limits to ensure smooth, stable alignment\nwithout abrupt motions. We implemented two variants, a discrete, step-based\nversion and a continuous, velocity-based version, and tested them on two\nMoonBot limbs in JAXA's lunar environment simulator. Field trials demonstrate\nthat the step-based variant produces highly predictable, low-wobble motions,\nwhile the continuous variant converges more quickly and maintains\nmillimeter-level positional accuracy, and both remain robust across limbs with\ndiffering mechanical imperfections and sensing noise (e.g., backlash and flex).\nThese results highlight the flexibility and robustness of our robot-agnostic\nframework for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh\nconditions."}
