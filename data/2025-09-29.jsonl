We derive sufficient conditions that lead, on the one hand,\nto finite hyperparameter estimates and, on the other, to infinite ones.\nFinally, we show that in the Gaussian case, the two conditions are\ncomplementary and coincide with the pruning condition of fast SBL (F-SBL),\nthereby providing additional insights into this algorithm."}

To\ninform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative\nto understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially\nfor traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that\nlegged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively\ndetect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain\nproperties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling\nspeed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This\npaper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on\nproprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a\nsensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,\nTrot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of\ndeformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory\ntransect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with\nsynthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the\nsensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can\nmeasure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration\nresistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the\nlocomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in\nmeasurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of\nthe surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot\ngait. Our results offer new insights that inform legged robot \"sensing during\nlocomotion\" gait design and planning for scouting the terrain and producing\nscientific measurements on other worlds to advance our understanding of their\ngeology and formation."}

Second, we apply\nVision-Language-Action(VLA) models to underwater robotics for the first time,\nincorporating structured chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable\ndecision-making. Third, a hydrodynamics-informed Model Predictive Control(MPC)\nscheme compensates for fluid effects in real time without costly task-specific\ntraining. Experimental results in field tests show that UnderwaterVLA reduces\nnavigation errors in degraded visual conditions while maintaining higher task\ncompletion by 19% to 27% over baseline. By minimizing reliance on\nunderwater-specific training data and improving adaptability across\nenvironments, UnderwaterVLA provides a scalable and cost-effective path toward\nthe next generation of intelligent AUVs."}

Cobots, as cyber-physical systems, enable the\nintroduction of lightweight automation to smaller companies through their\nflexibility, low cost and ability to work alongside humans, while keeping\nhumans and their skills in the loop. Industry 5.0, the evolution of Industry\n4.0, places the worker at the centre of its principles: The physical and mental\nwell-being of the worker is the main goal of new technology design, not just\nproductivity, efficiency and safety standards. Within this concept, human trust\nin cobots and human autonomy are important. While trust is essential for\neffective and smooth interaction, the workers' perception of autonomy is key to\nintrinsic motivation and overall well-being. As failures are an inevitable part\nof technological systems, this study aims to answer the question of how system\nfailures affect trust in cobots as well as human autonomy, and how they can be\nrecovered afterwards. Therefore, a VR experiment (n = 39) was set up to\ninvestigate the influence of a cobot failure and its severity on human autonomy\nand trust in the cobot. Furthermore, the influence of transparent communication\nabout the failure and next steps was investigated. The results show that both\ntrust and autonomy suffer after cobot failures, with the severity of the\nfailure having a stronger negative impact on trust, but not on autonomy. Both\ntrust and autonomy can be partially restored by transparent communication."}

However, discrepancies between simulated and real-world behavior,\nknown as the reality gap, challenge the transferability of test results to\ndeployed systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study\ncomparing four representative testing modalities: Software-in-the-Loop (SiL),\nVehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL), Mixed-Reality (MR), and full real-world testing.\nUsing a small-scale physical vehicle equipped with real sensors (camera and\nLiDAR) and its digital twin, we implement each setup and evaluate two ADS\narchitectures (modular and end-to-end) across diverse indoor driving scenarios\ninvolving real obstacles, road topologies, and indoor environments. We\nsystematically assess the impact of each testing modality along three\ndimensions of the reality gap: actuation, perception, and behavioral fidelity.\nOur results show that while SiL and ViL setups simplify critical aspects of\nreal-world dynamics and sensing, MR testing improves perceptual realism without\ncompromising safety or control. Importantly, we identify the conditions under\nwhich failures do not transfer across testing modalities and isolate the\nunderlying dimensions of the gap responsible for these discrepancies. Our\nfindings offer actionable insights into the respective strengths and\nlimitations of each modality and outline a path toward more robust and\ntransferable validation of autonomous driving systems."}

In simulated environments, rewards are\nconventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,\nsuch precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual\nsettings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a\nmethod that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted\nfrom images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation\nModel (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured\nrewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an\nanticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate\nkeypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a\nstructured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric\nobjectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is\nprovided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical\nreinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.\nExtensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that\nReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods."}

However, collecting large-scale\nreal-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and\nenvironmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To\novercome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation\n(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data\nengine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a\ndiffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,\ngeometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables\ntext-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,\nbackground, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or\ngeometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and\ngenerated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy\nthat dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on\nperceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show\nthat videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video\ngeneration methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and\ntext-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable\nrobots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using\nonly demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic\nmanipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a\n200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and\nfurther improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nboosting policy generalization."}

Existing methods like the mixture of experts\nand skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share\nsignificant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal\nstates between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy\nintegration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor\nskills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states.\nBased on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless\nand robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set\nof fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions.

Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic\nunderstanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods\ntypically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive\nmaps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from\nspatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which\nimpede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in\nhuman navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the\nright brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework\nfeaturing a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and\nvisual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural\nrepresentations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior\nknowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the\nhistorical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic\nencoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs\nof tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,\nenabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nJanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For\nexample, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using\nmultiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB\ntraining data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as\na novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.\nOurs project page: https://miv-xjtu.github.io/JanusVLN.github.io/."}
