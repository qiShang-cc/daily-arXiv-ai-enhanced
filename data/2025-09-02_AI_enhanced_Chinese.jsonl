We consider a multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station\nserves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability\nparadigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired\nbeampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state\nselection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set\nof patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM\nprecoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case\nwe derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM\nprecoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and\npropose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern\nselection.

Using this framework, we conduct a fair and\ncomprehensive comparative study of these waveforms under DS-spread UWA channels\nand similar receiver complexities.\n  We also develop a novel iterative variational Bayesian (VB) off-grid CE\nalgorithm to estimate the delay and scale parameters of the channel paths, via\ntwo approaches: a first-order approximation scheme (FVB) and a second-order\napproximation scheme (SVB). We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol\ndetection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios\nfor the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED)\nscheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \\emph{virtual} pilots to further\nimprove the CE and data detection accuracy.\n  Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE\nand data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in\nuncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier\nequalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while\nOFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS\nperform similarly, and they outperform OFDM. With coded communications,\ninterestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver\nis employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is\nconstrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel\nconditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these\ndifferences disappear.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u5b66\u901a\u4fe1\u63a5\u6536\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6269\u6563\u4fe1\u9053\uff08DS-spread\uff09\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08CE\uff09\u548c\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8c03\u5236\u6ce2\u5f62\uff08OFDM\u3001OTFS\u3001OCDM\u3001ODSS\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u53d8\u5206\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce2\u5f62\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u6ce2\u5f62\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u800c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7b97\u6cd5\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u5b66\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6269\u6563\u4fe1\u9053\uff08DS-spread\uff09\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u6ce2\u5f62\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u9053\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u63a5\u6536\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301OFDM\u3001OTFS\u3001OCDM\u3001ODSS\u8c03\u5236\u6ce2\u5f62\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u53d8\u5206\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u79bb\u683cCE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08FVB\u548cSVB\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d8\u5206\u8f6f\u7b26\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08VSSD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u8f85\u52a9\u8fed\u4ee3CE\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08ICED\uff09\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u672a\u7f16\u7801\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\uff0cODSS\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\uff0cOFDM\u6700\u5dee\uff1b\u7f16\u7801\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528VSSD\u540e\u5404\u6ce2\u5f62\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u6ce2\u5f62\u9009\u62e9\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ce2\u5f62\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u3002\u800c\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u7b97\u6cd5\u540e\uff0c\u5404\u6ce2\u5f62\u6027\u80fd\u8d8b\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for\nopen-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of\nlong-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This\npaper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of\nEO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for\ndeveloping advanced embodied foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EO-Robotics\uff08\u5305\u62ecEO-1\u6a21\u578b\u548cEO-Data1.5M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6EO-Data1.5M\uff08150\u4e07\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u53bb\u566a\u8bad\u7ec3EO-1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eEO-1\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u957f\u89c6\u57df\u548c\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "EO-1\u4e0eEO-Data1.5M\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5177\u8eab\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked\nto navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to\ntargets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead\nto deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only\nprovides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees\nnon-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of\ninterest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\\times K}$ cost structure that\ndescribes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another.

We formulate a joint clustering and\nradio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received\npower across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem\ninto two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on\ntheir spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii)\nantenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio\nstripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex\napproximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are\nshape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either\nstraight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical\nresults show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with\nChebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The\noptimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide\nrange of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped\ndeployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches.

The method samples with Sobol sequences around the prior\ninput and incorporates analytical solutions for collision avoidance. By\nleveraging multiple modes, the multi-modal control algorithm explores diverse\ntrajectories, such as manoeuvring around obstacles or stopping safely before\nthem, mitigating the risk of sub-optimal solutions. A non-linear single-track\nvehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force\nconstraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability\nduring evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal\nacceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to\ncontrol the vehicle. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the\nvehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre on high and\nlow-friction road surfaces and occlusion scenarios with moving obstacles,\noutperforming a standard Model Predictive Path Integral approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Sobol\u5e8f\u5217\u91c7\u6837\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u907f\u969c\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u907f\u969c\u6216\u7d27\u6025\u505c\u8f66\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u8f66\u8f86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Sobol\u5e8f\u5217\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5355\u8f68\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\u548cFiala\u8f6e\u80ce\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6469\u64e6\u5706\u5185\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6e\u80ce\u529b\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u53cc\u8f66\u9053\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u9ad8\u4f4e\u6469\u64e6\u8def\u9762\u53ca\u79fb\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u7269\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u907f\u969c\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u907f\u969c\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code\nrequired to control the robot.

In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to\ndrive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy\ncode generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to\nunveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled\nrobotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation\ntask and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive\nexperiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in\ntwo prominent frameworks.

This provides an interesting use\ncase to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in\nthe vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation\nbased on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how\npedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into\nthe implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and\nacceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,\na model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction\n(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,\nit is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and\ndecision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used\nframework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept\nfor an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model\nto learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL\nagent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a\nrisk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model\nlearned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and\nthereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the\nmodelled pedestrian.

It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and\ncorrelate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the\nsearch space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby\naffecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search\nusing several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in\nMulti-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible\nheuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original\nversion does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm\nthat requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time\nsolution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime\nversion that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually\nimproves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime\nRepairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*\nconcepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and\ncompleteness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.\nFurthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain\nand sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06MHA*\u6269\u5c55\u4e3aAnytime\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u627e\u5230\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539fMHA*\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "MHA*\u867d\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53ef\u91c7\u7eb3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u52a0\u901f\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274ARA*\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06MHA*\u6269\u5c55\u4e3aAnytime\u7248\u672c\uff08A-MHA*\uff09\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u539fMHA*\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6ed1\u52a8\u62fc\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cA-MHA*\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eMHA*\u548c\u5176\u4ed6Anytime\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "A-MHA*\u6210\u529f\u7ee7\u627fMHA*\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u521d\u59cb\u89e3\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, standard gradient\nguidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward\nlandscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios\ninvolving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and\nmulti-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches\nrequire task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time\nflexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion\nPlanner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances\nexploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame\ntest-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:\n(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle\nguidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined\nthrough fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the\nlimitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and\nharnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only\npretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three\ndiverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze\nmulti-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches on all tasks.
