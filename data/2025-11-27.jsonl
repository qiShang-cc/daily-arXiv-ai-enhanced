During the sensing process, obtaining target direction information can provide valuable contextual insights for various applications. Existing direction estimation methods typically rely on antenna arrays, which are costly and complex to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present WiRainbow, a novel approach that enables single-antenna-based direction awareness for Wi-Fi sensing by leveraging the dispersion effect of frequency-scanning antennas (FSAs), which can naturally steer Wi-Fi subcarriers toward distinct angles during signal transmission. To address key challenges in antenna design and signal processing, we propose a coupled-resonator-based antenna architecture that significantly expands the narrow Field-of-View inherent in conventional FSAs, improving sensing coverage. Additionally, we develop a sensing signal-to-noise-ratio-based signal processing framework that reliably estimates target direction in multipath-rich environments. We prototype WiRainbow and evaluate its performance through benchmark experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating its ability to achieve accurate, robust, and cost-effective direction awareness for diverse Wi-Fi sensing applications."}

To enhance feature relevance, the proposed framework integrates multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) to isolate fault-relevant components before applying FM-MFDFA.

Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness."}

Hence in this paper, a series of experiments are conducted in order to understand and characterize the system behavior and compare a general thermistor and a modified thermistor as a potential method of temperature measurement for outdoor usage of prostheses. The paper goes on to compare the different modified thermistors behavior with their regular counterpart and highlights the challenges and improvement areas needed for such a modified thermistor for outdoor temperature monitoring in a prosthetic system. Initial results show that some of the modified thermistors showed better temperature recording compared to the rest.

We introduce OVAL-Grasp, a zero-shot open-vocabulary approach to task-oriented, affordance based grasping that uses large-language models and vision-language models to allow a robot to grasp objects at the correct part according to a given task. Given an RGB image and a task, OVAL-Grasp identifies parts to grasp or avoid with an LLM, segments them with a VLM, and generates a 2D heatmap of actionable regions on the object. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed two task oriented grasping baselines on experiments with 20 household objects with 3 unique tasks for each. OVAL-Grasp successfully identifies and segments the correct object part 95% of the time and grasps the correct actionable area 78.3% of the time in real-world experiments with the Fetch mobile manipulator. Additionally, OVAL-Grasp finds correct object parts under partial occlusions, demonstrating a part selection success rate of 80% in cluttered scenes.

Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability.

Sparse array technique using stochastic optimization methods is one of promising techniques to reduce channel counts while due to the stochastic nature of these methods, the optimized results are usually unstable. In this work, we introduce a sparse array design approach that formulates the synthesis problem of sparse arrays as second-order cone programming (SOCP) and a re-weighted L1 technique is implemented to sequentially optimize the SOCP. Based on this method, an on-grid quasi-flatten side-lobe (Q-Flats) 2D sparse array with side-lobe level (SLL) no more than -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements is designed, which aims to achieve as high contrast performance as possible under the limits of resolution and maximum number of independent channels (i.e., 256). The imaging performance of the Q-Flats array was compared with those of a corresponding dense array (Dense), a Fermat spiral array (Spiral) and a spatially 50%-Tukey tapered spiral array (Spiral-Taper) using Field II simulations in a multi-angle steered diverging wave transmission scheme. It was demonstrated that the Dense achieved the best resolution and contrast and the Spiral-Taper the worst. The Q-Flats showed better resolution (about 3%) but slightly worse contrast than the Spiral. All the results indicate the re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible method for seeking trade-offs among resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements."}

MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies."}

Processing all features can introduce significant computational latency and inefficiency. This motivates the need for intelligent feature selection, identifying a subset of features that are most informative for localization over a prediction horizon. In this work, we propose two fast and memory-efficient feature selection algorithms that enable robots to actively evaluate the utility of visual features in real time. Unlike existing approaches with high computational and memory demands, the proposed methods are explicitly designed to reduce both time and memory complexity while achieving a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and localization accuracy."}

We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation.

To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations."}

To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines. By implementing adaptive computation within this framework, DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit."}

This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance.

Rather than removing VIBA altogether, we aim to reduce how often and how heavily it must be invoked. To this end, we cast two key design choices in modern VIO, when to run the visual frontend and how strongly to trust its output, as sequential decision problems, and solve them with lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our framework introduces a lightweight, dual-pronged RL policy that serves as our core contribution: (1) a Select Agent intelligently gates the entire VO pipeline based only on high-frequency IMU data; and (2) a composite Fusion Agent that first estimates a robust velocity state via a supervised network, before an RL policy adaptively fuses the full (p, v, q) state.

Additionally, an action remapping method is introduced to address sample sparsity issues caused by the strong nonlinearity in magnetic field intensity, hence allowing the DRL controller to converge. Experimental results demonstrate flexible manipulation capabilities, and notably, our system can generalize to transport tasks it has not been explicitly trained for. Furthermore, our approach can be scaled to manipulate heavier objects using larger electromagnets, offering a reference framework for industrial-scale robotic applications."}

Existing analyses often rely on Gaussian approximations and overlook fading effects, which limits their accuracy. This paper presents an accurate analytical framework for optimal bit detection in TNC systems under Rician fading. Using chi-squared statistics, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood detection threshold and an expression for the bit error probability (BEP) via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. The proposed model eliminates approximation errors and accurately characterizes performance for finite sample sizes. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the analytical results and demonstrate significant improvements in BEP compared with suboptimal Gaussian-based detection. Furthermore, the influence of key parameters, sample size, resistance ratio, and Rician K-factor, is quantified. The proposed framework provides a solid foundation for designing energy-efficient TNC receivers in future B5G/6G and large-scale IoT systems."}

Based on the principle of circular motion, the estimation accuracy is sensitive to nonlinear rotations of the reference platform, particularly under large inter-platform distances. This phenomenon is even obvious for linearized kinematics, because cumulative linearization errors significantly degrade precision. In virtual reality (VR) applications, this manifests as substantial positional errors in 6-DoF controller tracking during rapid rotations of the head-mounted display. The linearization errors introduce drift in the estimate and render the estimator inconsistent. In the field of odometry, IMU preintegration is proposed as a kinematic observation to enable efficient relinearization, thus mitigate linearized error. Building on this theory, we propose dual preintegration, a novel observation integrating IMU preintegration from both platforms. This method serves as kinematic constraints for consecutive relative state and supports efficient relinearization. We also perform observability analysis of the state and analytically formulate the accordingly null space. Algorithm evaluation encompasses both simulations and real-world experiments. Multiple nonlinear rotations on the reference platform are simulated to compare the precision of the proposed method with that of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. The field test compares the proposed method and SOTA algorithms in the application of VR controller tracking from the perspectives of bias observability, nonlinear rotation, and background texture. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more precise and robust than the SOTA algorithms."}

The proposed neural architecture consists of two cascaded networks: a convolutional encoder that compresses the input image into a low-dimensional latent vector, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron that approximates the corresponding spatial SDF. This latter network parametrizes an explicit position constraint used for collision avoidance, which is embedded in a velocity-tracking NMPC that outputs thrust and attitude commands to the robot.

Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning."}

MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes.

Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario.

We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Additionally, these technologies also provide opportunities to simultaneously detect HR and BR of multiple patients, which has become increasingly important for efficient mass monitoring scenarios. In this work, a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) mmWave radar based truly non-contact multiple patient HR and BR monitoring system has been presented. Furthermore, a novel approach is also proposed, which combines multiple processing methods using a least squares solution to improve measurement accuracy, generalization, and handle measurement error. The proposed system has been developed using Texas Instruments' FMCW radar and experimental results with multiple subjects are also presented, which show >97% and >93% accuracy in the measured BR and HR values, respectively."}

Traditional vital sign monitoring methods often face significant limitations, including subject discomfort with wearable devices, challenges in calibration, and the risk of infection transmission through contact measurement devices. To address these issues, this research is motivated by the need for versatile, non-contact vital monitoring solutions applicable in various critical scenarios. This work also explores the challenges of extending this capability to an arbitrary number of subjects, including hardware and theoretical limitations. Supported by rigorous experimental results and discussions, the paper illustrates the system's potential to redefine vital sign monitoring. An FPGA-based implementation is also presented as proof of concept for a hardware-based and portable solution, improving upon previous works by offering 2.7x faster execution and 18.4% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, as well as providing over 7400x acceleration compared to its software counterpart."}

Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training."}
