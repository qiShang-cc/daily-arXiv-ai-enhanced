Prior works have shown that timestamps form a\ndiscrete-time Markov chain, whose stationary distribution can be computed as\nthe leading left eigenvector of a large transition matrix. However,\nconstructing this matrix is known to be computationally expensive because of\nthe coupling between states and the dead time. This paper presents the first\nnon-sequential Markov modeling for the timestamp distribution. The key\ninnovation is an equivalent formulation that reparameterizes the integral\nbounds and separates the effect of dead time as a deterministic row permutation\nof a base matrix. This decoupling enables efficient vectorized matrix\nconstruction, yielding up to $1000 \\times$ acceleration over existing methods.\nThe new model produces a nearly exact stationary distribution when compared\nwith the gold standard Monte Carlo simulations, yet using a fraction of the\ntime.

Owing\nto their potential benefits, integrating PAs into wireless powered mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) systems is regarded as a viable solution to enhance both energy\ntransfer and task offloading efficiency. Unlike prior studies that assume ideal\ncontinuous PA placement along waveguides, this paper investigates a practical\ndiscrete PA-assisted wireless powered MEC framework, where devices first\nharvest energy from PA-emitted radio-frequency signals and then adopt a partial\noffloading mode, allocating part of the harvested energy to local computing and\nthe remainder to uplink offloading. The uplink phase considers both the\ntime-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA),\neach examined under three levels of PA activation flexibility. For each\nconfiguration, we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the total\ncomputational bits and conduct a theoretical performance comparison between the\nTDMA and NOMA schemes. To address the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear\nproblems, we develop a two-layer algorithm that combines closed-form solutions\nbased on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with a cross-entropy-based\nlearning method. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed\ndesign in terms of the harvested energy and computation performance, revealing\nthat TDMA and NOMA achieve comparable performance under coarser PA activation\nlevels, whereas finer activation granularity enables TDMA to achieve superior\ncomputation performance over NOMA."}

Existing approaches, such as gradient-based and heuristic\nalgorithms, often suffer from high computational complexity or undesired local\noptima. To address the above challenge, this letter proposes a general and\nlow-complexity optimization framework for MA position optimization.\nSpecifically, we discretize the antenna movement region into a set of sampling\npoints, thereby transforming the continuous optimization problem into a\ndiscrete point selection problem. Next, we sequentially update the optimal\nsampling point for each MA over multiple rounds. To avoid convergence to poor\nlocal optima, a Gibbs sampling (GS) phase is introduced between rounds to\nexplore adjacent and randomly generated candidate solutions.

Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered\nstaircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot\nthat pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable\nstance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,\nsuch as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be\ndifficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that\naddresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal\nrobot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during\nmanipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled\nperception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason\nabout feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core\ncontribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses\nproprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an\nobject's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the\nperception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,\nclosing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even\nafter partial pushes.

However, even\nwell-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich\nenvironments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through\nretraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned\nskills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent\nediting in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent\nActivation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies\nwithout modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two\nstages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect\nstates associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing\nmodule that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy\ntowards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in\nmulti-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal\nperception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through\na latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision\nactivations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.\nExtensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE\nachieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer\ncumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially\nincreases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task\ncompletion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,\nfeasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of\nlearned robot policies."}

This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it\nlimits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it\nmakes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both\nchallenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating\ncomplex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to\ngrasp an object.

Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety\nbenefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective\nevaluations.

Prior methods typically decompose the task into\ntwo independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that\nlimit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We\npropose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs\nin the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can\nbe enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier\nsignals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To\nthis end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware\nguidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are\nphysically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate\nDAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and\nlarge-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over\nprevious work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework\ngenerates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously\nunseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two\nmanipulators reliably grasp and lift them."}

First, we move\nbeyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable\nexternal dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a\ngeneralizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual\nNon-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the\nprevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to\nlearn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand\nmotion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and\nmorphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer\ndirectly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware\npost-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable\nmanipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns.
