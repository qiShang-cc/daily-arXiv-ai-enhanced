Timely prediction of agitation can enable\nearly intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life\nfor both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark\nmachine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in\ncommunity-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A\nnew set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was\nintroduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine\nlearning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem\nformulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular\nsensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly\ndetection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the\nTechnology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly\navailable dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,\ncomprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most\neffective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the\ncurrent 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.\nIncorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation\nhistory, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720\nand AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work\npresents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques\nfor agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using\nprivacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and\nefficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in\nplace."}

Recent\nadvancements in contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained models highlight the\npotential of exploiting the additional patient-level self-supervisory signals\ninherent in ECG. They are referred to as patient contrastive learning. Its\nrationale is that multiple physical recordings from the same patient may share\ncommonalities, termed patient consistency, so redefining positive and negative\npairs in contrastive learning as intrapatient and inter-patient samples\nprovides more shared context to learn an effective representation. However,\nthese methods still fail to efficiently exploit patient consistency due to the\ninsufficient amount of intra-inter patient samples existing in a batch.

Among all\nmeasures, physiological-signal-based drowsiness monitoring can be more\nprivacy-preserving than a camera-based approach. However, conflicts exist\nregarding how physiological metrics are associated with different drowsiness\nlabels across datasets. Thus, we analyzed key features from electrocardiograms\n(ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiratory (RESP) signals across four\ndatasets, where different drowsiness inducers (such as fatigue and low arousal)\nand assessment methods (subjective vs. objective) were used. Binary logistic\nregression models were built to identify the physiological metrics that are\nassociated with drowsiness. Findings indicate that distinct different\ndrowsiness inducers can lead to different physiological responses, and\nobjective assessments were more sensitive than subjective ones in detecting\ndrowsiness. Further, the increased heart rate stability, reduced respiratory\namplitude, and decreased tonic EDA are robustly associated with increased\ndrowsiness. The results enhance understanding of drowsiness detection and can\ninform future generalizable monitoring designs."}

Building on previous work using high-accuracy\nspectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multi-step ToA\nrefinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based\ntime-frequency coordination approach is demonstrated. By using a high-accuracy\ntime estimation approach, frequency estimates can be derived over long\nobservation intervals leading to a high-accuracy frequency estimate, without\nthe requirement for long pulse durations as is required for direct spectral\nfrequency estimation techniques, minimizing coordination overhead. Furthermore,\ndue to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and\nfrequency estimates are Doppler and multi-path tolerant, so long as the channel\nis reciprocal over the synchronization epoch.\n  This technique is experimentally verified by demonstrating wireless\ndistributed array coordination using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static\nand dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time,\nfrequency, and phase stability were measured over coaxial cables to an\noscilloscope and achieved time and phase coordination precision of ~60-70 ps,\nwith median coherent gains above 99% using optimized parameters, and a\nbeamforming frequency RMSE of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario. Finally,\nexperiments are conducted to compare the performance of this technique with\nprevious work works using an analog continuous-wave two-tone (CWTT) frequency\nreference technique in both static and dynamic settings as a benchmark."}

Specifically, time-frequency\n(TF) features of radar echoes are first extracted using both Short-Time Fourier\nTransform (STFT) and Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD). A\nfeature fusion method is then designed to effectively combine these two types\nof time-frequency representations. The fused TF features are further combined\nwith time-domain features of the radar echoes through a cross-modal fusion\nmodule based on an attention mechanism.

The key jamming parameters obtained by the\npassive radar provide essential information for intelligent decision-making,\nenabling the generation of more effective strategies tailored to specific\njamming types. The proposed method demonstrates improvements in both jamming\ntype recognition accuracy and the stability of anti-jamming strategy selection\nunder complex environments.

We introduce a diffusion-based reinforcement\nlearning (Diffusion-RL) algorithm designed to optimize the allocation of\nphysical resource blocks (PRBs) and power consumption, thereby maximizing\nweighted throughput and minimizing the delay for user equipment (UE). The\nDiffusion-RL model incorporates controlled noise and perturbations to explore\noptimal resource distribution while meeting each service type's Quality of\nService (QoS) requirements. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method\nagainst several benchmarks, including an exhaustive search algorithm, deep\nQ-networks (DQN), and the Semi-Supervised Variational Autoencoder (SS-VAE).\nComprehensive metrics, such as throughput and latency, are presented for each\nservice type. Experimental results demonstrate that the Diffusion-based RL\napproach outperforms existing methods in efficiency, scalability, and\nrobustness, offering a promising solution for resource allocation in dynamic\nand heterogeneous O-RAN environments with significant implications for future\n6G networks."}

However, their effectiveness depends\nheavily on the choice and initialization of the state matrix. In this work, we\nbuild on the SaFARi framework and existing WaLRUS SSMs to introduce a new\nvariant, W4S4 (WaLRUS for S4), a new class of SSMs constructed from redundant\nwavelet frames. WaLRUS admits a stable diagonalization and supports fast kernel\ncomputation without requiring low-rank approximations, making it both\ntheoretically grounded and computationally efficient. We show that WaLRUS\nretains information over long horizons significantly better than HiPPO-based\nSSMs, both in isolation and when integrated into deep architectures such as S4.\nOur experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across delay reconstruction\ntasks, classification benchmarks, and long-range sequence modeling, confirming\nthat high-quality, structured initialization enabled by wavelet-based state\ndynamic offers substantial advantages over existing alternatives. WaLRUS\nprovides a scalable and versatile foundation for the next generation of deep\nSSM-based models."}
