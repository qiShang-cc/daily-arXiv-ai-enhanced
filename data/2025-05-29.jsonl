In this paper, we propose a hybrid\nlearning framework that combines offline imitation learning (IL) with online\nSoft Actor-Critic (SAC) optimization to enable a cold-start-aware microservice\nscheduling with dynamic allocation for computing resources. We first formulate\na delay-and-energy-aware scheduling problem and construct a rule-based expert\nto generate demonstration data for behavior cloning. Then, a GRU-enhanced\npolicy network is designed in the policy network to extract the correlation\namong multiple decisions by separately encoding slow-evolving node states and\nfast-changing microservice features, and an action selection mechanism is given\nto speed up the convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method\nsignificantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior final performance.\nCompared with baselines, our algorithm improves the total objective by $50\\%$\nand convergence speed by $70\\%$, and demonstrates the highest stability and\nrobustness across various edge configurations."}

One of the key innovations in 6G is\nuser-centric cell-free massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (UC-CFmMIMO), a\nparadigm that eliminates traditional cell boundaries and enhances network\nperformance by dynamically assigning access points (APs) to users. This\napproach is particularly well-suited for vehicular networks, offering seamless,\nhomogeneous, ultra-reliable, and low-latency connectivity. However, in dense\nnetworks, a key challenge lies in efficiently allocating frequency resources\nwithin a limited shared subband spectrum while accounting for frequency\nselectivity and the dependency of signal propagation on bandwidth. These\nfactors make resource allocation increasingly complex, especially in dynamic\nenvironments where maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) is critical. This paper\ntackles these challenges by proposing a hybrid multi-user allocation strategy\nthat integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and metaheuristic optimization to\nenhance spectral efficiency (SE), ensure fairness, and mitigate interference\nwithin shared subbands. To assess its effectiveness, we compare this hybrid\napproach with two other methods: the bio-inspired Aquila Optimizer (AO) and\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based Actor-Critic Reinforcement\nLearning (AC-RL). Our evaluation is grounded in real-world patterns and channel\ncharacteristics, utilizing the 3GPP-3D channel modeling framework (QuaDRiGa) to\ncapture realistic propagation conditions. The results demonstrate that the\nproposed hybrid strategy achieves a superior balance among competing\nobjectives, underscoring the role of AI-driven resource allocation in advancing\nUC-CFmMIMO systems for next-generation wireless networks."}

This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless\nsensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed\nsystem adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor\nwith multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model\ninter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The\nextracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by\nMulti-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical\nconstraints.
