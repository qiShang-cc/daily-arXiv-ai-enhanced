Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) stands as a key technology for
advancing performance metrics such as data rate, reliability, and spectrum
efficiency in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond of wireless networks.
However, its efficiency depends greatly on obtaining accurate channel state
information. This task becomes particularly challenging with increasing user
mobility. In this paper, we focus on an uplink scenario in which a massive MIMO
base station serves multiple high-mobility users. We leverage variational
Bayesian(VB) inference for joint channel estimation and data detection(JED),
tailored for time-varying channels. In particular, we use the VB framework to
provide approximations of the true posterior distributions. To cover more
real-world scenarios, we assume the time correlation coefficients associated
with the channels are unknown. Our simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed VB-based approach in tracking these unknown time correlation
coefficients. We present two processing strategies within the VB framework:
online and block processing strategies. The online strategy offers a
low-complexity solution for a given time slot, requiring only the knowledge of
the parameters/statistics within that time slot. In contrast, the block
processing strategy focuses on the entire communication block and processes all
received signals together to reduce channel estimation errors. Additionally, we
introduce an interleaved structure for the online processing strategy to
further enhance its performance. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of
our VB approach against the linear minimum mean squared error(LMMSE), the
Kalman Filter(KF), and the expectation propagation(EP) methods in terms of
symbol error rate(SER) and channel normalized mean squared error(NMSE). Our
findings reveal that our VB framework surpasses these benchmarks across the
performance metrics.

### [2] [Bridging BCI and Communications: A MIMO Framework for EEG-to-ECoG Wireless Channel Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10786)
*Jiaheng Wang,Zhenyu Wang,Tianheng Xu,Yuan Si,Ang Li,Ting Zhou,Xi Zhao,Honglin Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于频率分集MIMO的脑机接口（BCI）信道建模框架，结合神经生理学正则化方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口（BCI）与通信理论的结合是研究热点，但传统方法难以建模复杂的脑无线通信信道，相关研究尚不成熟。

Method: 利用猕猴的同步EEG和ECoG记录，提出了一种频率分集MIMO估计框架，并通过神经生理学正则化抑制噪声干扰。

Result: 实验表明，该方法较传统方法提高了估计精度，并揭示了信号持续时间对频率分辨率和时间稳定性的权衡影响。

Conclusion: 本研究为神经接口与通信理论之间建立了概念桥梁，推动了两者的协同发展。

Abstract: As a method to connect human brain and external devices, Brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) are receiving extensive research attention. Recently, the
integration of communication theory with BCI has emerged as a popular trend,
offering potential to enhance system performance and shape next-generation
communications.
  A key challenge in this field is modeling the brain wireless communication
channel between intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) emitting neurons and
extracranial electroencephalography (EEG) receiving electrodes. However, the
complex physiology of brain challenges the application of traditional channel
modeling methods, leaving relevant research in its infancy. To address this
gap, we propose a frequency-division multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
estimation framework leveraging simultaneous macaque EEG and ECoG recordings,
while employing neurophysiology-informed regularization to suppress noise
interference. This approach reveals profound similarities between neural signal
propagation and multi-antenna communication systems. Experimental results show
improved estimation accuracy over conventional methods while highlighting a
trade-off between frequency resolution and temporal stability determined by
signal duration. This work establish a conceptual bridge between neural
interfacing and communication theory, accelerating synergistic developments in
both fields.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables radio systems to
simultaneously sense and communicate with their environment. This paper,
developed within the Hexa-X-II project funded by the European Union, presents a
comprehensive cross-layer vision for ISAC in 6G networks, integrating insights
from physical-layer design, hardware architectures, AI-driven intelligence, and
protocol-level innovations. We begin by revisiting the foundational principles
of ISAC, highlighting synergies and trade-offs between sensing and
communication across different integration levels. Enabling technologies, such
as multiband operation, massive and distributed MIMO, non-terrestrial networks,
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and machine learning, are analyzed in
conjunction with hardware considerations including waveform design,
synchronization, and full-duplex operation. To bridge implementation and
system-level evaluation, we introduce a quantitative cross-layer framework
linking design parameters to key performance and value indicators. By
synthesizing perspectives from both academia and industry, this paper outlines
how deeply integrated ISAC can transform 6G into a programmable and
context-aware platform supporting applications from reliable wireless access to
autonomous mobility and digital twinning.

### [5] [Benchmarking CFAR and CNN-based Peak Detection Algorithms in ISAC under Hardware Impairments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10969)
*Paolo Tosi,Steffen Schieler,Marcus Henninger,Sebastian Semper,Silvio Mandelli*

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在6G ISAC系统中，由于通信系统设计的硬件限制，如何有效进行峰值检测。

Method: 通过建模硬件非线性效应和量化噪声，比较CFAR和CNN在噪声、多目标和分辨率限制场景下的表现。

Result: CFAR需要场景知识和窗口函数才能稳定工作，而CNN在所有场景中表现优异但需预处理。

Conclusion: CNN在复杂场景中更具优势，但需额外预处理；CFAR依赖场景知识，稳定性较差。

Abstract: Peak detection is a fundamental task in radar and has therefore been studied
extensively in radar literature. However, Integrated Sensing and Communication
(ISAC) systems for sixth generation (6G) cellular networks need to perform peak
detection under hardware impairments and constraints imposed by the underlying
system designed for communications. This paper presents a comparative study of
classical Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR)-based algorithms and a recently
proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based method for peak detection in
ISAC radar images. To impose practical constraints of ISAC systems, we model
the impact of hardware impairments, such as power amplifier nonlinearities and
quantization noise. We perform extensive simulation campaigns focusing on
multi-target detection under varying noise as well as on target separation in
resolution-limited scenarios. The results show that CFAR detectors require
approximate knowledge of the operating scenario and the use of window functions
for reliable performance. The CNN, on the other hand, achieves high performance
in all scenarios, but requires a preprocessing step for the input data.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种设计框架，用于选择极化协方差矩阵的结构，以准确反映像素的对称性。通过结合极化信息和多时相PolSAR图像的时间信息，并利用交替最大化算法（flip-flop方法）估计协方差矩阵，再通过多假设检验分类对称结构。实验证明其优于不利用时间相关性的方法，并在实测数据中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极化SAR（PolSAR）系统通过多极化观测可更准确地描述场景，但传统方法未充分利用时间信息。本文旨在通过结合极化和时间信息，提升数据解析的精度。

Method: 假设整体数据的协方差矩阵是时间和极化协方差的Kronecker积，使用flip-flop交替最大化算法估计两种协方差矩阵，并强制极化协方差满足对称性约束。对称结构分类通过多假设检验和模型选择技术实现。

Result: 仿真数据中，反射和方位对称分类的准确率分别达到94.6%和92.0%，明显优于不利用时间相关性的方法（72.5%/72.6%）。RADARSAT-2实测数据进一步验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过整合时空信息，显著提升了极化SAR数据的对称性分类精度，为地球观测任务提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: A polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) system, which uses multiple
images acquired with different polarizations in both transmission and
reception, has the potential to improve the description and interpretation of
the observed scene. This is typically achieved by exploiting the polarimetric
covariance or coherence matrix associated with each pixel, which is processed
to meet a specific goal in Earth observation. This paper presents a design
framework for selecting the structure of the polarimetric covariance matrix
that accurately reflects the symmetry associated with the analyzed pixels. The
proposed methodology leverages both polarimetric and temporal information from
multipass PolSAR images to enhance the retrieval of information from the
acquired data. To accomplish this, it is assumed that the covariance matrix (of
the overall acquired data) is given as the Kronecker product of the temporal
and polarimetric covariances. An alternating maximization algorithm, known as
the flip-flop method, is then developed to estimate both matrices while
enforcing the symmetry constraint on the polarimetric covariance. Subsequently,
the symmetry structure classification is formulated as a multiple hypothesis
testing problem, which is solved using model order selection techniques. The
proposed approach is quantitatively assessed on simulated data, showing its
advantages over its competitor, which does not exploit temporal correlations.
For example, it reaches accuracies of 94.6% and 92.0% for the reflection and
azimuth symmetry classes, respectively, while the competitor achieves 72.5% and
72.6% under the same simulation conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the
proposed framework is further demonstrated using measured RADARSAT-2 data,
corroborating the results obtained from the simulations.

Conclusion: mmWave-LoRadar方案有效整合通信与传感功能，简化硬件并提升性能，适用于未来车辆应用。

Abstract: The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique is regarded as a
key component in future vehicular applications. In this paper, we propose an
ISAC solution that integrates Long Range (LoRa) modulation with
frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar in the millimeter-wave
(mmWave) band, called mmWave-LoRadar. This design introduces the sensing
capabilities to the LoRa communication with a simplified hardware architecture.
Particularly, we uncover the dual discontinuity issues in time and phase of the
mmWave-LoRadar received signals, rendering conventional signal processing
techniques ineffective. As a remedy, we propose a corresponding hardware design
and signal processing schemes under the compressed sampling framework. These
techniques effectively cope with the dual discontinuity issues and mitigate the
demands for high-sampling-rate analog-to-digital converters while achieving
good performance. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
mmWave-LoRadar ISAC system in vehicular communication and sensing networks.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法优于传统方案，能显著减轻干扰并提升计算性能，适应动态可扩展网络。

Conclusion: 提出的展开图学习方法在多集群无线计算中表现出色，具有强适应性和高效性。

Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as a promising technology that
enables simultaneous transmission and computation through wireless channels. In
this paper, we investigate the networked AirComp in multiple clusters allowing
diversified data computation, which is yet challenged by the transceiver
coordination and interference management therein. Particularly, we aim to
maximize the multi-cluster weighted-sum AirComp rate, where the transmission
scalar as well as receive beamforming are jointly investigated while addressing
the interference issue. From an optimization perspective, we decompose the
formulated problem and adopt the alternating optimization technique with an
iterative process to approximate the solution. Then, we reinterpret the
iterations through the principle of algorithm unfolding, where the channel
condition and mutual interference in the AirComp network constitute an
underlying graph. Accordingly, the proposed unfolding architecture learns the
weights parameterized by graph neural networks, which is trained through
stochastic gradient descent approach. Simulation results show that our
proposals outperform the conventional schemes, and the proposed unfolded graph
learning substantially alleviates the interference and achieves superior
computation performance, with strong and efficient adaptation to the dynamic
and scalable networks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种混合量子-经典算法FDODMD，用于在强噪声数据下稳健估计基态能量，结合了傅里叶去噪和量子-经典信号子空间方法，通过降噪提升收敛性，且无需额外量子资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对高噪声环境下基态能量估计的挑战，传统方法难以收敛或需大量量子资源，作者提出FDODMD以降低噪声敏感性和量子计算开销。

Method: 方法结合傅里叶去噪阈值和可观测动态模式分解（ODMD），通过处理降噪后的时间域轨迹，估计系统的特征频率。

Result: 数值实验表明，FDODMD在高噪声和中等噪声环境下均优于基线方法，且在量子计算预算有限时仍能保持性能。

Conclusion: FDODMD通过经典去噪和量子-经典混合方法显著降低资源需求并提升估计效率，适用于实际分子系统的高噪声场景。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for ground state energy (GSE)
estimation that remains robust to highly noisy data and exhibits low
sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. Our approach -- Fourier Denoising
Observable Dynamic Mode Decomposition (FDODMD) -- combines Fourier-based
denoising thresholding to suppress spurious noise modes with observable dynamic
mode decomposition (ODMD), a quantum-classical signal subspace method. By
applying ODMD to an ensemble of denoised time-domain trajectories, FDODMD
reliably estimates the system's eigenfrequencies. We also provide an error
analysis of FDODMD. Numerical experiments on molecular systems demonstrate that
FDODMD achieves convergence in high-noise regimes inaccessible to baseline
methods under a limited quantum computational budget, while accelerating
spectral estimation in intermediate-noise regimes. Importantly, this
performance gain is entirely classical, requiring no additional quantum
overhead and significantly reducing overall quantum resource demands.

Motivation: 探索肠道血流调控机制，以无创方式成像小肠微循环，为消化系统生理和病理研究提供新见解。

Method: 使用CEUS和SRUS/ULM对20名健康志愿者进行成像，分析空腹、进食或应激状态下的血流速度及灌注变化。

Result: 成功获取高分辨率图像，量化了健康志愿者微血管内血流速度（2.78±0.05 mm/s）及进食后灌注显著增加（36.2%±12.2%）。

Conclusion: CEUS和SRUS/ULM是评估小肠微循环及血流变化的有效工具，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: The regulation of intestinal blood flow is critical to gastrointestinal
function. Imaging the intestinal mucosal micro-circulation in vivo has the
potential to provide new insight into the gut physiology and pathophysiology.
We aimed to determine whether ultrafast contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and
super-resolution ultrasound localisation microscopy (SRUS/ULM) could be a
useful tool for imaging the small intestine microcirculation in vivo
non-invasively and for detecting changes in blood flow in the duodenum.
Ultrafast CEUS and SRUS/ULM were used to image the small intestinal
microcirculation in a cohort of 20 healthy volunteers (BMI<25). Participants
were imaged while conscious and either having been fasted, or following
ingestion of a liquid meal or water control, or under acute stress. For the
first time we have performed ultrafast CEUS and ULM on the human small
intestine, providing unprecedented resolution images of the intestinal
microcirculation. We evaluated flow speed inside small vessels in healthy
volunteers (2.78 +/- 0.05 mm/s, mean +/- SEM) and quantified changes in the
perfusion of this microcirculation in response to nutrient ingestion. Perfusion
of the microvasculature of the intestinal mucosa significantly increased
post-prandially (36.2% +/- 12.2%, mean +/- SEM, p<0.05). The feasibility of 3D
SRUS/ULM was also demonstrated. This study demonstrates the potential utility
of ultrafast CEUS for assessing perfusion and detecting changes in blood flow
in the duodenum. SRUS/ULM also proved a useful tool to image the microvascular
blood flow in vivo non-invasively and to evaluate blood speed inside the
microvasculature of the human small intestine.

Conclusion: 展示了差分时间编码的优势，并验证了硬件中高效合并脉冲的可行性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution to the problem of
increasing computational and energy requirements for modern Machine Learning
(ML) applications. Due to their unique data representation choice of using
spikes and spike trains, they mostly rely on additions and thresholding
operations to achieve results approaching state-of-the-art (SOTA) Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs). This advantage is hindered by the fact that their
temporal characteristic does not map well to already existing accelerator
hardware like GPUs. Therefore, this work will introduce a hardware accelerator
architecture capable of computing feedforward LIF-only SNNs, as well as an
accompanying encoding method to efficiently encode already existing data into
spike trains. Together, this leads to a design capable of >99% accuracy on the
MNIST dataset, with ~0.29ms inference times on a Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGA, as
well as ~0.17ms on a custom ASIC using the open-source predictive 7nm ASAP7
PDK. Furthermore, this work will showcase the advantages of the previously
presented differential time encoding for spikes, as well as provide proof that
merging spikes from different synapses given in differential time encoding can
be done efficiently in hardware.

Conclusion: ToDMA通过token化和上下文预测，实现了高效的多设备语义通信，为未来语义通信系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Token communications (TokCom) is an emerging generative semantic
communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and
multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based token processing, with tokens
serving as universal semantic units across modalities. In this paper, we
propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as
token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a
token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding,
respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal
and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is
employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state
information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences
are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time
slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and
some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to
use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus
mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks,
achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal
communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual
quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal
communication methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放软件化系统中独立开发的应用可能存在目标冲突，需协调行为以确保系统稳定运行。

Method: 基于Stackelberg博弈框架，提出MF-UCB-PNE策略，通过多保真度贝叶斯优化学习效用函数并近似纯纳什均衡解。

Result: 理论及实证表明，MF-UCB-PNE能在有限预算下有效识别激励兼容配置。

Conclusion: MF-UCB-PNE为多应用系统协调提供了一种高效且可靠的方法。

Abstract: Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and
cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with
distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of
such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant
challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via
costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized
optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint
configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different
applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable
outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which
the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead
must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this
challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization
strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate
pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances
exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation
steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations.
We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query
cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in

Abstract: Neural networks have become ubiquitous with guitar distortion effects
modelling in recent years. Despite their ability to yield perceptually
convincing models, they are susceptible to frequency aliasing when driven by
high frequency and high gain inputs. Nonlinear activation functions create both
the desired harmonic distortion and unwanted aliasing distortion as the
bandwidth of the signal is expanded beyond the Nyquist frequency. Here, we
present a method for reducing aliasing in neural models via a teacher-student
fine tuning approach, where the teacher is a pre-trained model with its weights
frozen, and the student is a copy of this with learnable parameters. The
student is fine-tuned against an aliasing-free dataset generated by passing
sinusoids through the original model and removing non-harmonic components from
the output spectra. Our results show that this method significantly suppresses
aliasing for both long-short-term-memory networks (LSTM) and temporal
convolutional networks (TCN). In the majority of our case studies, the
reduction in aliasing was greater than that achieved by two times oversampling.
One side-effect of the proposed method is that harmonic distortion components
are also affected. This adverse effect was found to be model-dependent, with
the LSTM models giving the best balance between anti-aliasing and preserving
the perceived similarity to an analog reference device.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have introduced
groundbreaking approaches to innovating next-generation semantic communication,
which prioritizes conveying the meaning of a message rather than merely
transmitting raw data. A fundamental challenge in semantic communication lies
in accurately identifying and extracting the most critical semantic information
while adapting to downstream tasks without degrading performance, particularly
when the objective at the receiver may evolve over time. To enable flexible
adaptation to multiple tasks at the receiver, this work introduces a novel
semantic communication framework, which is capable of jointly capturing
task-specific information to enhance downstream task performance and contextual
information. Through rigorous experiments on popular image datasets and
computer vision tasks, our framework shows promising improvement compared to
existing work, including superior performance in downstream tasks, better
generalizability, ultra-high bandwidth efficiency, and low reconstruction
latency.

### [16] [Clustering Rooftop PV Systems via Probabilistic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10699)
*Kutay Bölat,Tarek Alskaif,Peter Palensky,Simon Tindemans*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于概率实体嵌入的聚类框架，用于高效管理和整合高维、有时间序列数据缺失问题的屋顶光伏系统数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着屋顶光伏（PV）安装数量的增加，如何有效监控和分析这些系统成为挑战，尤其是处理高维、空间分布且数据缺失的时间序列数据。

Method: 该方法将每个PV系统的发电特征模式和不确定性编码为概率分布，并通过统计距离和凝聚聚类对系统进行分组。

Result: 在多年度住宅PV数据集上，该方法生成的聚类配置文件在代表性和鲁棒性上优于基于物理学的基准方法，并支持可靠的数据缺失填补。

Conclusion: 此框架不仅提升了数据管理的效率，还通过系统超参数研究为平衡模型性能和鲁棒性提供了实用指导。

Abstract: As the number of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations increases,
aggregators and system operators are required to monitor and analyze these
systems, raising the challenge of integration and management of large,
spatially distributed time-series data that are both high-dimensional and
affected by missing values. In this work, a probabilistic entity
embedding-based clustering framework is proposed to address these problems.
This method encodes each PV system's characteristic power generation patterns
and uncertainty as a probability distribution, then groups systems by their
statistical distances and agglomerative clustering. Applied to a multi-year
residential PV dataset, it produces concise, uncertainty-aware cluster profiles
that outperform a physics-based baseline in representativeness and robustness,
and support reliable missing-value imputation. A systematic hyperparameter
study further offers practical guidance for balancing model performance and
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督的循环小波概率神经网络（RWPNN），用于非平稳环境中的异常检测，结合堆叠循环编码解码器和多感受域小波概率网络，提升了时间序列异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对非平稳环境中时间序列异常检测的挑战，传统方法依赖强分布假设且难以处理高维数据，RWPNN旨在通过无监督和非参数方法解决这些问题。

Method: RWPNN由两部分组成：1) 堆叠循环编码解码器（SREnc-Dec）捕获潜在空间的时序特征；2) 多感受域小波概率网络（MRWPN）构建集成概率模型。该方法扩展了小波概率网络至高维数据。

Result: 在45个真实世界时间序列数据集上验证，RWPNN在非平稳环境中表现优异，能提供异常事件的早期预警。

Conclusion: RWPNN无需强分布假设，适应不同数据变化率，显著提升了时间序列异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, an unsupervised Recurrent Wavelet Probabilistic Neural Network
(RWPNN) is proposed, which aims at detecting anomalies in non-stationary
environments by modelling the temporal features using a nonparametric density
estimation network. The novel framework consists of two components, a Stacked
Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (SREnc-Dec) module that captures temporal features in
a latent space, and a Multi-Receptive-field Wavelet Probabilistic Network
(MRWPN) that creates an ensemble probabilistic model to characterise the latent
space. This formulation extends the standard wavelet probabilistic networks to
wavelet deep probabilistic networks, which can handle higher data
dimensionality. The MRWPN module can adapt to different rates of data variation
in different datasets without imposing strong distribution assumptions,
resulting in a more robust and accurate detection for Time Series Anomaly
Detection (TSAD) tasks in the non-stationary environment. We carry out the
assessment on 45 real-world time series datasets from various domains, verify
the performance of RWPNN in TSAD tasks with several constraints, and show its
ability to provide early warnings for anomalous events.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 摘要讨论如何通过两种不确定性量化技术（蒙特卡洛丢弃和改进变分在线牛顿法）提高光电容积描记（PPG）信号在房颤分类和血压回归任务中的模型可信度，并探讨超参数选择对性能和校准的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络虽能处理大量PPG数据，但其缺乏可解释性且易过拟合，可能导致误诊或对未见数据表现不佳，因此需要量化不确定性以提高可信度。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛丢弃和改进变分在线牛顿法两种技术，评估模型在房颤分类和血压回归任务中的不确定性质量，分析超参数选择对性能和校准的影响。

Result: 超参数选择显著影响模型预测性能和不确定性质量，且不同不确定性表达方式下最佳参数配置可能不同。各预测类别的不确定性质量存在明显差异。

Conclusion: 需谨慎调参以平衡预测性能和校准质量，且应设计全面评估协议检验局部和自适应校准效果。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals encode information about relative changes
in blood volume that can be used to assess various aspects of cardiac health
non-invasively, e.g.\ to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) or predict blood
pressure (BP). Deep networks are well-equipped to handle the large quantities
of data acquired from wearable measurement devices. However, they lack
interpretability and are prone to overfitting, leaving considerable risk for
poor performance on unseen data and misdiagnosis. Here, we describe the use of
two scalable uncertainty quantification techniques: Monte Carlo Dropout and the
recently proposed Improved Variational Online Newton. These techniques are used
to assess the trustworthiness of models trained to perform AF classification
and BP regression from raw PPG time series. We find that the choice of
hyperparameters has a considerable effect on the predictive performance of the
models and on the quality and composition of predicted uncertainties. E.g. the
stochasticity of the model parameter sampling determines the proportion of the
total uncertainty that is aleatoric, and has varying effects on predictive
performance and calibration quality dependent on the chosen uncertainty
quantification technique and the chosen expression of uncertainty. We find
significant discrepancy in the quality of uncertainties over the predicted
classes, emphasising the need for a thorough evaluation protocol that assesses
local and adaptive calibration. This work suggests that the choice of
hyperparameters must be carefully tuned to balance predictive performance and
calibration quality, and that the optimal parameterisation may vary depending
on the chosen expression of uncertainty.
