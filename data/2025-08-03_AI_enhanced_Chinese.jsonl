However, how to\nintelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a\nstructure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a\ntwo-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction\nvalues of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods\nare designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced\ndeep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an\nimproved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full\neigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is\nachieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.\nFurthermore, we derive the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under\nmultiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation\nresults show that the developed three methods achieve 100\\% number of targets\nsensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior\nunder extremely-low SNR conditions.

This paper proposes an\nenvironmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the\ngenerative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location\nembedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS\nlocation information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the\ncross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to\nrespectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as\nthat among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target\nBSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM\ninference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.\nSpecifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free\nnetworks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM\nconstruction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N\nmodel is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any\npotential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by\nexploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same\nwireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to\nmulti-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same\nwireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit\ncorrelation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the\nproposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs.

This is achieved through the\ninterconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave\nreconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at\none port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local\ncontrol of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further\nenhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,\nchannel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among\nnon-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of\nNR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices\ncommunicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure\ntransmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses\nsignal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a\nphysics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural\nscattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,\nthe advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate\nan all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization\nalgorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual\ndecomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS\nconsistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal\n(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two\nimpinging and reflection directions need to be supported.

Traditional self-gating-based motion binning\nfor 5D MRI often results in residual motion artifacts due to inaccuracies in\ncardiac and respiratory signal extraction and sporadic bulk motion,\ncompromising clinical utility. EMORe addresses these issues by integrating\nadaptive inter-bin correction and explicit outlier rejection within an\nexpectation-maximization (EM) framework, whereby the E-step and M-step are\nexecuted alternately until convergence. In the E-step, probabilistic (soft) bin\nassignments are refined by correcting misassignment of valid data and rejecting\nmotion-corrupted data to a dedicated outlier bin. In the M-step, the image\nestimate is improved using the refined soft bin assignments. Validation in a\nsimulated 5D MRXCAT phantom demonstrated EMORe's superior performance compared\nto standard compressed sensing reconstruction, showing significant improvements\nin peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, edge sharpness, and\nbin assignment accuracy across varying levels of simulated bulk motion.

This work\nanalyzes the impact of different anchor point positions on gait kinematics,\nmuscular activation and energetic consumption. A total of six experiments were\nconducted with 11 subjects wearing the XoSoft exosuit, which assists hip\nflexion in five configurations. Subjects were instrumented with an IMU-based\nmotion tracking system, EMG sensors, and a mask to measure metabolic\nconsumption. The results show that positioning the knee anchor point on the\nposterior side while keeping the hip anchor on the anterior part can reduce\nmuscle activation in the hip flexors by up to 10.21\\% and metabolic expenditure\nby up to 18.45\\%. Even if the only assisted joint was the hip, all the\nconfigurations introduced changes also in the knee and ankle kinematics.\nOverall, no single configuration was optimal across all subjects, suggesting\nthat a personalized approach is necessary to transmit the assistance forces\noptimally. These findings emphasize that anchor point position does indeed have\na significant impact on exoskeleton effectiveness and efficiency.

To simultaneously support two groups of users energy\nreceivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time\nfrequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving\nERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A\nprotective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs\nto manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently,\nclosed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average\nsum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive\noptimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power\ncontrol, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term\nstatistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then\neffectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems,\nefficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the\nscattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep\nreinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power\ncontrol design.
