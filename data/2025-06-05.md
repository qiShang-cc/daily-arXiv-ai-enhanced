*Timothy B Mahoney,David B Grayden,Sam E John*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究证明，头皮下EEG在记录和分类感觉运动神经活动方面有效，支持其在慢性BCI应用中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为慢性脑机接口（BCI）应用提供一种可行的记录方法，替代传统侵入性技术。

Method: 通过绵羊模型的两个实验，评估头皮下EEG的空间分辨率和运动执行分类能力。

Result: 成功记录感觉运动节律，并能分类运动执行，性能与ECoG和血管内阵列相当。

Conclusion: 头皮下EEG信号质量接近侵入性方法，适合慢性BCI应用。

Abstract: Objective: To establish sub-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) as a viable
option for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, particularly for
chronic use, by demonstrating its effectiveness in recording and classifying
sensorimotor neural activity. Approach: Two experiments were conducted in this
study. The first aim was to demonstrate the high spatial resolution of
sub-scalp EEG through analysis of somatosensory evoked potentials in sheep
models. The second focused on the practical application of sub-scalp EEG,
classifying motor execution using data collected during a sheep behavioural
experiment. Main Results: We successfully demonstrated the recording of
sensorimotor rhythms using sub-scalp EEG in sheep models. Important spatial,
temporal, and spectral features of these signals were identified, and we were
able to classify motor execution with above-chance performance. These results
are comparable to previous work that investigated signal quality and motor
execution classification using ECoG and endovascular arrays in sheep models.
Significance: These results suggest that sub-scalp EEG may provide signal
quality that approaches that of more invasive neural recording methods such as
ECoG and endovascular arrays, and support the use of sub-scalp EEG for chronic
BCI applications.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于混合架构的波束赋形算法，旨在减少LEO卫星受到的干扰，同时优化模拟和数字预编码器。该算法在保持通信速率的同时，显著降低了干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面网络的干扰会降低低地球轨道（LEO）卫星的通信速率。为了解决这一问题，需要一种能够在频域共存并减少对卫星信号的干扰的方法。

Method: 提出了一种波束赋形算法，结合卫星干扰惩罚项，优化模拟和数字预编码器。算法在基站预编码器中纳入对卫星干扰的零化约束。

Result: 仿真显示，该算法显著降低了卫星干扰，并减少了违反LEO卫星保护阈值的概率。同时，通信总速率仅比现有混合解决方案低3%，但干扰噪声功率改善了22.4 dB。

Conclusion: 该算法在保持通信性能的同时，有效解决了LEO卫星受到地面网络干扰的问题，优于现有的混合零化算法。

Abstract: Interference from terrestrial networks can reduce the communication rate for
low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites in the upper mid-band. To coexist in
frequency, MIMO precoding can be used to reduce the signal that impinges on the
LEO satellite. We present a beamforming algorithm designed for the hybrid
architecture that incorporates a satellite interference penalty while
optimizing the analog and digital precoders. Our algorithm optimizes the
precoding at the base station (BS) within the set of precoders that null the
interference to the satellite. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithm
reduces the interference at the satellites and lowers the probability of
violating prescribed LEO satellite protection thresholds, outperforming prior
hybrid nulling algorithms. Results indicate that the algorithm maintains
sum-rate within 3\% of the existing hybrid solutions, while effectively
improving interference to noise power by 22.4 dB.

Abstract: Individuals with severe physical disabilities often experience diminished
quality of life stemming from limited ability to engage with their
surroundings. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology aims to bridge this gap
by enabling direct technology interaction. However, current BCI systems require
invasive procedures, such as craniotomy or implantation of electrodes through
blood vessels, posing significant risks to patients. Sub-scalp
electroencephalography (EEG) offers a lower risk alternative. This study
investigates the signal quality of sub-scalp EEG recordings from various depths
in a sheep model, and compares results with other methods: ECoG and
endovascular arrays. A computational model was also constructed to investigate
the factors underlying variations in electrode performance. We demonstrate that
peg electrodes placed within the sub-scalp space can achieve visual evoked
potential signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) approaching that of ECoG. Endovascular
arrays exhibited SNR comparable to electrodes positioned on the periosteum.
Furthermore, sub-scalp recordings captured high gamma neural activity, with
maximum bandwidth ranging from 120 Hz to 180 Hz depending on electrode depth.
These findings support the use of sub-scalp EEG for BCI applications, and
provide valuable insights for future sub-scalp electrode design. This data lays
the groundwork for human trials, ultimately paving the way for chronic, in-home
BCIs that empower individuals with physical disabilities.

Abstract: The emerging memristor crossbar array based computing circuits exhibit
computing speeds and energy efficiency far surpassing those of traditional
digital processors. This type of circuits can complete high-dimensional matrix
operations in an extremely short time through analog computing, making it
naturally applicable to linear detection and maximum likelihood detection in
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the challenge
of employing memristor crossbar arrays to efficiently implement other nonlinear
detection algorithms, such as the successive interference cancellation (SIC)
algorithm, remains unresolved. In this paper we propose a memristor-based
circuit design for massive MIMO SIC detector. The proposed circuit comprises
several judiciously designed analog matrix computing modules and hybrid
analog-digital slicers, which enables the proposed circuit to perform the SIC
algorithm with a hybrid analog-digital computing architecture. We show that the
computing speed and the computational energy-efficiency of the proposed
detector circuit are 43 times faster and 110 times higher, respectively, than
those of a traditional 8-core digital signal processor (DSP), and also
advantageous over the benchmark high-performance field programmable gate array
(FPGA) and graphics processing unit (GPU).

### [6] [A Generalized Graph Signal Processing Framework for Multiple Hypothesis Testing over Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03496)
*Xingchao Jian,Martin Gölz,Feng Ji,Wee Peng Tay,Abdelhak M. Zoubir*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了联合域上的多重假设检验问题，提出了一个灵活的两组模型，通过广义图信号建模异质性，从而提升检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在联合域（如图和测度空间的结合）上进行多重假设检验的问题，特别是在传感器网络等实际应用中检测信号的需求。

Method: 扩展传统的两组模型，利用广义图信号建模域上的异质性，同时利用所有可用的$p$-值进行决策。

Result: 提出的灵活统计模型能够更有效地利用联合域的信息，提升检测策略的效力。

Conclusion: 通过广义图信号建模异质性，为多重假设检验问题提供了更强大的解决方案，适用于实际应用如传感器网络检测。

Abstract: We consider the multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) problem over the joint
domain formed by a graph and a measure space. On each sample point of this
joint domain, we assign a hypothesis test and a corresponding $p$-value. The
goal is to make decisions for all hypotheses simultaneously, using all
available $p$-values. In practice, this problem resembles the detection problem
over a sensor network during a period of time. To solve this problem, we extend
the traditional two-groups model such that the prior probability of the null
hypothesis and the alternative distribution of $p$-values can be inhomogeneous
over the joint domain. We model the inhomogeneity via a generalized graph
signal. This more flexible statistical model yields a more powerful detection
strategy by leveraging the information from the joint domain.

Abstract: The rapid growth of EVs and the subsequent increase in charging demand pose
significant challenges for load grid scheduling and the operation of EV
charging stations. Effectively harnessing the spatiotemporal correlations among
EV charging stations to improve forecasting accuracy is complex. To tackle
these challenges, we propose EV-LLM for EV charging loads based on LLMs in this
paper. EV-LLM integrates the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
in spatiotemporal feature extraction with the generalization capabilities of
fine-tuned generative LLMs. Also, EV-LLM enables effective data mining and
feature extraction across multimodal and multidimensional datasets,
incorporating historical charging data, weather information, and relevant
textual descriptions to enhance forecasting accuracy for multiple charging
stations. We validate the effectiveness of EV-LLM by using charging data from
10 stations in California, demonstrating its superiority over the other
traditional deep learning methods and potential to optimize load grid
scheduling and support vehicle-to-grid interactions.

### [8] [Multiuser Beamformig for Pinching-Antenna Systems: An Element-wise Optimization Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03770)
*Mingjun Sun,Chongjun Ouyang,Shaochuan Wu,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

Result: 数值结果表明，PASS系统优于固定天线系统，ZF接近MMSE性能且优于MRT/MRC，同时方法计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效提升了系统性能，并简化了优化过程。

Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS) reconstructs wireless channels through
pinching beamforming, i.e., optimizing the activated locations of pinching
antennas (PAs) along the waveguide. The aim of this article is to investigate
the joint design of baseband beamforming and pinching beamforming. A
low-complexity element-wise sequential optimization framework is proposed to
address the sum-rate maximization problem in PASS-enabled downlink and uplink
channels. i) For the downlink scenario, maximum ratio transmission (MRT),
zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming schemes are
employed as baseband beamformers. For each beamformer, a closed-form expression
for the downlink sum-rate is derived as a single-variable function with respect
to the pinching beamformer. Based on this, a sequential optimization method is
proposed, where the positions of the PAs are updated element-wise using a
low-complexity one-dimensional search. ii) For the uplink scenario, signal
detection is performed using maximum ratio combining (MRC), ZF, and MMSE
combiners. A closed-form sum-rate expression is derived for each linear
combiner, and a similar element-wise design is applied to optimize the pinching
beamforming. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of
the proposed method and demonstrate that: (i) For all considered linear
beamformers, the proposed PASS architecture outperforms conventional
fixed-antenna systems in terms of sum-rate performance; (ii) in both downlink
and uplink channels, ZF achieves performance close to that of MMSE and
significantly outperforms MRT or MRC; and (iii) the proposed element-wise
design eliminates the need for alternating updates between the baseband and
pinching beamformers, thereby ensuring low computational complexity.

### [9] [Nonlinear Sparse Bayesian Learning Methods with Application to Massive MIMO Channel Estimation with Hardware Impairments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03775)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于高斯过程和非线性稀疏贝叶斯学习的信道估计框架，用于解决大规模MIMO系统中硬件非线性失真问题，提升了估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信道估计方法假设理想接收机硬件和线性信号模型，但实际硬件存在非线性失真（如低噪声放大器的非线性和量化误差），导致估计精度下降。

Method: 提出高斯过程回归建模硬件失真函数，结合稀疏贝叶斯学习方法，设计了两种非线性SBL算法。

Result: 实验表明，在强失真和高信噪比条件下，新方法显著优于传统线性估计器。

Conclusion: 非线性失真感知的信道估计框架有效提升了大规模MIMO系统的性能。

Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is critical for realizing the performance gains
of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Traditional
approaches to channel estimation typically assume ideal receiver hardware and
linear signal models. However, practical receivers suffer from impairments such
as nonlinearities in the low-noise amplifiers and quantization errors, which
invalidate standard model assumptions and degrade the estimation accuracy. In
this work, we propose a nonlinear channel estimation framework that models the
distortion function arising from hardware impairments using Gaussian process
(GP) regression while leveraging the inherent sparsity of massive MIMO
channels. First, we form a GP-based surrogate of the distortion function,
employing pseudo-inputs to reduce the computational complexity. Then, we
integrate the GP-based surrogate of the distortion function into newly
developed enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) methods, enabling
distortion-aware sparse channel estimation. Specifically, we propose two
nonlinear SBL methods based on distinct optimization objectives, each offering
a different trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational complexity.
Numerical results demonstrate significant gains over the Bussgang linear
minimum mean squared error estimator and linear SBL, particularly under strong
distortion and at high signal-to-noise ratio.

### [10] [An OTFS-based Random Access Scheme for GNSS Independent Operation in NTN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03852)
*Marius Caus,Musbah Shaat*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了无GNSS支持的非地面网络随机接入过程，提出了一种基于OTFS调制的ZC序列设计，以提高信号强度和减少开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无GNSS支持的非地面网络中，定位不确定性可能达数千米，影响用户设备的开环补偿机制，因此需要增强随机接入信号设计的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过将相同的ZC序列串联并调制到OTFS中，利用OTFS特性相干组合接收信号，同时最小化循环前缀的开销。

Result: 在LEO卫星场景下，尽管存在显著定位误差，OTFS设计在PAPR和MDP上与OFDM方案相当，同时改善了频谱限制并降低了开销。

Conclusion: OTFS随机接入设计为GNSS独立的非地面网络接入提供了鲁棒且频谱高效的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the random access procedure for non-terrestrial
networks operating without global navigation satellite system (GNSS) support.
In such scenarios, positioning uncertainties can reach several kilometers,
which directly impacts the open-loop compensation mechanisms employed by the
user equipment. To ensure that the resulting time and carrier frequency offsets
can be handled by the network, the robustness of the standardized random access
signal design and detection scheme must be enhanced. To extend radio access
capabilities, identical Zadoff Chu (ZC) sequences are concatenated and then
modulated into the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. Thanks to
the specific characteristics of the OTFS-based random access signal, the
received sequences are coherently combined, thereby maximizing the desired
signal strength. Additionally, the proposed preamble minimizes the overhead
associated with the cyclic prefix (CP) transmission. Numerical evaluations in a
regenerative low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite scenario show that, despite
significant positioning errors, the proposed OTFS random access design attains
comparable peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and missed detection probability
(MDP) to OFDM-based solutions, while improving spectral confinement and
reducing overhead. These results demonstrate that the proposed OTFS-based
random access design offers a robust and spectrally efficient alternative to
OFDM for GNSS-independent NTN access.

Abstract: Graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) is an extension of graph Fourier
transform (GFT) that provides an additional fractional analysis tool for graph
signal processing (GSP) by generalizing temporal-vertex domain Fourier analysis
to fractional orders. In recent years, a large number of studies on GFRFT based
on undirected graphs have emerged, but there are very few studies on directed
graphs. Therefore, in this paper, one of our main contributions is to introduce
two novel GFRFTs defined on Cartesian product graph of two directed graphs, by
performing singular value decomposition on graph fractional Laplacian matrices.
We prove that two proposed GFRFTs can effectively express spatial-temporal data
sets on directed graphs with strong correlation. Moreover, we extend the
theoretical results to a generalized Cartesian product graph, which is
constructed by $m$ directed graphs. Finally, the denoising performance of our
proposed two GFRFTs are testified through simulation by processing hourly
temperature data sets collected from 32 weather stations in the Brest region of
France.

Conclusion: OLCT框架下的相位恢复在多种条件下具有唯一性，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The classical phase retrieval refers to the recovery of an unknown signal
from its Fourier magnitudes, which is widely used in fields such as quantum
mechanics, signal processing, optics, etc. The offset linear canonical
transform (OLCT), which is a more general type of linear integral transform
including Fourier transform (FT), fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), and
linear canonical transform (LCT) as its special cases. Hence, in this paper, we
focus on the uniqueness problem of phase retrieval in the framework of OLCT.
First, we prove that all the nontrivial ambiguities in continuous OLCT phase
retrieval can be represented by convolution operators, and demonstrate that a
continuous compactly supported signal can be uniquely determined up to a global
phase from its multiple magnitude-only OLCT measurements. Moreover, we
investigate the nontrivial ambiguities in the discrete OLCT phase retrieval
case. Furthermore, we demenstrate that a nonseparable function can be uniquely
recovered from its magnitudes of short-time OLCT (STOLCT) up to a global phase.
Finally, we show that signals which are bandlimited in FT or OLCT domain can be
reconstructed from its sampled STOLCT magnitude measurements, up to a global
phase, providing the ambiguity function of window function satisfies some mild
conditions.

*Ye Tian,Xueting Xu,Ao Peng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于不确定性视角的任务导向解耦表示学习方法，利用多时间CIR观测直接映射到位置，提高5G中多径辅助定位的精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将反射面视为理想反射器，难以处理由漫反射引起的不可区分多径问题。本文从不确定性视角研究漫反射特性，旨在提升定位精度。

Conclusion: 证明了CIR中漫反射与镜面反射特征的可分离性，提出方法有效提升了5G多径辅助定位性能。

Abstract: In the fifth-generation communication system (5G), multipath-assisted
positioning (MAP) has emerged as a promising approach. With the enhancement of
signal resolution, multipath component (MPC) are no longer regarded as noise
but rather as valuable information that can contribute to positioning. However,
existing research often treats reflective surfaces as ideal reflectors, while
being powerless in the face of indistinguishable multipath caused by diffuse
reflectors. This study approaches diffuse reflectors from the perspective of
uncertainty, investigating the statistical distribution characteristics of
indoor diffuse and specular reflectors. Based on these insights, a task-guided
disentangled representation learning method leveraging multi-time channel
impulse response (CIR) observations is designed to directly map CIRs to
positions, while mitigating the adverse effects of components that contribute
minimally to localization accuracy (e.g., diffuse multipath).In this
semi-supervised learning framework, a global feature extraction architecture
based on self-attention is proposed to capture location-independent wireless
environmental information, while an MLP is employed to extract the time-varying
features related to user equipment (UE) positions. Variational inference based
on a latent variable model (LVM) is applied to separate independent features
within the CIR, with position labels guiding the LVM to express components more
beneficial for localization. Additionally, we provide a feasibility proof for
the separability of diffuse and specular environmental features in CIRs.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher
localization accuracy compared to conventional search-based localization
methods, with enhanced robustness against indistinguishable multipath from
diffuse reflectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法在用户设备（UE）和基站（BTS）之间频繁交换参数，导致高通信开销。

Method: 通过在BTS端设置共享模型，UE端设置多个本地模型，并采用管道模块减少训练时间。通过限制边界参数的交换，显著降低了通信开销。

Result: 该方法显著减少了联邦CSI反馈训练中交换的参数，优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 提出的模型分割方法有效降低了通信开销，提升了联邦学习的效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements have introduced federated machine learning-based channel
state information (CSI) compression before the user equipments (UEs) upload the
downlink CSI to the base transceiver station (BTS). However, most existing
algorithms impose a high communication overhead due to frequent parameter
exchanges between UEs and BTS. In this work, we propose a model splitting
approach with a shared model at the BTS and multiple local models at the UEs to
reduce communication overhead. Moreover, we implant a pipeline module at the
BTS to reduce training time. By limiting exchanges of boundary parameters
during forward and backward passes, our algorithm can significantly reduce the
exchanged parameters over the benchmarks during federated CSI feedback
training.

Abstract: Distinguishing between reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted
paths and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths is a fundamental problem for
RIS-assisted integrated sensing and communication. In this work, we propose a
pattern alternation scheme for the RIS response that uses part of the RIS as a
dynamic part to modulate the estimated channel power, which can considerably
help the user equipments (UEs) to identify the RIS-assisted paths. Under such a
dynamic setup, we formulate the detection framework for a single UE, where we
develop a statistical model of the estimated channel power, allowing us to
analytically evaluate the performance of the system. We investigate our method
under two critical factors: the number of RIS elements allocated for the
dynamic part and the allocation of RIS elements among different users.
Simulation results verify the accuracy of our analysis.

*Masaya Kawamura,Takuya Hasumi,Yuma Shirahata,Ryuichi Yamamoto*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种高压缩、轻量级的语音合成（TTS）模型，通过量化感知训练（QAT）和权重索引两种技术，将模型参数压缩至1.58位，实现83%的模型尺寸减少，同时保持优于基准模型的合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对设备端应用的语音合成需求，研究如何在减小模型尺寸的同时保持合成质量，以满足低存储和计算资源的要求。

Method: 采用量化感知训练（QAT）将模型参数量化为1.58位（三元值{-1, 0, 1}），并提出权重索引方法，将一组1.58位权重存储为单个int8索引，以高效存储模型参数。

Result: 模型尺寸减少83%，同时在合成质量上优于未量化的基准模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了设备端TTS模型的存储和计算资源限制问题，是一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a highly compact, lightweight text-to-speech (TTS) model
for on-device applications. To reduce the model size, the proposed model
introduces two techniques. First, we introduce quantization-aware training
(QAT), which quantizes model parameters during training to as low as 1.58-bit.
In this case, most of 32-bit model parameters are quantized to ternary values
{-1, 0, 1}. Second, we propose a method named weight indexing. In this method,
we save a group of 1.58-bit weights as a single int8 index. This allows for
efficient storage of model parameters, even on hardware that treats values in
units of 8-bit. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieved 83 % reduction in model size, while outperforming the baseline of
similar model size without quantization in synthesis quality.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了自监督学习（SSL）模型在印度东北部三种低资源语言（Angami、Ao、Mizo）中的声调识别效果，发现Mizo表现最佳，Angami最差，且中间层对声调识别最关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在分析SSL模型在低资源语言中的声调识别能力，为改进此类语言的声调识别提供依据。

Method: 评估了四种Wav2vec2.0基础模型，分析其在三种语言中的声调识别表现，并比较不同预训练语言（有声调与无声调）的影响。

Result: Mizo的声调识别效果最佳，Angami最差；SSL模型的中间层对声调识别最为关键；声调库存、类型及方言变化影响识别效果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了SSL模型在低资源语言声调识别中的优势与不足，为未来优化提供了方向。

Abstract: This study explores the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) models for tone
recognition in three low-resource languages from North Eastern India: Angami,
Ao, and Mizo. We evaluate four Wav2vec2.0 base models that were pre-trained on
both tonal and non-tonal languages. We analyze tone-wise performance across the
layers for all three languages and compare the different models. Our results
show that tone recognition works best for Mizo and worst for Angami. The middle
layers of the SSL models are the most important for tone recognition,
regardless of the pre-training language, i.e. tonal or non-tonal. We have also
found that the tone inventory, tone types, and dialectal variations affect tone
recognition. These findings provide useful insights into the strengths and
weaknesses of SSL-based embeddings for tonal languages and highlight the
potential for improving tone recognition in low-resource settings. The source

*Oluwaseyi Giwa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对动态无线网络中的因果推理问题，提出了一种基于顺序回归的算法，并结合NOTEARS无环性约束，实现了高效的在线更新。通过理论推导和仿真验证，量化了检测延迟与网络规模、噪声方差和衰落严重性的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态因果模型难以应对无线网络中的动态干扰和衰落，因此需要开发能够在线更新的因果推理方法，以确保网络可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种顺序回归算法，并引入NOTEARS无环性约束，以实现高效的因果结构更新。通过理论分析和蒙特卡洛仿真验证了方法的有效性。

Result: 理论推导出检测延迟的上下界，仿真表明延迟与网络规模呈线性增长，与噪声方差呈二次增长，与结构变化幅度呈反比平方关系。

Conclusion: 本文为设计非稳态无线环境下鲁棒的在线因果推理机制提供了理论依据和实践指导，有助于提升网络可靠性。

Abstract: Dynamic causal discovery in wireless networks is essential due to evolving
interference, fading, and mobility, which complicate traditional static causal
models. This paper addresses causal inference challenges in dynamic fading
wireless environments by proposing a sequential regression-based algorithm with
a novel application of the NOTEARS acyclicity constraint, enabling efficient
online updates. We derive theoretical lower and upper bounds on the detection
delay required to identify structural changes, explicitly quantifying their
dependence on network size, noise variance, and fading severity. Monte Carlo
simulations validate these theoretical results, demonstrating linear increases
in detection delay with network size, quadratic growth with noise variance, and
inverse-square dependence on the magnitude of structural changes. Our findings
provide rigorous theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing
robust online causal inference mechanisms to maintain network reliability under
nonstationary wireless conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增强的WMMSE算法（eWMMSE）和基于图神经网络的JCPGNN-M方法，用于多信道无线网络中的联合信道和功率分配（JCPA），以实现高效的干扰管理和低计算复杂度。JCPGNN-M支持多信道分配，且在大规模网络中表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动设备数量的增加，干扰成为提升无线网络数据速率的主要瓶颈，因此需要高效的联合信道和功率分配方法来管理干扰。

Method: 论文首先提出eWMMSE算法解决JCPA问题，随后引入基于图神经网络的JCPGNN-M方法，通过拉格朗日函数重新建模问题，并结合GNN实现低复杂度的多信道分配。

Result: 仿真结果显示，JCPGNN-M在数据速率上优于eWMMSE，且推理时间更短，能够扩展到大规模网络。

Conclusion: JCPGNN-M是一种高效且可扩展的方法，适用于密集网络中的联合信道和功率分配问题。

Abstract: As the number of mobile devices continues to grow, interference has become a
major bottleneck in improving data rates in wireless networks. Efficient joint
channel and power allocation (JCPA) is crucial for managing interference. In
this paper, we first propose an enhanced WMMSE (eWMMSE) algorithm to solve the
JCPA problem in multi-channel wireless networks. To reduce the computational
complexity of iterative optimization, we further introduce JCPGNN-M, a graph
neural network-based solution that enables simultaneous multi-channel
allocation for each user. We reformulate the problem as a Lagrangian function,
which allows us to enforce the total power constraints systematically. Our
solution involves combining this Lagrangian framework with GNNs and iteratively
updating the Lagrange multipliers and resource allocation scheme. Unlike
existing GNN-based methods that limit each user to a single channel, JCPGNN-M
supports efficient spectrum reuse and scales well in dense network scenarios.
Simulation results show that JCPGNN-M achieves better data rate compared to
eWMMSE. Meanwhile, the inference time of JCPGNN-M is much lower than eWMMS, and
it can generalize well to larger networks.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 5G/6G旁链通信解决外部UE无法直接连接基站的问题，通过内部UE中继。优化问题旨在最大化加权和速率，提出了贪心算法和公平性算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决外部UE通过内部UE中继连接基站的性能问题，关注速率、连接数和延迟。

Method: 制定了最大化加权和速率的优化问题，提出贪心算法和公平性调整算法。

Result: 贪心算法高效但可能忽略公平性；公平性算法提高了UE的平均接纳率和公平性。

Conclusion: 公平性算法在旁链通信中实现了平衡和公平的解决方案。

Abstract: 5G/6G sidelink communications addresses the challenge of connecting outer
UEs, which are unable to directly access a base station (gNodeB), through inner
UEs that act as relays to connect to the gNodeB. The key performance indicators
include the achievable rates, the number of outer UEs that can connect to a
gNodeB, and the latency experienced by outer UEs in establishing connections.
We consider problem of determining the assignment of outer UEs to inner UEs
based on the channel, interference, and traffic characteristics. We formulate
an optimization problem to maximize a weighted sum rate of UEs, where weights
can represent priority, waiting time, and queue length. This optimization
accommodates constraints related to channel and interference characteristics
that influence the rates at which links can successfully carry assigned
traffic. While an exhaustive search can establish an upper bound on achievable
rates by this non-convex optimization problem, it becomes impractical for
larger number of outer UEs due to scalability issues related to high
computational complexity. To address this, we present a greedy algorithm that
incrementally selects links to maximize the sum rate, considering already
activated links. This algorithm, although effective in achieving high sum
rates, may inadvertently overlook some UEs, raising concerns about fairness. To
mitigate this, we introduce a fairness-oriented algorithm that adjusts weights
based on waiting time or queue length, ensuring that UEs with initially
favorable conditions do not unduly disadvantage others over time. We show that
this strategy not only improves the average admission ratio of UEs but also
ensures a more equitable distribution of service among them, thereby providing
a balanced and fair solution to sidelink communications.

Abstract: Logistic regression is a fundamental and widely used statistical method for
modeling binary outcomes based on covariates. However, the presence of missing
data, particularly in settings involving hybrid covariates (a mix of discrete
and continuous variables), poses significant challenges. In this paper, we
propose a novel Expectation-Maximization based algorithm tailored for parameter
estimation in logistic regression models with missing hybrid covariates. The
proposed method is specifically designed to handle these complexities,
delivering efficient parameter estimates. Through comprehensive simulations and
real-world application, we demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and reliability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在满足差分隐私（DP）条件下发布高斯混合模型（GMM）参数的方法，通过优化KL散度来平衡隐私保护与模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于GMM参数的发布可能导致隐私泄露，研究目的是在确保DP的前提下安全发布这些参数。

Result: 理论分析和实验证明，方法在合成和真实数据集上实现了高隐私保护与高效用。

Conclusion: 该方法为GMM参数的隐私保护发布提供了有效解决方案，同时保持模型的高实用性。

Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are widely used statistical models for
representing multi-modal data distributions, with numerous applications in data
mining, pattern recognition, data simulation, and machine learning. However,
recent research has shown that releasing GMM parameters poses significant
privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive information about the underlying
data. In this paper, we address the challenge of releasing GMM parameters while
ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Specifically, we focus on the
privacy protection of mixture weights, component means, and covariance
matrices. We propose to use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a utility
metric to assess the accuracy of the released GMM, as it captures the joint
impact of noise perturbation on all the model parameters. To achieve privacy,
we introduce a DP mechanism that adds carefully calibrated random perturbations
to the GMM parameters. Through theoretical analysis, we quantify the effects of
privacy budget allocation and perturbation statistics on the DP guarantee, and
derive a tractable expression for evaluating KL divergence. We formulate and
solve an optimization problem to minimize the KL divergence between the
released and original models, subject to a given $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP
constraint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves strong privacy guarantees while
maintaining high utility.

Result: 仿真结果表明所提方案在能量效率、感知性能和通信安全方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为RSMA辅助的ISAC系统提供了一种安全的传输优化方案，适用于不同窃听场景。

Abstract: This work investigates the physical layer security of rate-splitting multiple
access (RSMA)-aided integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) systems. The
ISAC base station (BS) transmits signals to communicate with users in an
eavesdropped scenario and to estimate the parameters of the sensed targets. The
research considers different sensing signals under RSMA technology and the
Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound of the parameter estimation is utilized as the sensing
metric. With the channel state information (CSI) of eavesdroppers known, the
transmitting beam of the BS is optimized to maximize the energy efficiency in
terms of the minimum user rate and secrecy capacity, considering the fairness
among users and ensuring the sensing performance and communication security.
With the CSI of eavesdroppers unknown, the transmitting beam of the BS is
designed to minimize the energy consumption for sensing and communication, and
the residual power is utilized for artificial noise, which is isotropically
emitted to achieve interference with potential eavesdroppers. To solve the
non-convex problems, three iterative algorithms based on successive convex
approximation and penalty function are proposed. The simulation results
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

Conclusion: 提出的量化码本在减少反馈比特数的同时保持了性能，为RIS系统的反馈设计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can greatly improve the signal
quality of future communication systems by reflecting transmitted signals
toward the receiver. However, even when the base station (BS) has perfect
channel knowledge and can compute the optimal RIS phase-shift configuration,
implementing this configuration requires feedback signaling over a control
channel from the BS to the RIS. This feedback must be kept minimal, as it is
transmitted wirelessly every time the channel changes. In this paper, we
examine how the feedback load, measured in bits, affects the performance of an
RIS-aided system. Specifically, we investigate the trade-offs between
codebook-based and element-wise feedback schemes, and how these influence the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We propose a novel quantization codebook tailored
for line-of-sight (LoS) that guarantees a minimal SNR loss using a number of
feedback bits that scale logarithmically with the number of RIS elements. We
demonstrate the codebook's usefulness over Rician fading channels and how to
extend it to handle a non-zero static path. Numerical simulations and
analytical analysis are performed to quantify the performance degradation that
results from a reduced feedback load, shedding light on how efficiently RIS
configurations can be fed back in practical systems.

*Lin Zhou,Qianyun Wang,Yun Wei,Jingjing Wang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了统计序列匹配问题，推导了具有有限预期停止时间的顺序测试的理论性能保证，揭示了顺序测试相比固定长度测试的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究统计序列匹配问题的性能极限，尤其是在顺序测试框架下，解决未知分布生成序列的匹配问题。

Method: 针对已知和未知匹配数量的情况，分别提出了最优顺序测试，并分析了其错误概率的指数衰减率。

Result: 顺序测试的误匹配指数优于固定长度测试，并在未知匹配数量情况下提出了具有有限预期停止时间的测试方法。

Conclusion: 顺序测试在统计序列匹配中具有显著优势，特别是在复杂情况下（如未知匹配数量）表现更优。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of statistical sequence matching initiated by
Unnikrishnan (TIT 2015) and derive theoretical performance guarantees for
sequential tests that have bounded expected stopping times. Specifically, in
this problem, one is given two databases of sequences and the task is to
identify all matched pairs of sequences. In each database, each sequence is
generated i.i.d. from a distinct distribution and a pair of sequences is said
matched if they are generated from the same distribution. The generating
distribution of each sequence is \emph{unknown}. We first consider the case
where the number of matches is known and derive the exact exponential decay
rate of the mismatch (error) probability, a.k.a. the mismatch exponent, under
each hypothesis for optimal sequential tests. Our results reveal the benefit of
sequentiality by showing that optimal sequential tests have larger mismatch
exponent than fixed-length tests by Zhou \emph{et al.} (TIT 2024).
Subsequently, we generalize our achievability result to the case of unknown
number of matches. In this case, two additional error probabilities arise:
false alarm and false reject probabilities. We propose a corresponding
sequential test, show that the test has bounded expected stopping time under
certain conditions, and characterize the tradeoff among the exponential decay
rates of three error probabilities. Furthermore, we reveal the benefit of
sequentiality over the two-step fixed-length test by Zhou \emph{et al.} (TIT
2024) and propose an one-step fixed-length test that has no worse performance
than the fixed-length test by Zhou \emph{et al.} (TIT 2024). When specialized
to the case where either database contains a single sequence, our results
specialize to large deviations of sequential tests for statistical
classification, the binary case of which was recently studied by Hsu, Li and
Wang (ITW 2022).
