*Jiawang Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 一种低成本、宽带的倾斜波束天线设计，结合槽天线和单极子阵列，实现高增益和宽带宽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足毫米波应用中车辆覆盖的需求，设计一种低成本且性能优越的天线。

Method: 提出了一种创新的槽天线与单极子阵列组合设计，通过直接激励和电磁耦合实现高效性能。

Result: 天线实现了76.5%的阻抗带宽（20-44.78 GHz）和6.1 dBi的峰值增益。

Conclusion: 该设计在低成本下实现了高性能的宽带倾斜波束天线，适合毫米波应用。

Abstract: To facilitate vehicle coverage for millimeter-wave applications, this
communication presents a low-cost, wideband tilted-beam antenna. A novel design
is proposed in which a slot antenna is both directly excited and
electromagnetically coupled to a monopole array. This slot-monopole
configuration is inherently robust against substrate losses, enabling low-cost
fabrication while maintaining high realized gain and compact size. Furthermore,
the slot-fed structure effectively excites multiple resonant modes within the
monopole array, resulting in a significantly enhanced bandwidth. Experimental
results demonstrate that the antenna achieves a -10-dB impedance bandwidth of
over 76.5% (20-44.78 GHz) and a peak realized gain of 6.1 dBi.

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合建模拓扑和信号，显著提升了嵌入的解释性和网络重建性能。

Abstract: Dynamics on and of networks refer to changes in topology and node-associated
signals, respectively and are pervasive in many socio-technological systems,
including social, biological, and infrastructure networks. Due to practical
constraints, privacy concerns, or malfunctions, we often observe only a
fraction of the topological evolution and associated signal, which not only
hinders downstream tasks but also restricts our analysis of network evolution.
Such aspects could be mitigated by moving our attention at the underlying
latent driving factors of the network evolution, which can be naturally
uncovered via low-rank tensor decomposition. Tensor-based methods provide a
powerful means of uncovering the underlying factors of network evolution
through low-rank decompositions. However, the extracted embeddings typically
lack a relational structure and are obtained independently from the node
signals. This disconnect reduces the interpretability of the embeddings and
overlooks the coupling between topology and signals. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel two-way decomposition to represent a dynamic
graph topology, where the structural evolution is captured by a linear
combination of latent graph adjacency matrices reflecting the overall joint
evolution of both the topology and the signal. Using spatio-temporal data, we
estimate the latent adjacency matrices and their temporal scaling signatures
via alternating minimization, and prove that our approach converges to a
stationary point. Numerical results show that the proposed method recovers
individually and collectively expressive latent graphs, outperforming both
standard tensor-based decompositions and signal-based topology identification
methods in reconstructing the missing network especially when observations are
limited.

### [3] [Extended Spherical Geometry Algorithm for Spaceborne SAR Processing in Stripmap and TOPS Imaging Modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08620)
*Xinhua Mao,Manyi Tao,Jixia Fan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SGA算法在精确高效的空间SAR成像中表现优异，但仅适用于聚束模式。本文改进了SGA，使其能处理条带和TOPS模式，通过瞬时多普勒中心去除和匹配滤波提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原SGA仅适用于聚束模式SAR数据处理，无法直接应用于其他模式（如条带或TOPS模式），因此需改进算法以扩展其适用性。

Method: 分析SGA在条带和TOPS模式中的局限性，提出改进算法：1）在方位重采样前添加瞬时多普勒中心去除步骤；2）用匹配滤波替代原算法的频谱分析方法。

Result: 改进算法避免了方位重采样中的欠采样问题，减少了方位方向的图像混叠，并提升了计算效率。实测数据验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 改进后的SGA算法能有效处理条带和TOPS模式SAR数据，解决了原算法的局限性，并提升了成像质量和效率。

Abstract: The Spherical Geometry Algorithm (SGA) demonstrates superior capability in
achieving efficient and precise spaceborne SAR image formation processing, even
under challenging imaging conditions including non-linear radar trajectories
and spherical Earth surface geometry. Nevertheless, the original SGA is
specifically developed for spotlight SAR data processing and can't directly
applied to processing spaceborne SAR data in other modes. In this paper, we
first analyze the limitations of the SGA algorithm when applied to stripmap or
TOPS mode SAR processing, and then propose an improved SGA algorithm which can
process both stripmap and TOPS SAR data. Compared with the original algorithm,
the new algorithm has two main differences. Firstly, in order to avoid
undersampling during azimuth resampling in both modes, an instantaneous Doppler
centroid removal process was added before azimuth interpolation processing by
exploiting the endomorphism property of resampling operation. Secondly, the
spectral analysis method used for the final step of azimuth compression in the
original SGA has been replaced with a new matched filtering processing, which
can avoid image aliasing in azimuth direction and improve computational
efficiency. Measured real data processing results are presented to demonstrate
the validity of the proposed algorithms.

### [4] [Timing advance and Doppler shift estimation in LEO satellite networks: A recursive Bayesian study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08739)
*Ashutosh Balakrishnan,Pierre Popineau,Philippe Martins*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩展卡尔曼滤波的递归贝叶斯框架，用于准确估计低轨道卫星网络中移动用户设备的定时提前和多普勒频移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决低轨道卫星网络中的高速移动和路径损耗问题，提高初始接入过程的精确性。

Method: 通过扩展卡尔曼滤波（EKF）递归贝叶斯框架建模卫星-用户设备的联合动态，考虑卫星加速度和非线性运动特性。

Result: 框架能有效估计定时提前和多普勒频移，适应高用户设备速度的场景。

Conclusion: 该研究为低轨道卫星非地面网络的实现提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite based non-terrestrial networks are a key
theme of the upcoming 6G networks. These space networks are proposed to be used
for high-mobility use-cases like airplanes and vehicles. The initial access
process between a base station (BS) and a user equipment (UE) involves timing
advance (TA) value computation at the BS, requiring precise BS location
information at the UE. It becomes more challenging in LEO satellite networks
due to the fast moving LEO satellites and large pathloss, in addition to the
mobile UE. This paper aims to compute the TA and Doppler shift experienced at
the UE by modeling the joint system dynamics in a LEO satellite-mobile UE
network through an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based recursive Bayesian
framework. The framework accurately models the joint system dynamics by
considering the LEO satellite acceleration. It constructs the Jacobian to
linearize the inherent non-linearities present in the motion. Probabilistic
insights regarding the state-update and propagation are also provided. The
analytical framework factors in the limited satellite visibility at the UE and
the satellite-UE geometry w.r.t. the earth center. The proposed framework is
also useful when the satellite and UE clocks are not in sync, with the
corresponding clock drift a function of the measured time difference of
arrivals. Our results showcase the efficacy and robustness of the proposed EKF
framework to estimate the TA and Doppler shift, even at very high UE speeds.
The work is expected to be extremely useful in realizing LEO satellite based
non-terrestrial networks.

### [5] [Confidence Boosts Trust-Based Resilience in Cooperative Multi-Robot Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08807)
*Luca Ballotta,Áron Vékássy,Stephanie Gil,Michal Yemini*

Main category: eess.SP

Conclusion: 通过合理设置λt，可在协调效率与任务速度间取得平衡，为多机器人系统安全提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Wireless communication-based multi-robot systems open the door to
cyberattacks that can disrupt safety and performance of collaborative robots.
The physical channel supporting inter-robot communication offers an attractive
opportunity to decouple the detection of malicious robots from task-relevant
data exchange between legitimate robots. Yet, trustworthiness indications
coming from physical channels are uncertain and must be handled with this in
mind. In this paper, we propose a resilient protocol for multi-robot operation
wherein a parameter {\lambda}t accounts for how confident a robot is about the
legitimacy of nearby robots that the physical channel indicates. Analytical
results prove that our protocol achieves resilient coordination with
arbitrarily many malicious robots under mild assumptions. Tuning {\lambda}t
allows a designer to trade between near-optimal inter-robot coordination and
quick task execution; see Fig. 1. This is a fundamental performance tradeoff
and must be carefully evaluated based on the task at hand. The effectiveness of
our approach is numerically verified with experiments involving platoons of
autonomous cars where some vehicles are maliciously spoofed.

### [6] [Hardware Limitations and Optimization Approach in 1-Bit RIS Design at 28 GHz](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08930)
*Hossein Rezaei,Mehmet Emin Arslan,George Yammine,Niels Neumann,Norman Franchi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 1-bit RIS原型在28 GHz下的实验研究表明，硬件限制导致的相位量化误差可通过遗传算法优化减少增益损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决RIS实际应用中因硬件限制和相位量化误差导致的性能问题。

Method: 开发1-bit RIS原型，结合物理参数分析反射模式，并引入遗传算法优化相位量化误差。

Result: 通过测量验证，遗传算法优化有效减少了因1-bit量化导致的增益损失。

Conclusion: 先进相位控制技术对提升RIS功能至关重要。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative
technology for electromagnetic (EM) wave manipulation, offering unprecedented
control over wave reflections compared to traditional metallic reflectors. By
utilizing an array of tunable elements, RIS can steer and shape electromagnetic
waves to enhance signal quality in wireless communication and radar systems.
However, practical implementations face significant challenges due to hardware
limitations and phase quantization errors. In this work, a 1-bit RIS prototype
operating at 28 GHz is developed to experimentally evaluate the impact of
hardware constraints on RIS performance. Unlike conventional studies that model
RIS as an ideal phase-shift matrix, this study accounts for physical parameters
that influence the actual reflection pattern. In particular, the presence of
specular reflection due to hardware limitations is investigated. Additionally,
the effects of phase quantization errors, which stem from the discrete nature
of RIS elements, are analyzed, and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization
is introduced to mitigate these errors. The proposed optimization strategy
effectively reduces gain degradation at the desired angle caused by 1-bit
quantization, enhancing the overall performance of RIS. The effectiveness of
the approach is validated through measurements, underscoring the importance of
advanced phase control techniques in improving the functionality of RIS.

### [7] [Semantic Communication for Cooperative Multi-Tasking over Rate-Limited Wireless Channels with Implicit Optimal Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08944)
*Ahmad Halimi Razlighi,Carsten Bockelmann,Armin Dekorsy*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文扩展了多任务语义通信框架，提出了适用于实际速率受限无线信道的设计方案，通过混合学习方法实现稳健通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决速率受限无线信道中的多任务语义通信问题，提出更通用的系统模型。

Method: 采用KL散度表示速率限制，结合密度比技巧和隐式最优先验方法，提出混合学习方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该系统在速率受限场景下具有有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代无线网络的智能通信提供了潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we expand the cooperative multi-task semantic communication
framework (CMT-SemCom) introduced in [1], which divides the semantic encoder on
the transmitter side into a common unit (CU) and multiple specific units (SUs),
to a more applicable design. Our proposed system model addresses real-world
constraints by introducing a general design that operates over rate-limited
wireless channels. Further, we aim to tackle the rate-limit constraint,
represented through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, by employing the
density ratio trick alongside the implicit optimal prior method (IoPm). By
applying the IoPm to our multi-task processing framework, we propose a hybrid
learning approach that combines deep neural networks with kernelized-parametric
machine learning methods, enabling a robust solution for the CMT-SemCom. Our
framework is grounded in information-theoretic principles and employs
variational approximations to bridge theoretical foundations with practical
implementations. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed system's
effectiveness in rate-constrained multi-task SemCom scenarios, highlighting its
potential for enabling intelligence in next-generation wireless networks.

### [8] [Tram Positioning with Map-Enabled GNSS Data Reconciliation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08032)
*Jakub Kašpar,Vít Fanta,Vladimír Havlena*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用GNSS观测数据和轨道图的自定义处理方法来解决电车定位问题，通过IEKF算法在密集城市环境中提升定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于密集城市环境中GNSS信号的多径传播问题导致定位性能不佳，需要一种更有效的定位方法。

Method: 采用迭代扩展卡尔曼滤波器（IEKF）处理GNSS观测数据，该方法具有线性复杂度。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方案在模拟和真实数据中均优于基线定位方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为概念验证，未来可通过模型库方法或异常值剔除进一步优化性能。

Abstract: This paper presents an approach to tackle the problem of tram localization
through utilizing a custom processing of Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) observables and the track map. The method is motivated by suboptimal
performance in dense urban environments where the direct line of sight to GNSS
satellites is often obscured which leads to multipath propagation of GNSS
signals. The presented concept is based upon the iterated extended Kalman
filter (IEKF) and has linear complexity (with respect to the number of GNSS
measurements) as opposed to some other techniques mitigating the multipath
signal propagation. The technique is demonstrated both on a simulated example
and real data. The root-mean-squared errors from the simulated ground truth
positions show that the presented solution is able to improve performance
compared to a baseline localization approach. Similar result is achieved for
the experiment with real data, while treating orthogonal projections onto the
tram track as the true position, which is unavailable in the realistic
scenario. This proof-of-concept shows results which may be further improved
with implementation of a bank-of-models method or $\chi^2$-based rejection of
outlying GNSS pseudorange measurements.

### [9] [Learning-Based Multiuser Scheduling in MIMO-OFDM Systems with Hybrid Beamforming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08263)
*Pouya Agheli,Tugce Kobal,François Durand,Matthew Andrews*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 研究了多用户MIMO系统中的调度问题，使用混合波束成形技术以提高频谱效率和比例公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在混合波束成形系统中，由于多路复用增益有限，改进调度对提升频谱效率和长期性能至关重要。

Method: 采用两时间尺度协议，长期为用户分配模拟波束，短期调度用户并设计数字预编码器；提出组合算法（贪婪和排序）及机器学习方法。

Result: 数值结果显示性能与复杂度之间的权衡，具体方法选择取决于场景需求。

Conclusion: 研究表明，不同方法适用于不同场景，需根据具体标准选择。

Abstract: We investigate the multiuser scheduling problem in multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) and hybrid beamforming in which a base station (BS) communicates with
multiple users over millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the downlink. Improved
scheduling is critical for enhancing spectral efficiency and the long-term
performance of the system from the perspective of proportional fairness (PF)
metric in hybrid beamforming systems due to its limited multiplexing gain. Our
objective is to maximize PF by properly designing the analog and digital
precoders within the hybrid beamforming and selecting the users subject to the
number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Leveraging the characteristics of mmWave
channels, we apply a two-timescale protocol. On a long timescale, we assign an
analog beam to each user. Scheduling the users and designing the digital
precoder are done accordingly on a short timescale. To conduct scheduling, we
propose combinatorial solutions, such as greedy and sorting algorithms,
followed by a machine learning (ML) approach. Our numerical results highlight
the trade-off between the performance and complexity of the proposed
approaches. Consequently, we show that the choice of approach depends on the
specific criteria within a given scenario.

*Tal I. Sommer,Ori Katz*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 利用边缘衍射信号实现非视距（NLOS）声源的三维定位，提出了适用于门口和凸角两种场景的定位方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖可见反射面（如墙壁或地板）的间接信号，但在某些环境中可能受限，因此需要新的方法扩展NLOS声学传感的能力。

Method: 针对门口场景，利用门的两个边缘作为虚拟探测器阵列；针对凸角场景，利用刀刃衍射的光谱特征，模拟人类听觉的头相关传递函数（HRTF）。

Result: 提出了两种基于刀刃衍射的定位方法，能够在传统方法受限的环境中实现声源的三维定位。

Conclusion: 通过利用边缘衍射信号，该方法拓展了NLOS声学定位的应用范围，适用于传统反射面方法无法覆盖的场景。

Abstract: The detection and localization of a source hidden outside the Line-of-Sight
(LOS) traditionally rely on the acquisition of indirect signals, such as those
reflected from visible relay surfaces such as floors or walls. These reflected
signals are then utilized to reconstruct the obscured scene. In this study, we
present an approach that utilize signals diffracted from an edge of an obstacle
to achieve three-dimensional (3D) localization of an acoustic point source
situated outside the LOS. We address two scenarios - a doorway and a convex
corner - and propose a localization method for each of them. For the first
scenario, we utilize the two edges of the door as virtual detector arrays. For
the second scenario, we exploit the spectral signature of a knife-edge
diffraction, inspired by the human perception of sound location by the
head-related transfer function (HRTF). In both methods, knife-edge diffraction
is utilized to extend the capabilities of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) acoustic
sensing, enabling localization in environments where conventional relay-surface
based approaches may be limited.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网中节点电池动态建模面临挑战，传统方法难以泛化且无法捕捉未建模的残差动态。UDEs框架为这一问题提供了解决方案。

Method: 通过将神经残差嵌入物理启发的电池ODE中，UDEs学习节点特定电池演化。使用合成但真实的太阳能和负载数据进行模拟。

Result: 实验表明，UDE模型与真实电池轨迹高度吻合，收敛平滑，长期预测稳定。

Conclusion: UDEs在分散式能源网络中电池建模具有潜力，对可再生能源集成智能电网的实时控制和优化有广泛意义。

Abstract: Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), which blend neural networks with
physical differential equations, have emerged as a powerful framework for
scientific machine learning (SciML), enabling data-efficient, interpretable,
and physically consistent modeling. In the context of smart grid systems,
modeling node-wise battery dynamics remains a challenge due to the
stochasticity of solar input and variability in household load profiles.
Traditional approaches often struggle with generalization and fail to capture
unmodeled residual dynamics. This work proposes a UDE-based approach to learn
node-specific battery evolution by embedding a neural residual into a
physically inspired battery ODE. Synthetic yet realistic solar generation and
load demand data are used to simulate battery dynamics over time. The neural
component learns to model unobserved or stochastic corrections arising from
heterogeneity in node demand and environmental conditions. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that the trained UDE aligns closely with ground truth
battery trajectories, exhibits smooth convergence behavior, and maintains
stability in long-term forecasts. These findings affirm the viability of
UDE-based SciML approaches for battery modeling in decentralized energy
networks and suggest broader implications for real-time control and
optimization in renewable-integrated smart grids.

*Victor M. Tenorio,Madeline Navarro,Samuel Rey,Santiago Segarra,Antonio G. Marques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于结构引导的图神经网络（SG-GNN），通过为异质性数据创建新的图结构来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统GNN假设同质性且在异质性数据上表现不佳，本文旨在通过利用结构信息改善其性能。

Method: 通过链接具有相似结构属性的节点创建新图，设计SG-GNN处理原始图和新结构图，并自适应权衡其贡献。

Result: 在多个异质性基准数据集上，SG-GNN达到了最先进或高度竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 利用结构信息可以显著提升GNN在异质性数据上的表现。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with heterophilic data, where
connected nodes may have dissimilar labels, as they typically assume homophily
and rely on local message passing. To address this, we propose creating
alternative graph structures by linking nodes with similar structural
attributes (e.g., role-based or global), thereby fostering higher label
homophily on these new graphs. We theoretically prove that GNN performance can
be improved by utilizing graphs with fewer false positive edges (connections
between nodes of different classes) and that considering multiple graph views
increases the likelihood of finding such beneficial structures. Building on
these insights, we introduce Structure-Guided GNN (SG-GNN), an architecture
that processes the original graph alongside the newly created structural
graphs, adaptively learning to weigh their contributions. Extensive experiments
on various benchmark datasets, particularly those with heterophilic
characteristics, demonstrate that our SG-GNN achieves state-of-the-art or
highly competitive performance, highlighting the efficacy of exploiting
structural information to guide GNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着5G商用和6G研究的深入，光纤接入系统对高速数据服务的需求增长，传统OMA-PON难以满足高效和灵活的要求。

Method: 采用高维信号空间中的稀疏维度选择策略（S2D-strategy），将低维星座稀疏叠加至高维空间，减少多用户干扰。

Result: 仿真显示PD-SDCMA在25公里单模光纤系统中比PD-NOMA和3D-NOMA支持更多用户且误码率更低。

Conclusion: PD-SDCMA为灵活PON的演进提供了高效低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: With the commercial deployment of 5G and the in-depth research of 6G, the
demand for high-speed data services in the next-generation fiber optic access
systems is growing increasingly. Passive optical networks (PONs) have become a
research hotspot due to their characteristics of low loss, high bandwidth, and
low cost. However, the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA-PON) has
difficulty meeting the requirements of the next-generation PON for high
spectral efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, a novel transmission
technology, namely power-domain sparse dimension constellation multiple access
(PD-SDCMA), is proposed for the first time. Through the signal space dimension
selection strategy (S2D-strategy) in the high-dimensional signal space, the
low-dimensional constellation is sparsely superimposed into the
high-dimensional space, thereby reducing multi-user interference and enhancing
the system capacity. PD-SDCMA supports higher-order modulation formats and more
access groups, and is also compatible with the existing orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture. The simulation results show that in
a 25 km single-mode fiber system, compared with PD-NOMA and 3D-NOMA, PD-SDCMA
can support more users and significantly reduce BER. This technology provides
an efficient and low-cost solution for the evolution of Flexible PONs.

Abstract: This contribution is a follow-up of a recent paper by the authors on
adaptive, non-linear time-frequency transforms, focusing on the STFT based

Abstract: The application of small-factor, 5G-enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
has recently gained significant interest in various aerial and Industry 4.0

indoor environment, evaluating the UAV's ability to establish high-throughput,
low-latency communications in both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight
(NLoS) conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the 5G Aero meets the required
3GPP standards for Command and Control (C2) packets latency in both LoS and
NLoS, and video latency in LoS communications and it maintains acceptable
latency levels for video transmission in NLoS conditions. Additionally, we show
that the 5G module installed on the UAV introduces a negligible 1% decrease in
flight time, showing that 5G technologies can be integrated into commercial
off-the-shelf UAVs with minimal impact on battery lifetime. This paper
contributes to the literature by demonstrating the practical capabilities of
current 5G networks to support advanced UAV operations in telecommunications,
offering insights into potential enhancements and optimizations for UAV
performance in 5G networks

Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources
within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference
mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a
limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While
existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse
samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the
radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the
sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further
incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization
sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing
compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network
(RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter
adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio
propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to
adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by
the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate
obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic
decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor
prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the
performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.
