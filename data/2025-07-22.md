### [1] [Optimizing VO2max Prediction in Gamified Cardiac Assessment: Leveraging Effective Feature Selection and Refined Protocols for Robust Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14138)
*Vaishnavi C K,Sricharan Vijayarangan,Sri Gayathri G,Danush Adhithya N,Alex Joseph,Preejith SP,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的VO2max预测方法，通过优化Cardiopulmonary Spot Jog Test（CPSJT）协议和特征提取，提高了预测精度，同时降低了成本和操作难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VO2max测量方法（如CPET）成本高且操作复杂，限制了大范围筛查的可行性；早期尝试（如CPSJT）误差较大，无法广泛应用。

Method: 改进CPSJT协议，提取性别、BMI、有氧和无氧持续时间等关键特征，并测试多种机器学习模型（如线性回归、随机森林、SVR）。

Result: 在44名印度参与者中，所有模型的RMSE值较低（线性回归5.78，随机森林5.15，SVR5.17），表现出高相关性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 改进后的CPSJT结合机器学习模型，为VO2max提供了一种低成本且准确的预测方法，适合大规模应用。

Abstract: VO2max is a critical indicator of cardiopulmonary fitness, reflecting the
maximum amount of oxygen the body can utilize during intense exercise.
Accurately measuring VO2max is essential for assessing cardiovascular health
and predicting outcomes in clinical settings. However, current methods for
VO2max estimation, such as Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET), require
expensive equipment and the supervision of trained personnel, limiting
accessibility for large-scale screening. Preliminary efforts have been made to
create a more accessible method, such as the Cardiopulmonary Spot Jog Test
(CPSJT). Unfortunately, these early attempts yielded high error margins,
rendering them unsuitable for widespread use. In our study, we address these
shortcomings by refining the CPSJT protocol to improve prediction accuracy. A
crucial contribution is improved feature extraction which include gender, body
mass index, aerobic duration, and anaerobic duration. This targeted approach
helps in streamlining the model to enhance prediction precision while
minimizing the risk of overfitting. In a cohort of 44 participants from the
Indian population, we assessed the performance of various machine learning
models using these features. With Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation, the Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values were 5.78 for Linear Regression, 5.15 for
Random Forest, and 5.17 for Support Vector Regression. All models demonstrated
strong test correlations and low RMSE values, underscoring their robust and
reliable performance.

### [2] [DIVER-0 : A Fully Channel Equivariant EEG Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14141)
*Danny Dongyeop Han,Ahhyun Lucy Lee,Taeyang Lee,Yonghyeon Gwon,Sebin Lee,Seongjin Lee,David Keetae Park,Shinjae Yoo,Jiook Cha,Chun Kee Chung*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: DIVER-0是一种新型EEG基础模型，通过全时空注意力和创新位置编码技术，克服了现有模型在时空动态建模和通道排列等价性上的局限，实现了跨数据集泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型在时空动态建模和通道排列等价性方面存在局限性，阻碍了其在不同电极配置下的鲁棒泛化。

Method: 提出DIVER-0模型，结合全时空注意力、旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）和二值注意力偏差，并引入滑动时序条件位置编码（STCPE）以保持时空平移和通道排列等价性。

Result: DIVER-0仅用10%的预训练数据即实现竞争性能，且在多种通道排列条件下表现一致，验证了其跨数据集泛化的有效性。

Conclusion: DIVER-0为处理神经记录设置的异质性提供了关键设计原则，展示了全时空注意力在EEG建模中的优势。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique widely used in
brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications, yet existing EEG
foundation models face limitations in modeling spatio-temporal brain dynamics
and lack channel permutation equivariance, preventing robust generalization
across diverse electrode configurations. To address these challenges, we
propose DIVER-0, a novel EEG foundation model that demonstrates how full
spatio-temporal attention-rather than segregated spatial or temporal
processing-achieves superior performance when properly designed with Rotary
Position Embedding (RoPE) for temporal relationships and binary attention
biases for channel differentiation. We also introduce Sliding Temporal
Conditional Positional Encoding (STCPE), which improves upon existing
conditional positional encoding approaches by maintaining both temporal
translation equivariance and channel permutation equivariance, enabling robust
adaptation to arbitrary electrode configurations unseen during pretraining.
Experimental results demonstrate that DIVER-0 achieves competitive performance
with only 10% of pretraining data while maintaining consistent results across
all channel permutation conditions, validating its effectiveness for
cross-dataset generalization and establishing key design principles for
handling the inherent heterogeneity of neural recording setups.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating driving stress is vital for preventing accidents
and advancing both road safety and driver well-being. While vehicles are
equipped with increasingly sophisticated safety systems, many limits exist in
their ability to account for variable driving behaviors and environmental
contexts. In this study we examine how short-term stressor events impact
drivers' physiology and their behavioral responses behind the wheel. Leveraging
a controlled driving simulation setup, we collected physiological signals from
31 adult participants and designed a multimodal machine learning system to
estimate the presence of stressors. Our analysis explores the model sensitivity
and temporal dynamics against both known and novel emotional inducers, and
examines the relationship between predicted stress and observable patterns of
vehicle control. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of linking
physiological signals with contextual and behavioral cues in order to improve
real-time estimation of driving stress.

### [5] [Graph Convolutional Neural Networks to Model the Brain for Insomnia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14147)
*Kevin Monteiro,Sam Nallaperuma-Herzberg,Martina Mason,Steve Niederer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文利用脑电图数据和图卷积神经网络（GCNN）研究失眠症患者的大脑功能特征，开发了一种新的失眠分类模型，取得了一定效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有失眠治疗方法存在副作用，且缺乏基于大脑模型的研究，该项目旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 模型在窗口和受试者水平分别达到70%和68%的分类准确率，并发现特定脑区通道对模型性能影响较大。

Conclusion: 该研究为失眠症的大脑网络研究提供了新方法，并揭示了关键脑区的作用。

Abstract: Insomnia affects a vast population of the world and can have a wide range of
causes. Existing treatments for insomnia have been linked with many side
effects like headaches, dizziness, etc. As such, there is a clear need for
improved insomnia treatment. Brain modelling has helped with assessing the
effects of brain pathology on brain network dynamics and with supporting
clinical decisions in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, etc.
However, such models have not been developed for insomnia. Therefore, this
project attempts to understand the characteristics of the brain of individuals
experiencing insomnia using continuous long-duration EEG data. Brain networks
are derived based on functional connectivity and spatial distance between EEG
channels. The power spectral density of the channels is then computed for the
major brain wave frequency bands. A graph convolutional neural network (GCNN)
model is then trained to capture the functional characteristics associated with
insomnia and configured for the classification task to judge performance.
Results indicated a 50-second non-overlapping sliding window was the most
suitable choice for EEG segmentation. This approach achieved a classification
accuracy of 70% at window level and 68% at subject level. Additionally, the
omission of EEG channels C4-P4, F4-C4 and C4-A1 caused higher degradation in
model performance than the removal of other channels. These channel electrodes
are positioned near brain regions known to exhibit atypical levels of
functional connectivity in individuals with insomnia, which can explain such
results.

Conclusion: 研究验证了所提方法在低成本VLC系统中的高效性和实用性，为未来智能反射表面的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The integration of Optical Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (OIRSs) into
Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems is gaining momentum as a valid
alternative to RF technologies, harnessing the existing lighting
infrastructures and the vast unlicensed optical spectrum to enable higher
spectral efficiency, improved resilience to Line-of-Sight (LoS) blockages, and
enhanced positioning capabilities. This paper investigates the problem of
localizing a low-cost Photo Detector (PD) in a VLC-based indoor environment
consisting of only a single Light Emitting Diode (LED) as an active anchor, and
multiple spatially distributed single-element OIRSs. We formulate the problem
within an indirect, computationally efficient localization framework: first,
the optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators of the LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight
(NLoS) distances are derived, using a suitable OIRS activation strategy to
prevent interferences. To overcome the grid-based optimization required by the
ML NLoS estimator, we devise a novel algorithm based on an unstructured noise
variance transformation, which admits a closed-form solution. The set of
estimated LoS/NLoS distances are then used within a low-complexity localization
algorithm combining an Iterative Weighted Least Squares (IWLS) procedure, whose
weights are set according to the inverse of the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound
(CRLB), with an adaptive beam steering strategy that allows the OIRSs network
to dynamically align with the PD, without any prior knowledge of its position.
Accordingly, we derive the CRLB for both LoS/NLoS distance estimation and PD
position estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in terms of localization accuracy, robustness against OIRSs
misalignment conditions, and low number of iterations required to attain the
theoretical bounds.

Main category: eess.SP

Result: 实验证明，Self-DANA显著提升资源效率，减少CPU/GPU内存和时间消耗，性能达先进水平。

Conclusion: Self-DANA为减少通道配置的ECG分析提供高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale machine learning models trained on
extensive, diverse datasets that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream
tasks with minimal fine-tuning. In the last two years, interest in FMs has also
grown for applications in the cardiological field to analyze the
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. One of the key properties of FMs is their
transferability to a wide range of downstream scenarios. With the spread of
wearable and portable devices, keen interest in learning from reduced-channel
configurations has arisen. However, the adaptation of ECG FMs to downstream
scenarios with fewer available channels still has to be properly investigated.
In this work, we propose Self-DANA, a novel, easy-to-integrate solution that
makes self-supervised architectures adaptable to a reduced number of input
channels, ensuring resource efficiency and high performance. We also introduce
Random Lead Selection, a novel augmentation technique to pre-train models in a
more robust and channel-agnostic way. Our experimental results on five
reduced-channel configurations demonstrate that Self-DANA significantly
enhances resource efficiency while reaching state-of-the-art performance. It
requires up to 69.3% less peak CPU memory, 34.4% less peak GPU memory, about
17% less average epoch CPU time, and about 24% less average epoch GPU time.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需光刻的磷酸盐传感器（P-sensor），用于河流水体中磷酸盐的检测，灵敏度达1 ppb，响应时间短于30秒，结合神经网络预测，准确度高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 河流水质监测对水生生物、家畜和人类至关重要，磷酸盐等污染物的过量会导致富营养化，威胁健康和生态。

Method: 采用3D打印的周期性聚合物图案（8微米特征尺寸）涂覆磷酸盐选择性膜，制成固相指示电极，结合前馈神经网络预测磷酸盐浓度。

Result: 传感器在0-475 ppm范围内检测灵敏度达1 ppb，Rappahannock河水验证中与商业设备结果一致，神经网络预测误差低于1e-3，Pearson相关系数0.997。

Conclusion: 该传感器为连续水质监测提供了实用工具，可为决策者提供数据支持，改善公共健康。

Abstract: River water quality monitoring is important for aquatic life, livestock, and
humans because clean water is critical to meeting food demand during the global
food crisis. Excessive contaminants, including phosphate, deplete dissolved
oxygen and trigger eutrophication, leading to serious health and ecological
problems. Continuous sensors that track phosphate levels can therefore help
prevent eutrophication. In this work we present a lithography-free phosphate
sensor (P-sensor) that detects phosphate in river water at parts-per-billion
levels. The device uses a solid-state indicator electrode formed by 3D-printed
periodic polymer patterns (8 um feature size) coated with a thin phosphate
ion-selective membrane. The P-sensor detects as little as 1 ppb phosphate
across 0 - 475 ppm with a response time under 30 seconds. We validated the
sensor on Rappahannock River water, Virginia (less than 0.8 ppm phosphate) at
sites upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant and benchmarked the
results against a commercial phosphate meter. A feed-forward neural network was
trained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3,
zero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for
river samples. These results demonstrate a practical tool for continuous
water-quality monitoring that can inform stakeholders and policymakers and
ultimately improve public health.

Result: SVM准确率为83%，GCN-SVM提升至92%，显示出显著的神经肌肉差异。

Conclusion: 该方法在PD严重程度评估中具有潜力，未来需更大规模研究验证并应用于临床。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses challenges in diagnosis and monitoring due to
its progressive nature and complex symptoms. This study introduces a novel
approach utilizing surface electromyography (sEMG) to objectively assess PD
severity, focusing on the biceps brachii muscle. Initial analysis of sEMG data
from five PD patients and five healthy controls revealed significant
neuromuscular differences. A traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) model
achieved up to 83% accuracy, while enhancements with a Graph Convolutional
Network-Support Vector Machine (GCN-SVM) model increased accuracy to 92%.
Despite the preliminary nature of these results, the study outlines a detailed
experimental methodology for future research with larger cohorts to validate
these findings and integrate the approach into clinical practice. The proposed
approach holds promise for advancing PD severity assessment and improving
patient care in Parkinson's disease management.

Result: 在多种移动和流量模式下，实验结果显示其能稳定实现超95%的BLER目标，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效应对深度衰落和极端干扰，为超密集网络提供可靠的资源分配方案。

Abstract: Interference prediction that accounts for extreme and rare events remains a
key challenge for ultra-densely deployed sub-networks (SNs) requiring
hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC), particularly under dynamic
mobility, rapidly varying channel statistics, and sporadic traffic. This paper
proposes a novel calibrated interference tail prediction framework, a hybrid
statistical and machine learning (ML) approach that integrates an inverted
quantile patch transformer (iQPTransformer) within extreme value theory (EVT).
It captures interference dynamics and tail behavior while quantifying
uncertainty to provide statistical coverage guarantees. Its effectiveness is
demonstrated by leveraging the estimated interference tail distribution to
design predictive, risk-aware resource allocation. In resource-constrained SN
scenarios, we introduce the split-iQPTransformer, enabling collaborative
training by distributing neural network components between sensor-actuator (SA)
pairs and the SN controller, while maintaining minimal performance disparity
compared to the centralized iQPTransformer. The framework effectively handles
deep fading, random traffic, and time-division duplexing (TDD) misalignments
and is resilient to rare and extreme interference events. Extensive evaluations
are performed under two mobility models and two realistic SN traffic patterns,
using a spatially consistent 3GPP channel model across all scenarios.
Experimental results show consistent achievement of block error rate (BLER)
targets beyond the 95th percentile in the hyper-reliable regime, significantly
outperforming baseline approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏电生理学中，传统降噪技术难以应对信号中的非线性、非平稳噪声，影响了对心律失常和心肌病的准确诊断和治疗。

Method: 使用包含5706个时间序列的数据集，构建VAE模型以生成干净信号的表示。

Result: VAE模型在多种噪声类型下表现出优越的降噪性能，优于临床常用方法。

Conclusion: VAE能有效消除多种噪声，提升心脏电生理信号质量，可能提高治疗效果。

Abstract: In the field of cardiac electrophysiology (EP), effectively reducing noise in
intra-cardiac signals is crucial for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of
arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. However, traditional noise reduction
techniques fall short in addressing the diverse noise patterns from various
sources, often non-linear and non-stationary, present in these signals. This
work introduces a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, aimed at improving the
quality of intra-ventricular monophasic action potential (MAP) signal
recordings. By constructing representations of clean signals from a dataset of
5706 time series from 42 patients diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy, our
approach demonstrates superior denoising performance when compared to
conventional filtering methods commonly employed in clinical settings. We
assess the effectiveness of our VAE model using various metrics, indicating its
superior capability to denoise signals across different noise types, including
time-varying non-linear noise frequently found in clinical settings. These
results reveal that VAEs can eliminate diverse sources of noise in single
beats, outperforming state-of-the-art denoising techniques and potentially
improving treatment efficacy in cardiac EP.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has
significantly advanced environmental monitoring (EM) by enabling cost-effective
and scalable sensing solutions. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) and
artificial intelligence (AI) are introducing powerful tools for the efficient
and accurate analysis of complex environmental data. However, current IoT
platforms for environmental sensing are typically limited to a narrow set of
sensors, preventing a comprehensive assessment of environmental conditions and
lacking sufficient computational capabilities to support the deployment of
advanced ML and AI algorithms on the edge. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a compact (17x38 mm2), multi-modal, MCU-based environmental IoT node
integrating 11 sensors, including CO2 concentration, volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), light intensity, UV radiation, pressure, temperature, humidity, visual
sensing via an RGB camera, and precise geolocation through a GNSS module. It
features GAP9, a parallel ultra-low-power system-on-chip, enabling real-time,
energy-efficient edge processing of advanced ML models directly on-device. We
implemented a YOLOv5-based occupancy detection pipeline (0.3 M parameters, 42
MOP per inference), demonstrating 42% energy savings over raw data streaming.
Additionally, we present a smart indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring setup that
combines occupancy detection with adaptive sample rates, achieving operational
times of up to 143 h on a single compact 600 mAh, 3.7 V battery. Our platform
lays the groundwork for innovative applications such as predictive indoor IAQ,
enabling efficient AI-driven on-edge forecasting for energy-efficient and

Abstract: Preclinical sleep research remains constrained by labor intensive, manual
vigilance state classification and inter rater variability, limiting throughput
and reproducibility. This study presents an automated framework developed by
Team Neural Prognosticators to classify electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings
of small rodents into three critical vigilance states paradoxical sleep (REM),
slow wave sleep (SWS), and wakefulness. The system integrates advanced signal
processing with machine learning, leveraging engineered features from both time
and frequency domains, including spectral power across canonical EEG bands
(delta to gamma), temporal dynamics via Maximum-Minimum Distance, and
cross-frequency coupling metrics. These features capture distinct
neurophysiological signatures such as high frequency desynchronization during
wakefulness, delta oscillations in SWS, and REM specific bursts. Validated
during the 2024 Big Data Health Science Case Competition (University of South
Carolina Big Data Health Science Center, 2024), our XGBoost model achieved
91.5% overall accuracy, 86.8% precision, 81.2% recall, and an F1 score of
83.5%, outperforming all baseline methods. Our approach represents a critical
advancement in automated sleep state classification and a valuable tool for
accelerating discoveries in sleep science and the development of targeted
interventions for chronic sleep disorders. As a publicly available code (BDHSC)
resource is set to contribute significantly to advancements.

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了干扰检测和定位的准确性，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system
(GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of
accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these
interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating
their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of
Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to
signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors.
Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources
for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth,
and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision
encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for
each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates
in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed
spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization
accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices
recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and
demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 新方法在低复杂度和高可靠性之间取得平衡，适用于密集工业子网络环境。

Abstract: We propose a novel interference prediction scheme to improve link adaptation
(LA) in densely deployed industrial sub-networks (SNs) with high-reliability
and low-latency communication (HRLLC) requirements. The proposed method aims to
improve the LA framework by predicting and leveraging the heavy-tailed
interference probability density function (pdf). Interference is modeled as a
latent vector of available channel quality indicator (CQI), using a vector
discrete-time state-space model (vDSSM) at the SN controller, where the CQI is
subjected to compression, quantization, and delay-induced errors. To robustly
estimate interference power values under these impairments, we employ a
low-complexity, outlier-robust, sparse Student-t process regression (SPTPR)
method. This is integrated into a modified unscented Kalman filter, which
recursively refines predicted interference using CQI, enabling accurate
estimation and compensating protocol feedback delays, crucial for accurate LA.
Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves over 10x lower
complexity compared to a similar non-parametric baseline. It also maintains a
BLER below the 90th percentile target of 1e-6 while delivering performance
comparable to a state-of-the-art supervised technique using only CQI reports.

Abstract: Human computer interaction has become integral to modern life, driven by
advancements in machine learning technologies. Affective computing, in
particular, has focused on systems that recognize, interpret, and respond to
human emotions, often using wearable devices, which provide continuous data
streams of physiological signals. Among various physiological signals, the
photoplethysmogram (PPG) has gained prominence due to its ease of acquisition
from widely available devices. However, the generalization of PPG-based emotion
recognition models across individuals remains an unresolved challenge. This
paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture that combines Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to address this issue. The proposed model
integrates the strengths of these architectures to improve robustness and
generalization. Raw PPG signals are fed into the CNN for feature extraction.
These features are processed separately by LSTM and TCN. The outputs from these
components are concatenated to generate a final feature representation, which
serves as the input for classifying valence and arousal, the primary dimensions
of emotion. Experiments using the Photoplethysmogram Dataset for Emotional
Analysis (PPGE) demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model achieves better
model generalization than standalone CNN and LSTM architectures. Our results
show that the proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN
architecture, as well as a CNN-LSTM model, in emotion recognition tasks with
PPG signals. Using metrics such as Area Under the Curve (AUC) and F1 Score, we
highlight the model's effectiveness in handling subject variability.

Abstract: We present a novel and interpretable framework for electrocardiogram
(ECG)-based disease detection that combines hyperdimensional computing (HDC)
with learnable neural encoding. Unlike conventional HDC approaches that rely on
static, random projections, our method introduces a rhythm-aware and trainable
encoding pipeline based on RR intervals, a physiological signal segmentation
strategy that aligns with cardiac cycles. The core of our design is a
neural-distilled HDC architecture, featuring a learnable RR-block encoder and a
BinaryLinear hyperdimensional projection layer, optimized jointly with
cross-entropy and proxy-based metric loss. This hybrid framework preserves the
symbolic interpretability of HDC while enabling task-adaptive representation
learning. Experiments on Apnea-ECG and PTB-XL demonstrate that our model
significantly outperforms traditional HDC and classical ML baselines, achieving
73.09\% precision and an F1 score of 0.626 on Apnea-ECG, with comparable
robustness on PTB-XL. Our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution
for edge-compatible ECG classification, with strong potential for interpretable

Abstract: The impedance network (IN) model is gaining popularity in the oscillation
analysis of wind farms. However, the construction of such an IN model requires
impedance curves of each wind turbine under their respective operating
conditions, making its online application difficult due to the transmission of
numerous high-density impedance curves. To address this issue, this paper
proposes an AI-based impedance encoding-decoding method to facilitate the
online construction of IN model. First, an impedance encoder is trained to
compress impedance curves by setting the number of neurons much smaller than
that of frequency points. Then, the compressed data of each turbine are
uploaded to the wind farm and an impedance decoder is trained to reconstruct
original impedance curves. At last, based on the nodal admittance matrix (NAM)
method, the IN model of the wind farm can be obtained. The proposed method is
validated via model training and real-time simulations, demonstrating that the
encoded impedance vectors enable fast transmission and accurate reconstruction
of the original impedance curves.

Abstract: Effective modern transportation systems depend critically on accurate Signal
Phase and Timing (SPaT) estimation. However, acquiring ground-truth SPaT
information faces significant hurdles due to communication challenges with
transportation departments and signal installers. As a result, Floating Car
Data (FCD) has become the primary source for large-scale SPaT analyses. Current
FCD approaches often simplify the problem by assuming fixed schedules and basic
intersection designs for specific times and locations. These methods fail to
account for periodic signal changes, diverse intersection structures, and the
inherent limitations of real-world data, thus lacking a comprehensive framework
that is universally applicable. Addressing this limitation, we propose an
industrial-grade FCD analysis suite that manages the entire process, from
initial data preprocessing to final SPaT estimation. Our approach estimates
signal phases, identifies time-of-day (TOD) periods, and determines the
durations of red and green lights. The framework's notable stability and
robustness across diverse conditions, regardless of road geometry, is a key
feature. Furthermore, we provide a cleaned, de-identified FCD dataset and
supporting parameters to facilitate future research. Currently operational
within our navigation platform, the system analyses over 15 million FCD records
daily, supporting over two million traffic signals in mainland China, with more
than 75\% of estimations demonstrating less than five seconds of error.

Abstract: Radar technology presents untapped potential for continuous, contactless, and
passive heart rate monitoring via consumer electronics like mobile phones.
However the variety of available radar systems and lack of standardization
means that a large new paired dataset collection is required for each radar
system. This study demonstrates transfer learning between frequency-modulated
continuous wave (FMCW) and impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar systems,
both increasingly integrated into consumer devices. FMCW radar utilizes a
continuous chirp, while IR-UWB radar employs short pulses. Our mm-wave FMCW
radar operated at 60 GHz with a 5.5 GHz bandwidth (2.7 cm resolution, 3
receiving antennas [Rx]), and our IR-UWB radar at 8 GHz with a 500 MHz
bandwidth (30 cm resolution, 2 Rx). Using a novel 2D+1D ResNet architecture we
achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 bpm and a mean absolute percentage
error (MAPE) of 1.42% for heart rate monitoring with FMCW radar (N=119
participants, an average of 8 hours per participant). This model maintained
performance (under 5 MAE/10% MAPE) across various body positions and heart rate
ranges, with a 98.9% recall. We then fine-tuned a variant of this model,
trained on single-antenna and single-range bin FMCW data, using a small (N=376,
avg 6 minutes per participant) IR-UWB dataset. This transfer learning approach
yielded a model with MAE 4.1 bpm and MAPE 6.3% (97.5% recall), a 25% MAE
reduction over the IR-UWB baseline. This demonstration of transfer learning
between radar systems for heart rate monitoring has the potential to accelerate
its introduction into existing consumer devices.

Motivation: 随着计算需求增长，传统有线互连在高数据速率和大规模数据传输中效率降低，需要无线通信解决方案，但机箱内多径散射限制了其性能。

Method: 采用RIS调整反射波相位，使多径分量在接收端结合形成脉冲状信道冲击响应（CIR），减少符号间干扰（ISI）。

Result: 实验验证了RIS在典型计算机机箱内的有效性，为未来数据处理器件的无线链路优化提供了可能。

Conclusion: RIS增强的SRWC有望提升当前和未来数据处理单元的无线通信效率。

Abstract: Processing the exponentially growing amount of data produced daily requires
efficient communication between different processing units in a computer.
Traditionally, wired interconnects have been used to maintain these data links
due to their energy efficiency and ability to support high data rates. However,
as computing demands continue to increase in size and speed, these wired
interconnects can become longer and less effective. One possible solution is to
enhance the wired interconnects with short-range wireless communication (SRWC),
which offers flexible resource allocation and the ability to broadcast data.
However, implementing SRWC inside a computer chassis presents challenges due to
multiple scattering. This scattering stretches the channel impulse response
(CIR), leading to inter-symbol interference (ISI) and limiting data rates. To
address this issue, we propose transforming the computer chassis into a smart
radio environment by utilizing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The
RIS elements adjust the phase of reflected waves so that the multipath
components combine at the receiver in a way that creates a pulse-like CIR. This
approach has been experimentally validated within a typical computer chassis.
The results of this study pave the way for integrating RIS-enabled SRWC to
enhance wireless links in both current and future data processing units.

expansive bandwidth. However, THz waves are inherently susceptible to severe
path loss and beam misalignment due to their narrow-beam characteristics. In
this context, this paper proposes a reconfigurable intelligent
surface(RIS)-assisted transmitter architecture for the THz-SWIPT system, which
enables end-to-end self-alignment for steady-state transmission. The proposed
system incorporates phase conjugate circuits to achieve self-aligned
beamforming, facilitating the dynamic tracking of mobile IoT devices without
the need for beam training. Additionally, active amplification within the RIS
arrays compensates for cascaded channel attenuation through an iterative power
cycle, thereby enhancing the energy transmission efficiency. Theoretical models
and simulations indicate that the proposed system significantly mitigates
sidelobe interference, achieving a transmission efficiency of up to 73.26% over
a 2 meter distance with self-alignment.

Conclusion: 分布式机器学习框架在6G网络中具有实现低延迟、高精度定位的潜力。

Abstract: Low-latency localization is critical in cellular networks to support
real-time applications requiring precise positioning. In this paper, we propose
a distributed machine learning (ML) framework for fingerprint-based
localization tailored to cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems, an emerging architecture for 6G networks. The proposed
framework enables each access point (AP) to independently train a Gaussian
process regression model using local angle-of-arrival and received signal
strength fingerprints. These models provide probabilistic position estimates
for the user equipment (UE), which are then fused by the UE with minimal
computational overhead to derive a final location estimate. This decentralized
approach eliminates the need for fronthaul communication between the APs and
the central processing unit (CPU), thereby reducing latency. Additionally,
distributing computational tasks across the APs alleviates the processing
burden on the CPU compared to traditional centralized localization schemes.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed framework achieves
localization accuracy comparable to centralized methods, despite lacking the
benefits of centralized data aggregation. Moreover, it effectively reduces
uncertainty of the location estimates, as evidenced by the 95\% covariance
ellipse. The results highlight the potential of distributed ML for enabling
low-latency, high-accuracy localization in future 6G networks.

Conclusion: 该方法为多调谐状态优化提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: This article introduces an advanced space mapping (SM) technique that applies
a shared electromagnetic (EM)-based coarse model for multistate tuning-driven
multiphysics optimization of tunable filters. The SM method combines the
computational efficiency of EM single-physics simulations with the precision of
multiphysics simulations. The shared coarse model is based on EM single-physics
responses corresponding to various nontunable design parameters values.
Conversely, the fine model is implemented to delineate the behavior of
multiphysics responses concerning both nontunable and tunable design parameter
values. The proposed overall surrogate model comprises multiple subsurrogate
models, each consisting of one shared coarse model and two distinct mapping
neural networks. The responses from the shared coarse model in the EM
single-physics filed offer a suitable approximation for the fine responses in
the multiphysics filed, whereas the mapping neural networks facilitate
transition from the EM single-physics field to the multiphysics field. Each
subsurrogate model maintains consistent nontunable design parameter values but
possesses unique tunable design parameter values. By developing multiple
subsurrogate models, optimization can be simultaneously performed for each
tuning state. Nontunable design parameter values are constrained by all tuning
states, whereas tunable design parameter values are confined to their
respective tuning states. This optimization technique simultaneously accounts
for all the tuning states to fulfill the necessary multiple tuning state
requirements. Multiple EM and multiphysics training samples are generated
concurrently to develop the surrogate model. Compared with existing direct
multiphysics parameterized modeling techniques, our proposed method achieves
superior multiphysics modeling accuracy with fewer training samples and reduced
computational costs.

Motivation: 传统EEG无法研究胎儿期脑活动，而fMEG数据质量差，需改进以填补这一关键空白。

Method: 开发基于双扩散桥的无配对扩散翻译方法，结合数值积分优化，训练于30例EEG和44例fMEG数据集。

Result: 方法在时间域误差降低5%，频率域完全避免模式坍塌，信号保真度接近完美。

Conclusion: 在EEG-fMEG翻译问题上达到新水平，为其他无配对信号翻译应用提供可能。

Abstract: Background and objective: Brain activity in premature newborns has
traditionally been studied using electroencephalography (EEG), leading to
substantial advances in our understanding of early neural development. However,
since brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of
this process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording
neural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography
(fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and
scarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer
the well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve
understanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better
detection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an
unpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which
notably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative
results at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired
dataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature
newborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that
our method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error
in the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the
frequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We
set a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our
developed tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis.
Overall, we also believe that our method could be reused for other unpaired
signal translation applications.

Result: 仿真验证了闭式表达式的准确性，MCR-IM系统的频谱效率高于现有系统，吞吐量提升16%-21%。

Conclusion: MCR-IM系统适合大规模、高速率的LoRa网络应用。

Abstract: We propose a multiple chirp rate index modulation (MCR-IM) system based on
Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences that overcomes the problems of low transmission rate
and large-scale access in classical LoRa networks. We demonstrate the extremely
low cross-correlation of MCR-IM signals across different spread factors,
showing that the proposed MCR-IM system also inherits the characteristics of ZC
sequences modulation. Moreover, we derive an approximate closed-form expression
for the bit-error rate (BER) of the proposed MCR-IM system over Nakagami-m
fading channels. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the derived
closed-form expression and demonstrate that the MCR-IM system achieves higher
levels of spectral efficiency (SE) compared to existing systems. In this
context, assigning multiple chirp rates to each user results in a reduction in
the number of parallel channels. To mitigate this issue, we propose a peak
detection based successive interference cancellation (PD-SIC) algorithm to
accommodate more users. Compared to orthogonal scatter chirp spreading spectrum
system that names OrthoRa, the MCR-IM system with PD-SIC algorithm achieves
lower BER levels. For a similar number of collision signals, the throughput of
the MCR-IM system is enhanced by 16% to 21%. Owing to these advantages, the
proposed MCR-IM is well suited for large-scale, high-rate LoRa network
applications.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) capabilities are envisioned to play a pivotal role in
future wireless networks due to their enhanced flexibility and efficiency.
However, jointly optimizing UAV trajectory planning, multi-user communication,
and target sensing under stringent resource constraints and time-critical
conditions remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an Age
of Information (AoI)-centric UAV-ISAC system that simultaneously performs
target sensing and serves multiple ground users, emphasizing information
freshness as the core performance metric. We formulate a long-term average AoI
minimization problem that jointly optimizes the UAV's flight trajectory and
beamforming. To tackle the high-dimensional, non-convexity of this problem, we
develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm capable of
providing real-time decisions on UAV movement and beamforming for both radar
sensing and multi-user communication. Specifically, a Kalman filter is employed
for accurate target state prediction, regularized zero-forcing is utilized to
mitigate inter-user interference, and the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is
applied for training the DRL agent on continuous actions. The proposed
framework adaptively balances the trade-offs between sensing accuracy and
communication quality. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves lower average AoI compared to baseline
approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the size of seated crowds
with commodity WiFi signals, by leveraging natural body fidgeting behaviors as
a passive sensing cue. Departing from prior binary fidget representations, our
approach leverages the bandwidth of the received signal as a finer-grained and
robust indicator of crowd counts. More specifically, we propose a mathematical
model that relates the probability density function (PDF) of the signal
bandwidth to the crowd size, using a principled derivation based on the PDF of
an individual's fidget-induced bandwidth. To characterize the individual
fidgeting PDF, we use publicly available online videos, each of a seated
individual, from which we extract body motion profiles using vision techniques,
followed by a speed-to-bandwidth conversion inspired by Carson's Rule from
analog FM radio design. Finally, to enhance robustness in real-world
deployments where unrelated motions may occur nearby, we further introduce an
anomaly detection module that filters out non-fidget movements. We validate our
system through 42 experiments across two indoor environments with crowd sizes
up to and including 13 people, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.04 and a
normalized mean square error of 0.15, with an average convergence time of 51
seconds, significantly reducing the convergence time as compared to the state
of the art. Additional simulation results demonstrate scalability to larger
crowd sizes. Overall, our results show that our pipeline enables fast, robust,
and highly accurate counting of seated crowds.

Conclusion: 通过HAPS和无人机的集成设计，实现了高效的通信与感知功能，为6G网络的集成系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative approach by leveraging uncrewed aerial
vehicles (UAVs) as base stations (BSs) and a high-altitude platform station
(HAPS) as the central processing unit (CPU) in an integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system for 6G networks. We explore the challenges,
applications, and advantages of ISAC systems in next-generation networks,
highlighting the significance of optimizing position and power control. Our
approach integrates HAPS and UAVs to enhance wireless coverage, particularly in
remote areas. UAVs function as dual-purpose access points (APs), using their
maneuverability and line-of-sight (LoS) aerial-to-ground (A2G) links to
transmit combined communication and sensing signals. The scheme operates in two
time slots: in the first slot, UAVs transmit dedicated signals to communication
users (CUs) and potential targets. UAVs detect targets in specific ground
locations and, after signal transmission, receive reflected signals from
targets. In the second slot, UAVs relay these signals to HAPS, which performs
beamforming to align signals for each CU from various UAVs. UAVs decode
information from HAPS and adjust transmissions to maximize the beam pattern
efficiency toward the desired targets. We formulate a multi-objective
optimization problem to maximize both the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for CUs and the echo signal
power from the targets. This is achieved by finding the optimal power
allocation for CUs in each UAV, subject to constraints on the maximum total
power in each UAV and the transmitted beam pattern gain. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing network
performance, resource allocation, fairness, and system optimization. Using HAPS
as the CPU, computational tasks are offloaded from UAVs, which conserves energy
and improves network performance.

Conclusion: 这一技术进步为6G网络提供了高度可重构和稳健的滤波器解决方案。

Abstract: Yttrium iron garnet magnetostatic wave (MSW) radio frequency (RF) cavity
filters are promising for sixth-generation (6G) communication systems due to
their wide frequency tunability. However, the presence of severe spurious modes
arising from the finite cavity dimensions severely degrades the filter
performance. We present a half-cone transducer that spatially tailors spin wave
excitation to selectively enhance the primary cavity modes comprising the MSW
filter passband, while strongly suppressing the undesired spurious modes.
Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experiments verify the
effectiveness of the spatially tailored technique. We utilize the half-cone
transducer to demonstrate a spurious-free, single-cavity half-cone MSW filter
(HC-MSWF) with an insertion loss (IL) of 2.4-3.2 dB over a frequency tuning
range of 6.3-16.8 GHz. Extending our study, we further demonstrate a
spurious-free, dual-cavity HC-MSWF with an unprecedented tuning range of 21.7
GHz (9.8-31.5 GHz) while maintaining a low IL of 2.9-3.8 dB. This significant
advance in performance will enable highly reconfigurable and robust 6G
networks.

Abstract: This work presents a high-resolution, ray-tracing-based channel modeling for
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite-to-ground links in a suburban environment at
X-band. Using simulations conducted in Wireless InSite, we develop a parametric
channel model that characterizes both large- and small-scale fading effects
across different satellite elevation angles. Large-scale fading incorporates
attenuation due to terrain-induced shadowing and dynamic environmental factors
such as weather conditions, and is compared with 3GPP NTN channel model.
Additionally, we quantify link degradation resulting from ground station (GS)
antenna misalignment, considering both fixed single-element and electronically
steerable phased-array antennas. Small-scale fading is modeled by fitting a
shadowed and non-shadowed Rician distribution to the fading statistics at
various satellite elevations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study to propose a comprehensive elevation-aware channel model for
satellite-to-ground propagation at X-band, integrating ray-traced environmental
dynamics, elevation-dependent fading, and phased-array beam misalignment
effects.

Abstract: A novel movable-element (ME) enabled simultaneously transmitting and
reflecting surface (ME-STARS)-aided secure communication system is
investigated. Against the full-space eavesdropping, MEs are deployed at the
STARS for enhancing the physical layer security by exploiting higher spatial
degrees of freedom. Specifically, a sum secrecy rate maximization problem is
formulated, which jointly optimizes the passive beamforming and the MEs
positions at the ME-STARS, as well as the active beamforming at the base
station. To solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem involving
highly-coupled variables, an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm
is developed, decomposing the original problem into three subproblems. In
particular, for the MEs position optimization subproblem, a gradient ascent
algorithm is employed to iteratively refine the MEs' locations within the
confined region. Moreover, the the active and passive beamforming subproblems
are solved by employing successive convex approximation. Numerical results
unveil that: 1) ME-STARS significantly improves the secrecy performance
compared to the conventional STARS with fixed-position elements; and 2) The
secrecy rate achieved by the ME-STARS gets saturated within limited movable
region size.

Abstract: A multiple-waveguide pinching-antenna (PA)-based multi-user communication
system is investigated. With a given number of PAs, two deployment strategies
are considered, namely the centralized PA deployment, where all PAs are
switched between waveguides to serve users in a time-division manner to avail
of beamforming gain, and the distributed PA deployment, where a single PA is
deployed on each waveguide to simultaneously serve multiple users by leveraging
the multiplexing gain. The spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by each deployment
strategy is analyzed: i) For the centralized deployment, the positioning
strategy of PAs on each waveguide is determined first with the aim of
maximizing the channel gain of the corresponding nearest served user. Based on
this, the corresponding system SE is derived. ii) For the distributed
deployment, the system SE under the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is first
obtained. To obtain an analytically tractable form, the stationary phase method
is utilized to approximate the system SE. The approximation result reveals that
the average inter-user interference can be negligible with a large waveguide
spacing and thus the simple MRT is appealing for PA-based multi-user
communications. Furthermore, the system SEs achieved by the two strategies are
compared in both the high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Our
analysis suggests that at high SNRs, the distributed deployment is superior to
achieve the maximal system SE, while the centralized deployment is more
suitable for the low-SNR regime. Finally, the theoretical analysis is verified
through simulations.

Abstract: Jamming cancellation is essential to reliable unmanned autonomous vehicle
(AAV) communications in the presence of malicious jammers. In this paper, we
develop a practical multichannel-aided jamming cancellation method to realize
secure AAV communications. The proposed method is capable of simultaneously
achieving timing/frequency synchronization as well as jamming cancellation.
More importantly, our method does not need the signal's/jammer's channel state
information. It only utilizes the knowledge of the legitimate sender's preamble
sequence that is available in existing communication protocols. We also analyze
the length of the preamble sequence required for successful synchronization and
signal recovery. Experimental results on the built hardware platform show that,
with a two-antenna receiver, the proposed method can successfully decode the
signal of interest even when the jamming signal is $40$dB stronger than the
communication signal.

Result: LAT解码器在短码极化码中实现了接近最大似然（ML）的性能，并表现出对多种码率和码长的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: LAT解码器通过创新设计显著提升了性能和泛化能力，为短码解码提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have emerged as promising deep learning (DL) tools
for modeling complex sequence-to-sequence interactions in channel decoding.
However, current transformer-based decoders for error correction codes (ECCs)
demonstrate inferior performance and generalization capabilities compared to
conventional algebraic decoders, especially in short-code regimes. In this
work, we propose a novel latent-attention based transformer (LAT) decoder for
polar codes that addresses the limitations on performance and generalization
through three pivotal innovations. First, we develop a latent-attention
mechanism that supersedes the conventional self-attention mechanism. This
architectural modification enables independent learning of the Query and Key
matrices for code-aware attention computation, decoupling them from the Value
matrix to emphasize position-wise decoding interactions while reducing context
correlation interference. Second, we devise an advanced training framework
incorporating three synergistic components: entropy-aware importance sampling
that emphasizes low-probability regions in the signal constellation space,
experience reflow that introduces empirical labels to improve characterization
of decoding boundaries, and dynamic label smoothing for likelihood-based
regularization. Third, we propose a code-aware mask scheme which allows dynamic
adaptation for varying code configurations. Numerical evaluations demonstrate
that the proposed LAT decoder achieves near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance
in terms of both bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) for
short-length polar codes. Furthermore, the architecture exhibits robust
generalization capabilities across diverse code rates and code lengths.

*Kareem M. Attiah,Wei Yu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了下行链路集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统中所需的最小波束形成器数目，分析了感知和通信性能的最优权衡，并给出了具体的数学界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ISAC系统中如何通过优化波束形成器数量，同时实现感知和通信任务的最优性能。

Method: 通过分析感知任务的克拉美罗界（Cramér-Rao bound）和通信任务的信干噪比（SINR），推导出波束形成器的最小数量界限。

Result: 在有干扰消除能力时，最多需要K + √(L(L+1)/2)个波束形成器；无干扰消除时，界限为√(K² + L(L+1)/2)。

Conclusion: 波束形成器数量界限与任务类型和干扰消除能力密切相关，尤其是无干扰消除时，通信波束形成器已可满足需求。

Abstract: Consider a downlink integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system in
which a base station employs linear beamforming to communicate to $K$ users,
while simultaneously uses sensing beams to perform a sensing task of estimating
$L$ real parameters. How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best
performance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds
on the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is
measured in terms of the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and
communications performance is measured in terms of the
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires
at most $K + \sqrt{\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the
ability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling
interference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes
$\sqrt{K^2 + \frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound
on the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task
individually. These results can be extended to sensing tasks for which the
performance is measured as a function of $d$ quadratic terms in the
beamformers. In this case, the bound becomes $K + \sqrt{d}$ and $\sqrt{K^2 +
d}$, respectively. Specifically, for estimating complex path losses and
angles-of-arrival of $N_\text{tr}$ targets while communicating to $K$ users,
the bound on the minimum number of beamformers scales linearly in $K$ and in
$N_\text{tr}$, assuming interference from sensing can be cancelled. When
interference cancellation is not possible, the following exact characterization
for the case of $N_\text{tr} = 1$ can be obtained: when $K=0$ or $1$, two
beamformers should be used; when $K \ge 2$, exactly $K$ beamformers should be
used, i.e., communication beamformers alone are already sufficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来的通信技术需要提高频谱效率，但FTN信号的快速加速会导致脉冲高度重叠，恶化PAPR性能，因此研究MIMO FTN的PAPR行为具有重要意义。

Method: 分析MIMO FTN在高斯符号和最优功率分配下的PAPR行为，考虑两种功率约束：固定发射功率和固定接收SNR。

Result: 研究发现PAPR主要由加速因子和功率约束决定，功率分配优化对高斯信号的PAPR行为没有影响。

Conclusion: 在MIMO FTN系统中，PAPR性能主要受加速因子和功率约束的影响，优化功率分配并不能改善高斯信号的PAPR行为。

Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist signaling serves as a promising solution for improving
spectral efficiency in future generations of communications. However, its
nature of fast acceleration brings highly overlapped pulses that lead to worse
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance. In this paper, we investigate
the PAPR behavior of MIMO FTN using Gaussian symbols under optimal power
allocation for two power constraints: fixed transmit power and fixed received
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Our findings reveal that PAPR is mainly determined
by the acceleration factor and the power constraint, but power allocation
optimization does not change the PAPR behavior for Gaussian signaling.

Abstract: Goal: Epilepsy remains under-diagnosed in low-income countries due to scarce

epilepsy biomarkers. Methods: We model EEG signals as spatio-temporal graphs,
classify them, and identify interchannel relationships and temporal dynamics
using graph attention networks (GAT). To emphasize connectivity biomarkers, we
adapt the inherently node-focused GAT to analyze edges. We also designed signal
preprocessing for low-fidelity recordings and a lightweight GAT architecture
trained on Google Colab and deployed on RaspberryPi devices. Results: The
approach achieves promising classification performance, outperforming a
standard classifier based on random forest and graph convolutional networks in
terms of accuracy and robustness over multiple sessions, but also highlighting
specific connections in the fronto-temporal region. Conclusions: The results
highlight the potential of GATs to provide insightful and scalable diagnostic
support for epilepsy in underserved regions, paving the way for affordable and
accessible neurodiagnostic tools.

TL;DR: MEETI是首个结合ECG原始波形、图像和文本的大型数据集，支持多模态AI研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ECG数据集多为单模态或双模态，难以支持真实场景下的多模态AI开发。

Result: MEETI为开发可解释、多模态心血管AI提供了基础。

Conclusion: MEETI填补了多模态ECG数据集的空白，推动了心血管AI的发展。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a foundational role in modern cardiovascular
care, enabling non-invasive diagnosis of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and
conduction disorders. While machine learning has achieved expert-level
performance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable
multimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of
publicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals,
diagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide
only single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to
build models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in
real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext
ECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw
waveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual
interpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes
beat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering
structured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model
interpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the
raw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature
parameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved
using consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports
transformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable
reasoning about cardiac health. By bridging the gap between traditional signal
analysis, image-based interpretation, and language-driven understanding, MEETI
established a robust foundation for the next generation of explainable,
multimodal cardiovascular AI. It offers the research community a comprehensive
benchmark for developing and evaluating ECG-based AI systems.

Conclusion: 无线联邦蒸馏在减少通信开销的同时保持了较高的学习性能，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation and growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to
the development of federated learning (FL). FL allows wireless devices (WDs) to
cooperatively learn by sharing only local model parameters, without needing to
share the entire dataset. However, the emergence of large AI models has made
existing FL approaches inefficient, due to the significant communication
overhead required. In this paper, we propose a novel over-the-air federated
distillation (FD) framework by synergizing the strength of FL and knowledge
distillation to avoid the heavy local model transmission. Instead of sharing
the model parameters, only the WDs' model outputs, referred to as knowledge,
are shared and aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the superposition property
of the multiple-access channel. We shall study the transceiver design in
over-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting
the power constraints of the transceivers. The main challenge lies in the
intractability of the learning performance analysis, as well as the non-convex
nature and the optimization spanning the whole FD training period. To tackle
this problem, we first derive an analytical expression of the convergence rate
in over-the-air FD. Then, the closed-form optimal solutions of the WDs'
transmit power and the estimator for over-the-air aggregation are obtained
given the receiver combining strategy. Accordingly, we put forth an efficient
approach to find the optimal receiver beamforming vector via semidefinite
relaxation. We further prove that there is no optimality gap between the
original and relaxed problem for the receiver beamforming design. Numerical
results will show that the proposed over-the-air FD approach achieves a
significant reduction in communication overhead, with only a minor compromise
in testing accuracy compared to conventional FL benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的检测器，用于处理FTN信号，通过固定核心层和域信息掩码来减少码间干扰（ISI），并采用分层滤波器分配策略以提高检测精度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的滑动核心CNN在处理FTN信号的ISI时效率较低，因此需要一种更高效且针对性的检测方法。

Method: 使用固定位置核心直接捕捉不同距离的ISI效应，并采用分层滤波器分配策略，前期分配更多滤波器以处理强ISI模式，后期分配较少。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在τ≥0.7时接近最优误码率性能，计算效率比M-BCJR提升46%-84%。

Conclusion: 首次提出固定核心CNN架构用于FTN检测，显著提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detector for
faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling that employs structured fixed kernel layers
with domain-informed masking to mitigate intersymbol interference (ISI). Unlike
standard CNNs with sliding kernels, the proposed method utilizes fixed-position
kernels to directly capture ISI effects at varying distances from the central
symbol. A hierarchical filter allocation strategy is also introduced, assigning
more filters to earlier layers for strong ISI patterns and fewer to later
layers for weaker ones. This design improves detection accuracy while reducing
redundant operations. Simulation results show that the detector achieves
near-optimal bit error rate (BER) performance for $\tau \geq 0.7$, closely
matching the BCJR algorithm, and offers computational gains of up to $46\%$ and
$84\%$ over M-BCJR for BPSK and QPSK, respectively. Comparative analysis with
other methods further highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposed approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application
of a fixed-kernel CNN architecture tailored for FTN detection in the
literature.

Method: 使用端到端深度神经网络，结合骨概率图作为注意力机制，直接从单平面波射频数据生成骨增强图像。

Result: 在多个指标上显著优于传统方法，如对比度和信噪比的显著提升。

Conclusion: BEAM-Net是一种高效且创新的骨增强超声成像方法，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Pocket-sized, low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) devices are
increasingly used in musculoskeletal (MSK) applications for structural
examination of bone tissue. However, the image quality in MSK ultrasound is
often limited by speckle noise, low resolution, poor contrast, and anisotropic
reflections, making bone images difficult to interpret without additional
post-processing. Typically, medical ultrasound systems use delay and sum
beamforming (DASB) for image reconstruction, which is not specifically
optimized for bone structures. To address these limitations, we propose
BEAM-Net, a novel end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) that performs
high-frame-rate ultrasound beamforming with integrated bone enhancement, using
single-plane-wave (SPW) radio frequency (RF) data as input. Our approach embeds
a Bone Probability Map (BPM), which acts as an attention mechanism to enforce
higher structural similarity around bony regions in the image. The proposed
approach is the first of its kind to incorporate bone enhancement directly into
ultrasound beamforming using deep learning. BEAM-Net was trained and evaluated
on in-vivo MSK and synthetic RF ultrasound datasets. This paper introduces the
Edge Preservation Index (EPI) as a new region-focused metric for evaluating
structural fidelity in bone-enhanced ultrasound images. The performance of
BEAM-Net was compared with conventional DASB and existing deep learning
architectures using the EPI, Contrast Ratio (CR), Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR),
Speckle Similarity Index (SSI), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
BEAM-Net showed substantial gains over SPW-DASB, achieving 51.4-51% higher CR
and 94.2-73.3% higher SNR on in-vivo MSK and synthetic RF datasets. It
outperformed multiple steered plane wave DASB (MPW-DASB), with 19.8-24.0%
improvements in CR and SNR on in-vivo MSK and 2.5-12.8% improvements on
synthetic data.

Conclusion: 癫痫独立分割方法对EEG记录丰富的患者更适用。

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic, noncommunicable brain disorder, and sudden seizure
onsets can significantly impact patients' quality of life and health. However,
wearable seizure-predicting devices are still limited, partly due to the bulky
size of EEG-collecting devices. To relieve the problem, we proposed a novel
two-stage channel-aware Set Transformer Network that could perform seizure
prediction with fewer EEG channel sensors. We also tested a seizure-independent
division method which could prevent the adjacency of training and test data.
Experiments were performed on the CHB-MIT dataset which includes 22 patients
with 88 merged seizures. The mean sensitivity before channel selection was
76.4% with a false predicting rate (FPR) of 0.09/hour. After channel selection,
dominant channels emerged in 20 out of 22 patients; the average number of
channels was reduced to 2.8 from 18; and the mean sensitivity rose to 80.1%
with an FPR of 0.11/hour. Furthermore, experimental results on the
seizure-independent division supported our assertion that a more rigorous
seizure-independent division should be used for patients with abundant EEG
recordings.

Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the robust beamforming design for an

Taking into account quantization noise, we aim at maximizing the radar
signal-to-quantization-plus-noise ratio (SQNR) while guaranteeing the minimum
required signal-to-quantization-plus-interference-plus-noise ratio (SQINR) for

a scenario involving a point target and uniform-resolution DACs, where the
globally optimal solution is obtained by applying the semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) technique. For more general scenarios, including those with mixed-DACs
and/or an extended target, we develop a low-complexity
majorization-minimization (MM)-based algorithm to tackle the problem
iteratively. Compared to the non-robust algorithm, the proposed algorithm
demonstrates improved detection performance under practical quantization.
Simulation results confirm the robustness and efficacy of our proposed
algorithm in low-resolution quantization scenarios.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) systems have recently attracted significant attention in
the field of wireless communications owing to their exceptional capability to
proactively reconfigure wireless channels via flexible antenna movements. In
this paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for an MA
array-enhanced downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where a
base station deploys multiple MAs to serve multiple single-antenna users. Our
goal is to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the
transmit beamforming, positions of MAs, successive interference cancellation
(SIC) decoding order, and users' corresponding decoding indicator matrix, while
adhering to constraints on the maximum transmit power and finite MA moving
region. The formulated problem is inherently highly non-convex, rendering it
challenging to acquire a globally optimal solution. As a compromise, we propose
a low-complexity two-stage optimization algorithm to obtain an effective
suboptimal solution. Specifically, in stage one, the SIC decoding order is
first determined by solving a channel gain maximization problem. Then, in stage
two, with the given SIC decoding order, the beamforming vectors, MA positions,
and users' decoding indicator matrix are iteratively optimized by capitalizing
on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation (SCA), and genetic
algorithm (GA). Simulation results unveil that the sum-rate performance of the
proposed MA-enabled downlink NOMA system significantly outperforms that of
conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. Moreover, the results also
show that the antenna position optimization in the proposed algorithm can
further enhance the advantages of NOMA over space division multiple access
(SDMA).

TL;DR: 论文提出一种基于Zak-OTFS的调制方案，解决OFDM中子载波间隔不灵活的问题，实现多用户无线资源分配的无冲突通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM中子载波间隔固定导致灵活性不足，Zak-OTFS在延迟-多普勒域能提供更灵活的时频资源分配。

Method: 设计了一种新的延迟-多普勒域脉冲成形方法，支持非重叠时频资源分配，基站通过匹配滤波器分离用户数据。

Result: 数值模拟表明，Zak-OTFS在多用户系统中可实现单用户性能，无需保护带。

Conclusion: Zak-OTFS波形在预测性方面的优势可成功应用于上行通信架构。

Abstract: Wireless users with different characteristics will be expected to share
spectrum in next generation communication networks. One of the great strengths
of wireless networks based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
is the ease with which different non-overlapping time-frequency (TF) resources
can be allocated to different users by simply shifting each user's signal in
time and frequency. However, a significant weaknesses of OFDM is the
inflexibility of sub-carrier spacing. Since OFDM does not allow users to have
different sub-carrier spacing, a single user subject to inter-carrier
interference causes carrier spacing to increase for all users. Zak-OTFS is an
alternative delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme, where, in contrast to
OFDM, the Input-Output (I/O) relation is predictable. We match the strength of
OFDM by designing a novel DD domain method of shaping the transmitted Zak-OTFS
pulse on the uplink that enables flexible non-overlapping TF resource
allocation. The base station (BS) receives a superposition of uplink signals
and applies individual matched filters to obtain the data specific to
individual users. We develop theoretical measures of interference between
users, and present numerical simulations for a vehicular channel model
representative of next generation propagation environments. We demonstrate
single-user performance in a multiuser Zak-OTFS uplink system without needing
to provision guard bands between TF resources allocated to different users.
These performance results demonstrate that the benefits of a predictable
Zak-OTFS waveform can be realized within an architecture for uplink
communication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型近场集成传感、计算和语义通信（NF-ISCSC）框架，利用流体天线（FAs）和语义通信优化数据率及隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决近场ISAC技术中高数据量和隐私风险的问题，需要通过语义通信和动态适应机制提高效率和安全性。

Method: 提出NF-ISCSC框架，结合流体天线和语义通信，通过联合优化问题（包括ISAC波束成形、FA定位和语义提取比）并使用交替优化方法解决。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该框架在提高数据率的同时，能更好地保护隐私。

Conclusion: NF-ISCSC框架为下一代通信技术提供了一种高效、安全的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for
next-generation technologies. With high-frequency bands and large-scale antenna
arrays, the Rayleigh distance extends, necessitating near-field (NF) models
where waves are spherical. Although NF-ISAC improves both sensing and
communication, it also poses challenges such as high data volume and potential
privacy risks. To address these, we propose a novel framework: near-field
integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (NF-ISCSC), which
leverages semantic communication to transmit contextual information only,
thereby reducing data overhead and improving efficiency. However, semantic
communication is sensitive to channel variations, requiring adaptive
mechanisms. To this end, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced to support the
NF-ISCSC system, enabling dynamic adaptability to changing channels. The
proposed FA-enabled NF-ISCSC framework considers multiple communication users
and extended targets comprising several scatterers. A joint optimization
problem is formulated to maximize data rate while accounting for sensing
quality, computational load, and power budget. Using an alternating
optimization (AO) approach, the original problem is divided into three
sub-problems: ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction ratio.
Beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation method. FA
positioning is solved via a projected Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)
algorithm, and the semantic extraction ratio is optimized using bisection
search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves
higher data rates and better privacy preservation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于参数高效微调（PEFT）的基础模型方法，用于唇腭裂（CLP）检测和严重程度分类，实验结果显示其性能显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 唇腭裂中随严重程度增加的鼻音化导致发音异常，传统方法难以捕捉这些特征，而基础模型通过微调可更好地分类严重程度。

Method: 使用自监督模型Wav2Vec2、WavLM和弱监督Whisper提取特征，结合SVM分类器，并与传统手工特征eGeMAPS和ComParE对比。最后用LoRA和DoRA微调Whisper模型。

Result: 在NMCPC数据集上，F1分数相对提升26.4%和63.4%；在AIISH数据集上提升6.1%和52.9%。

Conclusion: PEFT方法能有效提升基础模型在CLP任务上的性能，显著优于传统手工特征和未微调模型。

Abstract: We propose the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of foundation
models for cleft lip and palate (CLP) detection and severity classification. In
CLP, nasalization increases with severity due to the abnormal passage between
the oral and nasal tracts; this causes oral stops to be replaced by glottal
stops and alters formant trajectories and vowel space. Since foundation models
are trained for grapheme prediction or long-term quantized representation
prediction, they may better discriminate CLP severity when fine-tuned on
domain-specific data. We conduct experiments on two datasets: English (NMCPC)
and Kannada (AIISH). We perform a comparative analysis using embeddings from
self-supervised models Wav2Vec2 and WavLM, and the weakly supervised Whisper,
each paired with SVM classifiers, and compare them with traditional handcrafted
features eGeMAPS and ComParE. Finally, we fine-tune the best-performing Whisper
model using PEFT techniques: Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) and Decomposed Low-Rank
Adapter (DoRA). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
relative improvements of 26.4% and 63.4% in macro-average F1 score over the
best foundation model and handcrafted feature baselines on the NMCPC dataset,
and improvements of 6.1% and 52.9% on the AIISH dataset, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法通常需要成对的干信号和混响信号数据，但在实践中难以获取。本研究旨在探索更实用的低资源训练方法。

Method: 采用序列学习策略，通过深度神经网络从混响输入中估计声学参数和干信号，并通过混响匹配损失进行指导。

Result: 最数据高效的变体仅需100个标注样本即可超越无监督基线。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在低资源场景中表现有效且实用。

Abstract: This paper explores the outcome of training state-ofthe-art dereverberation
models with supervision settings ranging from weakly-supervised to fully
unsupervised, relying solely on reverberant signals and an acoustic model for
training. Most of the existing deep learning approaches typically require
paired dry and reverberant data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. We
develop instead a sequential learning strategy motivated by a bayesian
formulation of the dereverberation problem, wherein acoustic parameters and dry
signals are estimated from reverberant inputs using deep neural networks,
guided by a reverberation matching loss. Our most data-efficient variant
requires only 100 reverberation-parameter-labelled samples to outperform an
unsupervised baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of the
proposed method in low-resource scenarios.

TL;DR: DWTGS提出了一种基于小波变换的频率正则化方法，通过监督低频子带并自监督高频子带来提高稀疏视图3DGS的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图3DGS在重建高质量新视角时容易过拟合高频细节，需要更有效的频率正则化方法。

Method: 使用小波空间损失进行空间监督，仅监督低频LL子带并自监督高频HH子带。

Result: DWTGS在多个基准测试中优于基于傅里叶变换的方法，改善了泛化性能并减少了高频幻觉。

Conclusion: 小波空间低频监督策略为稀疏视图3DGS的重建提供了一种更鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in
reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the
widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While
frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on
Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards
detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency
regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional
spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL
subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband
in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS
consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric
strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上取得了最佳性能，验证了架构和课程学习策略的必要性。

Conclusion: SST-CL框架为EEG情感识别提供了高效和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive
brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in
practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary
spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional
intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a
novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum
learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that
models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures
multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling
simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG
signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum
learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to
low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a
dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional
intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both
architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.

Method: 提出了CSG框架，通过联合优化问题，仅使用波束级RSRP数据估计CAPS并进行网格化；开发了CSG-AE模型，包含可训练的编码器、量化器和物理驱动解码器，并设计了PIDA训练方案。

Result: CSG-AE在合成数据上表现出色；在真实数据上，RSRP预测误差比基线降低30%（Active MAE）和65%（Overall MAE），同时提升了信道一致性和聚类平衡。

Conclusion: CSG框架在网格化效率和数据一致性方面取得了显著进步，推动了大规模网络优化的发展。

Abstract: Gridization, the process of partitioning space into grids where users share
similar channel characteristics, serves as a fundamental prerequisite for
efficient large-scale network optimization. However, existing methods like
Geographical or Beam Space Gridization (GSG or BSG) are limited by reliance on
unavailable location data or the flawed assumption that similar signal
strengths imply similar channel properties. We propose Channel Space
Gridization (CSG), a pioneering framework that unifies channel estimation and
gridization for the first time. Formulated as a joint optimization problem, CSG
uses only beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) to estimate Channel
Angle Power Spectra (CAPS) and partition samples into grids with homogeneous
channel characteristics. To perform CSG, we develop the CSG Autoencoder
(CSG-AE), featuring a trainable RSRP-to-CAPS encoder, a learnable sparse
codebook quantizer, and a physics-informed decoder based on the Localized
Statistical Channel Model. On recognizing the limitations of naive training
scheme, we propose a novel Pretraining-Initialization-Detached-Asynchronous
(PIDA) training scheme for CSG-AE, ensuring stable and effective training by
systematically addressing the common pitfalls of the naive training paradigm.
Evaluations reveal that CSG-AE excels in CAPS estimation accuracy and
clustering quality on synthetic data. On real-world datasets, it reduces Active
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 30\% and Overall MAE by 65\% on RSRP prediction
accuracy compared to salient baselines using the same data, while improving
channel consistency, cluster sizes balance, and active ratio, advancing the
development of gridization for large-scale network optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦分割学习(FSL)虽能降低边缘设备计算负担，但通信开销大且服务器存储需求高，需要改进。

Method: 通过辅助网络本地更新客户端权重，服务器仅维护单一模型，并选择性地传输数据以减少通信量。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，CSE-FSL显著降低了通信开销并减少了服务器存储需求。

Conclusion: CSE-FSL是一种高效且可扩展的联邦分割学习方法，适用于实际联邦学习任务。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is one of the popular distributed machine learning
(ML) solutions but incurs significant communication and computation costs at
edge devices. Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel
and reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model
architecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to
transmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in
every global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial
models for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage
efficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an
auxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a
single model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients
from the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server.
Additionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in
selected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We
provide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its
convergence under non-convex loss functions. The extensive experimental results
further indicate that CSE-FSL achieves a significant communication reduction
over existing FSL solutions using real-world FL tasks.

Abstract: Historically, the design of antenna arrays has evolved separately from
Shannon theory. Shannon theory adopts a probabilistic approach in the design of
communication systems, while antenna design approaches have relied on the
deterministic Maxwell theory alone. In this paper, we investigate an
information-theoretic analysis approach which we apply to evaluate the design
of a dual-band, dual-polarized multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array on a
cellphone. To this end, we use ANSYS HFSS, a commercial electromagnetic (EM)
simulation software suitable for the numerical optimization of antenna systems.
HFSS is used to obtain an accurate model of the cellphone MIMO antenna array
and HFSS SBR+ is utilized to obtain channel matrices for a large number of
users. Taking advantage of linear and optimal processing at the cellphone, we
estimate the outage probability curves. The curves are then used to determine
the diversity gain in a moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and the
multiplexing gain at a high SNR regime. This approach is then compared with the
method of estimating the diversity gain from the envelope correlation
coefficients or the beam-coupling matrix showing substantial differences in the
two methodologies.

Abstract: This work considers uplink asynchronous massive machine-type communications,
where a large number of low-power and low-cost devices asynchronously transmit
short packets to an access point equipped with multiple receive antennas. If
orthogonal preambles are employed, massive collisions will occur due to the
limited number of orthogonal preambles given the preamble sequence length. To
address this problem, we propose a delay-calibrated joint user activity
detection, channel estimation, and data detection algorithm, and investigate
the benefits of oversampling in estimating continuous-valued time delays at the
receiver. The proposed algorithm is based on the expectation-maximization
method, which alternately estimates the delays and detects active users and
their channels and data by noting that the collided users have different
delays. Under the Bayesian inference framework, we develop a computationally
efficient iterative algorithm using the approximate message passing principle
to resolve the joint user activity detection, channel estimation, and data
detection problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm in terms of the normalized mean-squared errors of channel
and data symbols, and the probability of misdetection.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂干扰和信道条件下展现了强大的鲁棒性，适合移动干扰源场景。

Abstract: The inherent vulnerability of wireless communication necessitates strategies
to enhance its security, particularly in the face of jamming attacks. This
paper uses the collaborations of multiple sensing nodes (SNs) in the wireless
network to present a cooperative anti-jamming approach (CAJ) designed to
neutralize the impact of jamming attacks. We propose an eigenvector (EV) method
to estimate the direction of the channel vector from pilot symbols. Through our
analysis, we demonstrate that with an adequate number of pilot symbols, the
performance of the proposed EV method is comparable to the scenario where the
perfect channel state information (CSI) is utilized. Both analytical formulas
and simulations illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed EV-CAJ
under strong jamming signals. Considering severe jamming, the proposed EV-CAJ
method exhibits only a 0.7 dB degradation compared to the case without jamming
especially when the number of SNs is significantly larger than the number of
jamming nodes (JNs). Moreover, the extension of the proposed method can handle
multiple jammers at the expense of degrees of freedom (DoF). We also
investigate the method's ability to remain robust in fast-fading channels with
different coherence times. Our proposed approach demonstrates good resilience,
particularly when the ratio of the channel's coherence time to the time frame
is small. This is especially important in the case of mobile jammers with large
Doppler shifts.

Result: 原型系统测试显示，该方法在主动感知任务中优于基准方法（如MUSIC），并将SNR提升约10 dB。

Conclusion: 通过盲配置MTS，不仅优化了信道强度，还实现了发射机定位，仅需RSS数据。

Abstract: Metasurface (MTS) comprises an array of metaatoms, each reflecting and
inducing a phase shift into the incident wireless signal. We seek the optimal
combination of phase shifts across all the meta-atoms to maximize the channel
strength from transmitter to receiver. Unlike many existing works that heavily
rely on channel state information (CSI), this paper proposes a statistical
approach to the phase shift optimization in the absence of CSI, namely blind
configuration or zero-order optimization. The main idea is to extract the key
features of the wireless environment from the received signal strength (RSS)
data via conditional sample mean, with provable performance. Furthermore, as a
windfall profit, we show that the proposed blind configuration method has a
nontrivial connection to phase retrieval which can be utilized for active
sensing. In a nutshell, by configuring a pair of MTSs blindly without channel
estimation, we not only enhance the channel strength to facilitate wireless
communication, but also enable receiver to localize transmitter. All we need is
the RSS data that can be readily measured at receiver. Our algorithm is
verified in prototype systems in the 2.6 GHz spectral band. As shown in field
tests, the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks (e.g., MUSIC) in the
active sensing task, and in the meanwhile raises the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) significantly by about 10 dB.

Result: 数值仿真显示性能显著优于基准方法，并对量化负载的鲁棒性进行了分析。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效地解锁了RA阵列的解决方案空间，并通过高效算法实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: The emerging reconfigurable antenna (RA) array technology promises capacity
enhancement through dynamic antenna positioning. Traditional approaches enforce
half-wavelength or greater spacing among RA elements to avoid mutual coupling,
limiting the solution space. Additionally, achieving sufficient spatial channel
sampling requires numerous discrete RA positions (ports), while high-frequency
scenarios with hybrid processing demand many physical RAs to maintain array
gains. This leads to exponential growth in the solution space. We propose two
techniques to address the former challenge: (1) surrounding a limited number of
active RAs with passive ones terminated to tunable analog loads to
\textit{exploit} mutual coupling and increase array gain, and (2) employing
tunable loads on each RA in an all-active design to \textit{eliminate} mutual
coupling in the analog domain. Both methods enable arbitrary RA spacing,
unlocking the full solution space. Regarding the latter challenge, we develop
greedy and meta-heuristic port selection algorithms, alongside low-complexity
heuristic variants, that efficiently handle over $10^{20}$ array
configurations, and optimize the loading values to maximize the sum-rate in a
multiple-input single-output broadcast channel under transmission power
constraints, assuming a heuristic linear precoder. Furthermore, we analyze
performance degradation from quantized loads and propose corresponding robust
designs. Numerical simulations reveal significant performance gains over
benchmarks and provide valuable insights.

Conclusion: 研究为服务器共谋环境下的语义PIR问题提供了理论基础和实用方案，扩展了PIR的研究范围。

Abstract: We study the problem of semantic private information retrieval (Sem-PIR) with
$T$ colluding servers (Sem-TPIR), i.e., servers that collectively share user
queries. In Sem-TPIR, the message sizes are different, and message retrieval
probabilities by any user are not uniform. This is a generalization of the
classical PIR problem where the message sizes are equal and message retrieval
probabilities are identical. The earlier work on Sem-PIR considered the case of
no collusions, i.e., the collusion parameter of $T=1$. In this paper, we
consider the general problem for arbitrary $T < N$. We find an upper bound on
the retrieval rate and design a scheme that achieves this rate, i.e., we derive
the exact capacity of Sem-TPIR.

Abstract: Brain foundation models represent a new frontier in AI: instead of processing
text or images, these models interpret real-time neural signals from EEG, fMRI,
and other neurotechnologies. When integrated with brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs), they may enable transformative applications-from thought controlled
devices to neuroprosthetics-by interpreting and acting on brain activity in
milliseconds. However, these same systems pose unprecedented risks, including
the exploitation of subconscious neural signals and the erosion of cognitive
liberty. Users cannot easily observe or control how their brain signals are
interpreted, creating power asymmetries that are vulnerable to manipulation.
This paper proposes embedding fiduciary duties-loyalty, care, and
confidentiality-directly into BCI-integrated brain foundation models through
technical design. Drawing on legal traditions and recent advancements in AI
alignment techniques, we outline implementable architectural and governance
mechanisms to ensure these systems act in users' best interests. Placing brain
foundation models on a fiduciary footing is essential to realizing their
potential without compromising self-determination.

Abstract: Novel AI-based arc fault diagnosis models have demonstrated outstanding
performance in terms of classification accuracy. However, an inherent problem
is whether these models can actually be trusted to find arc faults. In this
light, this work proposes a soft evaluation indicator that explains the outputs
of arc fault diagnosis models, by defining the the correct explanation of arc
faults and leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence and real arc fault
experiments. Meanwhile, a lightweight balanced neural network is proposed to
guarantee competitive accuracy and soft feature extraction score. In our
experiments, several traditional machine learning methods and deep learning
methods across two arc fault datasets with different sample times and noise
levels are utilized to test the effectiveness of the soft evaluation indicator.
Through this approach, the arc fault diagnosis models are easy to understand
and trust, allowing practitioners to make informed and trustworthy decisions.

Abstract: The expansion of the low-altitude economy has underscored the significance of
Low-Altitude Network Coverage (LANC) prediction for designing aerial corridors.
While accurate LANC forecasting hinges on the antenna beam patterns of Base
Stations (BSs), these patterns are typically proprietary and not readily
accessible. Operational parameters of BSs, which inherently contain beam
information, offer an opportunity for data-driven low-altitude coverage
prediction. However, collecting extensive low-altitude road test data is
cost-prohibitive, often yielding only sparse samples per BS. This scarcity
results in two primary challenges: imbalanced feature sampling due to limited
variability in high-dimensional operational parameters against the backdrop of
substantial changes in low-dimensional sampling locations, and diminished
generalizability stemming from insufficient data samples. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce a dual strategy comprising expert knowledge-based
feature compression and disentangled representation learning. The former
reduces feature space complexity by leveraging communications expertise, while
the latter enhances model generalizability through the integration of
propagation models and distinct subnetworks that capture and aggregate the
semantic representations of latent features. Experimental evaluation confirms
the efficacy of our framework, yielding a 7% reduction in error compared to the
best baseline algorithm. Real-network validations further attest to its
reliability, achieving practical prediction accuracy with MAE errors at the 5dB
level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地震反演方法依赖1D平均小波和不现实的横向分辨率假设，存在显著限制。

Method: 使用深度卷积神经网络(DCNN)和2D UNet架构，结合自监督损失函数(MSE+SSIM)，从合成数据中训练GINN。

Result: GINN能生成高分辨率IP和现实PSFs，与地质特征一致，横向分辨率噪声更低。

Conclusion: GINN方法优于传统1D小波，未来将进一步优化训练并验证实际数据。

Abstract: Model-based seismic inversion is a key technique in reservoir
characterization, but traditional methods face significant limitations, such as
relying on 1D average stationary wavelets and assuming an unrealistic lateral
resolution. To address these challenges, we propose a Geophysics-Informed
Neural Network (GINN) that integrates deep learning with seismic modeling. This
novel approach employs a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to
simultaneously estimate Point Spread Functions (PSFs) and acoustic impedance
(IP). PSFs are divided into zero-phase and residual components to ensure
geophysical consistency and to capture fine details. We used synthetic data
from the SEAM Phase I Earth Model to train the GINN for 100 epochs
(approximately 20 minutes) using a 2D UNet architecture. The network's inputs
include positional features and a low-frequency impedance (LF-IP) model. A
self-supervised loss function combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural
Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) was employed to ensure accurate results. The
GINN demonstrated its ability to generate high-resolution IP and realistic
PSFs, aligning with expected geological features. Unlike traditional 1D
wavelets, the GINN produces PSFs with limited lateral resolution, reducing
noise and improving accuracy. Future work will aim to refine the training
process and validate the methodology with real seismic data.
