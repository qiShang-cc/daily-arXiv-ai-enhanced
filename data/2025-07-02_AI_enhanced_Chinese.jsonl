The DL model can capture complex temporal features of\nhaptic time-series with the use of CNN and LSTM layers, followed by a\ntransformer encoder, and autoregressively produce a highly accurate estimation\nof the next force values for different teleoperation activities. By ensuring\nthat the estimation error is within a predefined threshold, the teleoperation\nsystem can safely relax its strict delay requirements.

Motivated by\nthis ability, in this study, we exploit the RIS to make the aggregate\nreflecting channels of different user terminals (UTs) as similar as possible to\nbe able to extract common group secret keys from their channels. Specifically,\nthe RIS will adjust its parameters to pave the way for group key generation\n(GKG) based on the physical channels of the UTs. Our method exploits the\nalready gathered channel state information (CSI) in the RIS to beneficially\ndesign the phase shifts and does not impose additional probing burden on the\nnetwork. Additionally, this scheme is broadcast-based and does not entail the\noverheads of the pairwise-based key generation. We consider both passive RIS\n(PRIS) and active RIS (ARIS) to generate the group keys. The PRIS is widely\nadopted in physical layer key generation (PLKG) studies due to its use of\npassive elements, whereas the ARIS demonstrates superior capability in aligning\nthe aggregate reflected channels among nodes in the GKG scenario, as\ndemonstrated in this study. We will exploit various optimization methods like\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation with Gaussian\nrandomization (SDR-GR) to address the raised optimization problems.

Although collaborative perception holds\ngreat promise, its performance is bottlenecked by wireless communication\nconstraints, as unreliable and bandwidth-limited channels hinder the\ntransmission of sensor data necessary for real-time perception. To address\nthese challenges, this paper proposes SComCP, a novel task-oriented semantic\ncommunication framework for collaborative perception.

To address these\nchallenges, this article presents an electromagnetic information theory-guided\nself-supervised pre-training (EIT-SPT) framework designed to systematically\ninject EM physics into WFMs. The EIT-SPT framework aims to infuse WFMs with\nintrinsic EM knowledge, thereby enhancing their physical consistency,\ngeneralization capabilities across varied EM landscapes, and overall data\nefficiency. Building upon the proposed EIT-SPT framework, this article first\nelaborates on diverse potential applications in 6G scenarios of WFMs, then\nvalidates the efficacy of the proposed framework through illustrative case\nstudies, and finally summarizes critical open research challenges and future\ndirections for WFMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u78c1\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff08EIT-SPT\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u7535\u78c1\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u65e0\u7ebf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08WFMs\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578bAI\u6a21\u578b\u57286G\u7f51\u7edc\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u5168\u606f\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u666e\u9002\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u539f\u751f\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86AI\u539f\u751f\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578bAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u78c1\uff08EM\uff09\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EIT-SPT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c06EM\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5d4c\u5165WFMs\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86EIT-SPT\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86WFMs\u57286G\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aWFMs\u7684\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684AI\u539f\u751f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The\napproach integrates Multi-Head Self-Attention and Long Short-Term Memory\nnetworks to capture spatiotemporal correlations in communication states.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, the\nproposed framework improves AoI optimization by up to 45%, accelerates learning\nconvergence, and adapts more effectively to dynamic VP environments on the\nAI4MARS dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u7ebf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08WFL\uff09\u7684\u8f66\u961f\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff08RACE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8f66\u961f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u8f66\u961f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u5bf9\u5076\u5206\u89e3\u914d\u7f6e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0eLSTM\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cRACE\u5728AI4MARS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u4e8645%\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u66f4\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "RACE\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8f66\u961f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u540c\u6b65\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8f66\u961f\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity\nfor multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and\nfrequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite\nmovement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within\nsingle-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the\nvast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in\nsuboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article\nproposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire\nmulti-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically\nforms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The\nformation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide\ntailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative\nstrategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial\nintelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite\naccess and mobility management.

Despite its\nadvancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from\nthe unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC)\nand (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model\nquantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically\naddresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility\nunder both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task.\nIn this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a\nprivacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different\nquantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we\nintroduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously\nachieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the\nproposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To\naddress quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization\ntechnique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation\naccuracy.
