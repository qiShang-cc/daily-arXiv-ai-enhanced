This challenge is further amplified under process, voltage, and\ntemperature (PVT) variations, which cause circuit behavior to shift across\ndifferent corners. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in\nautomating sizing for fixed targets, training a generalized policy that can\nadapt to a wide range of design specifications under PVT variations requires\nmuch more training samples and resources. To address these challenges, we\npropose a \\textbf{Goal-conditioned RL framework} that enables efficient policy\ntraining for analog device sizing across PVT corners, with strong\ngeneralization capability. To improve sample efficiency, we introduce\nPareto-front Dominance Goal Sampling, which constructs an automatic curriculum\nby sampling goals from the Pareto frontier of previously achieved goals. This\nstrategy is further enhanced by integrating Conservative Hindsight Experience\nReplay, which assigns relabeled goals with conservative virtual rewards to\nstabilize training and accelerate convergence. To reduce simulation overhead,\nour framework incorporates a Skip-on-Fail simulation strategy, which skips\nfull-corner simulations when nominal-corner simulation fails to meet target\nspecifications. Experiments on benchmark circuits demonstrate $\\sim$1.6$\\times$\nimprovement in sample efficiency and $\\sim$4.1$\\times$ improvement in\nsimulation efficiency compared to existing sizing methods.

However, these NNs are trained over diverse image distributions\nand thus often fail to reconstruct fine-grained image-specific details. To\novercome this limited reconstruction fidelity, we propose an extended SC\nframework, hybrid semantic communication (HSC), which supplements SR with\ncomplementary representation (CR) capturing residual image-specific\ninformation. The CR is constructed at the transmitter, and is combined with the\nactual SC outcome at the receiver to yield a high-fidelity recomposed image.\nWhile the transmission load of SR is fixed due to its NN-based structure, the\nload of CR can be flexibly adjusted to achieve a desirable fidelity. This\ncontrollability directly influences the final reconstruction error, for which\nwe derive a closed-form expression and the corresponding optimal CR.

We adopt a user-centric approach for communication user equipments\n(UEs) and a distributed sensing approach for multi-target detection. A\nheuristic access point (AP) mode selection algorithm and a channel-aware\ndistributed sensing scheme are proposed, where local measurements at receive\nAPs (RX-APs) are weighted based on the received signals signal-to-interference\nratio (SIR). A maximum a posteriori ratio test (MAPRT) detector is applied\nunder two awareness levels at RX-APs. To balance the communication-sensing\ntrade-off, we develop a power allocation algorithm to jointly maximize the\nminimum detection probability and communication\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while satisfying power\nconstraints. The proposed scheme outperforms non-weighted methods. Adding test\nstatistics from more RX-APs can degrade sensing performance due to weaker\nchannels, but this effect can be mitigated by optimizing the weighting\nexponent.

The algorithm is based on a\nreformulation of the SMDS, originally developed in the real domain, using\nquaternion algebra. By representing 3D coordinates as quaternions, the method\nconstructs a rank-1 Gram edge kernel (GEK) matrix that integrates both relative\ndistance and angular information between nodes, which enhances the noise\nreduction effect achieved through low-rank truncation employing singular value\ndecomposition (SVD), thereby improving robustness against information loss. To\nfurther reduce computational complexity, we also propose a variant of QD-SMDS\nthat eliminates the need for the computationally expensive SVD by leveraging\nthe inherent structure of the quaternion-domain GEK matrix. This alternative\ndirectly estimates node coordinates using only matrix multiplications within\nthe quaternion domain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method\nsignificantly improves localization accuracy compared to the original SMDS\nalgorithm, especially in scenarios with substantial measurement errors.

This\npaper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor\nwithin a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish\nkey theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under\nperfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources\ngrows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected\noutput conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,\nwhen only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall\nexpected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated\npredictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to\nachieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability\nrequirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot\nimprove the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new\ninformation about future channel states. Additionally, we show that\nwell-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that\nnecessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition\nthat the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to\noccur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous\nsimulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt\nscaling and isotonic regression.

In this setting, we establish a lower bound on the SPIR capacity,\ni.e., the maximum download rate, for general graphs, by proposing an achievable\nSPIR scheme. Next, we prove that, for any SPIR scheme to be feasible, the\nminimum size of message-specific randomness should be equal to the size of a\nmessage. Finally, by providing matching upper bounds, we derive the exact SPIR\ncapacity for the class of path and regular graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u5236\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff08SPIR\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6d88\u606f\u7279\u5b9a\u5171\u540c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6d88\u606f\u7279\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5927\u5c0f\u5e94\u4e0e\u6d88\u606f\u5927\u5c0f\u76f8\u7b49\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u56fe\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\u7684\u7cbe\u786eSPIR\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u5236\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u5bf9\u79f0\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5171\u540c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6309\u56fe\u590d\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684SPIR\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u7684SPIR\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6d88\u606f\u7279\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5927\u5c0f\u5e94\u4e0e\u6d88\u606f\u5927\u5c0f\u76f8\u7b49\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u8def\u5f84\u56fe\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u4ee5\u63a8\u5bfc\u7cbe\u786e\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u6210\u529f\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86SPIR\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6d88\u606f\u7279\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u8def\u5f84\u56fe\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86SPIR\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u5236\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u56fe\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}
