### [1] [Movable Antenna Enhanced Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Hybrid Client Selection Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00011)
*Yang Zhao,Yue Xiu,Chengxiao Dai,Ning Wei,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探索了可移动天线（MAs）在6G网络中优化大型语言模型（LLM）联邦微调的潜力，提出了混合SCA和PDD算法，显著提升了收敛速度和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 可移动天线辅助的联邦LLM微调在6G边缘智能中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training in 6G networks faces stringent latency
and energy constraints while operating over bandwidth-limited wireless links. A
commonly adopted workflow separates training into a centralized pre-training
phase and a federated fine-tuning phase on domain-specific data; however,
over-the-air (OTA) gradient aggregation during fine-tuning remains vulnerable
to fading and interference. This study explores the integration of movable
antennas (MAs), whose element positions can be reconfigured in real time, to
mitigate such channel impairments. An auxiliary channel representation embeds
transmit power terms in the effective gain, thereby removing explicit
power-control variables. We derive the convergence bound that determines the
relationship between the final fine-tuning loss to OTA noise and the
distribution shift between the two data stages, measured via the Wasserstein
distance. These findings lead to a mixed integer, nonconvex resource allocation
problem that jointly determines the numbers of global rounds, CPU frequencies,
mini-batch sizes, positions of MAs, and beamformers under latency-energy
constraints. We propose a hybrid successive convex approximation (SCA) and
penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm to solve the problem. Experiments
with the OpenLLaMA v2 model with 3 billion parameters demonstrate up to $95\%$
faster convergence and over $90\%$ lower total energy consumption relative to
the leading wireless federated learning baselines, underscoring the promise of
MAs-assisted federated LLM fine-tuning for 6G edge intelligence.

### [2] [STARS-assisted Near-field ISAC: Sensor Deployment and Beamforming Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00192)

Conclusion: 该框架通过优化设计和传感器部署，实现了高效的近场ISAC系统，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) assisted
near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is
proposed, where the radio sensors are installed on the STARS to directly
conduct the distance-domain sensing by exploiting the characteristic spherical
wavefront. A new squared position error bound (SPEB) expression is derived to
reveal the dependence on beamforming (BF) design and sensor deployment. To
balance the trade-off between the SPEB and the sensor deployment cost, a cost
function minimization problem, a cost function minimization problem is
formulated to jointly optimize the sensor deployment, the active and passive
BF, subject to communication and power consumption constraints. For the sensor
deployment optimization, a joint sensor deployment algorithm is proposed by
invoking the successive convex approximation. Under a specific relationship
between the sensor numbers and BF design, we derive the optimal sensor interval
in a closed-form expression. For the joint BF optimization, a penalty-based
method is invoked. Simulation results validated that the derived SPEB
expression is close to the exact SPEB, which reveals the Fisher information
Matrix of position estimation in NF can be approximated as a diagonal matrix.
Furthermore, the proposed algorithms achieve the best SPEB performance than the
benchmark schemes accompanying the lowest deployment cost.

### [3] [The Impact of Uniform Circular Array on Near-field ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00211)
*Na Xue,Xidong Mu,Yue Chen,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于均匀圆形阵列的近场集成感知与通信框架，利用圆柱坐标评估联合定位性能，推导了共面和非共面情况下的平方位置误差界，并提出了低复杂度算法优化性能。

Result: 数值结果表明：1）在近场传播中，角度和距离的Fisher信息矩阵可近似为对角矩阵；2）均匀圆形阵列在共面区域定位性能优于均匀平面阵列；3）VQF算法比传统SDR算法精度更高且计算更简单。

Conclusion: 研究成功验证了所提框架和算法的有效性，提升了近场集成感知与通信系统中的定位精度和计算效率。

Abstract: A novel uniform circular array (UCA) based near-field (NF) integrated sensing
and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed, where the Cylindrical
coordinate is invoked to evaluate the joint positioning performance. The joint
squared position error bound (SPEB) of the sensing target (ST) is derived for
the coplanar and non-coplanar cases. For the coplanar case, where the ST is
located in the coplanar region of the UCA, the approximate Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound
(CRB) expressions for the separate angle and distance estimation are given by
exploiting the uniform spherical wavefront model. A SPEB minimization problem
is formulated with the constraints of communication requirement and power
budget, where the closed-form solution to minimize the CRB of the angle is
derived. Inspired by the close-form expression, a low complexity vector-based
quadratic transformation (VQF) algorithm is proposed by invoking the Rayleigh
quotient. For the non-coplanar case, where the ST is located beyond the
coplanar region of the UCA, the separate CRBs over three-dimensional
coordinates and the joint SPEB approximations are derived. To minimize the SPEB
performance, the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method and extended
low-complexity VQF algorithm are proposed. Numerical results validated that i)
the Fisher Information Matrix about angle and distance in NF propagation can be
approximated as a diagonal matrix with the trinity loss; ii) Compared with the
uniform planar array, the UCA achieve better positioning performance when ST
located in the coplanar of the antenna array; and iii) the proposed VQF
algorithms reach higher solution precision than conventional SDR algorithm with
much less computation complexity.

### [4] [Power-of-Two (PoT) Weights in Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00315)
*Mahmoud Elgenedy*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过一种特殊的量化方法（Power of Two, PoT）降低大型语言模型（LLMs）的复杂度，以解决边缘设备上内存和计算资源有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs参数数量的指数增长（例如GPT3参数达1750亿），在边缘设备上实现这些模型面临巨大挑战，因此需要降低模型复杂度。

Method: 使用PoT量化方法对线性层权重和Transformer表进行量化，将乘法运算转换为位运算，从而减少内存占用和计算复杂度。

Result: 在Nano-GPT和124M GPT-2模型上的初步结果显示，PoT量化效果显著，交叉熵损失仅轻微增加（≈[1.3-0.88]），同时仅需4-6位表示幂次。

Conclusion: PoT量化方法在降低LLM复杂度方面具有潜力，尤其适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Complexity of Neural Networks is increasing rapidly due to the massive
increase in model parameters. Specifically, in Large Language Models (LLMs),
the number of model parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years,
for example, from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT2 to 175 billion in GPT3. This
raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices
where memory and processing power are very limited. In this work, we
investigate reducing LLM complexity with special type of quantization, power of
two (PoT), for linear layers weights and transformer tables. PoT not only
provides memory reduction but more importantly provides significant
computational reduction through converting multiplication to bit shifting. We
obtained preliminary results of PoT quantization on Nano-GPT implementation
using Shakespeare dataset. We then extended results to 124-M GPT-2 model. The
PoT quantization results are shown to be very promising with cross entropy loss
degradation $\approx$[1.3-0.88] with number of bits range [4-6] to represent
power levels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为5G毫米波应用提供低成本、单层结构的解决方案，同时实现波束扫描和滤波功能。

Method: 设计基于圆形衬底集成波导（SIW）腔的结构，包括馈电金属柱、模式控制金属柱和辐射缝隙，利用TM010和TM110模式实现性能。

Result: 两种filtennas的实测阻抗带宽分别达8.6%和10.1%，侧带抑制超过18dB，平均增益5.0dBi。

Conclusion: 该方案在5G毫米波应用中具有潜力，因其低成本、单层结构及优异性能。

Abstract: In this communication, two novel low-cost single-layer filtering antennas
(filtennas) are proposed for millimeter wave (mmWave) applications. The
proposed filtennas consists of a compact circular substrate integrated
waveguide (SIW) cavity, a metal post close to the center of the cavity for
power feeding, a metal post in the center for modes controlling, and a slot for
radiating power. In the passband, the fundamental TM010 mode and the TM110 mode
in the circular SIW cavity are excited by the feeding post. In addition, thanks
to the high-pass characteristics of the cavity, it exhibits more than 20 dB
suppression in the lower frequency band. There are three radiation nulls in
Filtenna 1 and one radiation null in Filtenna 2 in the upper band which
increase the suppression level as high as 18 dB. As a proof of concept, the
proposed filtennas are fabricated and measured. It is shown that the Filtenna 1
can achieve simulated and measured -10 dB impedance fractional bandwidth (FBW)
of 7.1% (27.14 - 29.13 GHz) and 8.6% (27.62 - 30.11 GHz), respectively. While
filtenna 2 can achieve simulated and measured -10 dB FBW of 7.4% (27.86 - 29.99
GHz) and 10.1% (28.11 - 31.09 GHz), respectively. The filtennas features stable
radiation patterns with an average gain of 5.0 dBi. The lower and upper
sideband suppression levels for both filtennas exceed 18 dB. These filtennas
are good candidates for 5G mmWave applications, as they simultaneously provide
beam scanning and filtering capability with a low cost, and single layer
structure.

Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based end-to-end (E2E) communication systems, in which
each system component may consist of a portion of a neural network, have been
investigated as potential tools for developing artificial intelligence
(Al)-native E2E systems. In this paper, we propose an NN-based bitwise receiver
that improves computational efficiency while maintaining performance comparable
to baseline demappers. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel
symbol-wise autoencoder (AE)-based E2E system that jointly optimizes the
transmitter and receiver at the physical layer. We evaluate the proposed
NN-based receiver using bit-error rate (BER) analysis to confirm that the
numerical BER achieved by NN-based receivers or transceivers is accurate.
Results demonstrate that the AE-based system outperforms baseline
architectures, particularly for higher-order modulation schemes. We further
show that the training signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly affects the
performance of the systems when inference is conducted at different SNR levels.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly
popular in wireless communication systems for several applications. A critical
bottleneck for designing ML systems for wireless communications is the
availability of realistic wireless channel datasets, which are extremely
resource-intensive to produce. To this end, the generation of realistic
wireless channels plays a key role in the subsequent design of effective ML
algorithms for wireless communication systems. Generative models have been
proposed to synthesize channel matrices, but outputs produced by such methods
may not correspond to geometrically viable channels and do not provide any
insight into the scenario being generated. In this work, we aim to address both
these issues by integrating established parametric, physics-based geometric
channel (PPGC) modeling frameworks with generative methods to produce realistic
channel matrices with interpretable representations in the parameter domain. We
show that generative models converge to prohibitively suboptimal stationary
points when learning the underlying prior directly over the parameters due to
the non-convex PPGC model. To address this limitation, we propose a linearized
reformulation of the problem to ensure smooth gradient flow during generative
model training, while also providing insights into the underlying physical
environment. We evaluate our model against prior baselines by comparing the
generated, scenario-specific samples in terms of the 2-Wasserstein distance and
through its utility when used for downstream compression tasks.

### [8] [A Family of Robust Generalized Adaptive Filters and Application for Time-series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00397)

Conclusion: RGA-AF及其变种算法在适应性和性能上均显著优于传统方法，为解决多噪声环境下的滤波问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The continuous development of new adaptive filters (AFs) based on novel cost
functions (CFs) is driven by the demands of various application scenarios and
noise environments. However, these algorithms typically demonstrate optimal
performance only in specific conditions. In the event of the noise change, the
performance of these AFs often declines, rendering simple parameter adjustments
ineffective. Instead, a modification of the CF is necessary. To address this
issue, the robust generalized adaptive AF (RGA-AF) with strong adaptability and
flexibility is proposed in this paper. The flexibility of the RGA-AF's CF
allows for smooth adaptation to varying noise environments through parameter
adjustments, ensuring optimal filtering performance in diverse scenarios.
Moreover, we introduce several fundamental properties of negative RGA (NRGA)
entropy and present the negative asymmetric RGA-AF (NAR-GA-AF) and kernel
recursive NRGA-AF (KRNRGA-AF). These AFs address asymmetric noise distribution
and nonlinear filtering issues, respectively. Simulations of linear system
identification and time-series prediction for Chua's circuit under different
noise environments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in
comparison to existing techniques.

Abstract: Recently, the proposal of the least mean square (LMS) and recursive least
squares (RLS) algorithm for graph signal processing (GSP) provides excellent
solutions for processing signals defined on irregular structures such as sensor
networks. The existing work has completed the steady state error analysis of
the GSP LMS algorithm and GSP RLS algorithm in Gaussian noise scenarios, and a
range of values for the step size of the GSP LMS algorithm has also been given.
Meanwhile, the transient error analysis of the GSP LMS algorithm and GSP RLS
algorithm is also important and challenging. Completing the above work will
help to quantitatively analyze the performance of the graph signal adaptive
estimation algorithm at transient moments, which is what this paper is working
on. By using formula derivation and mathematical induction, the transient
errors expressions of the GSP LMS and GSP RLS algorithm are given in this
paper. Based on the Brazilian temperature datasets, the related simulation
experiments are executed, which strongly demonstrate the correctness of our
proposed theoretical analysis

### [10] [Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00452)
*TaeJun Ha,Chaehyun Jung,Hyeonuk Kim,Jeongwoo Park,Jeonghun Park*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力机制的MMSE（A-MMSE）方法，通过Transformer学习最优MMSE滤波器，显著降低了计算复杂度，并在性能与复杂度之间取得了优异平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的MMSE信道估计方法需要难以获取的二阶统计信息，现有的深度学习方法则复杂度较高，因此提出A-MMSE以解决这些问题。

Method: 采用基于注意力机制的DNN框架（A-MMSE），训练后通过单线性操作实现信道估计，无需非线性激活；设计了双阶段注意力编码器以提升学习效率，并支持秩自适应扩展。

Result: 在3GPP TDL信道模型上的仿真表明，A-MMSE在各种SNR条件下均优于基线方法，尤其在性能与复杂度的权衡上表现突出。

Conclusion: A-MMSE及其秩自适应扩展为信道估计方法设立了新标准，实现了高效且低复杂度的优化。

Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel
estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as
minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order
statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural
networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often
suffer from high complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE
(A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter
via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel
through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear
activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To
enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention
encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure.
Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible
trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive
simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE
consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE
across a wide range of SNR conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its
rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance complexity
trade-off, redefining the standard for practical channel estimation methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于测量的耦合式ISAC信道模型，并通过相似性分析验证其准确性，适用于LoS和NLoS场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该模型有效捕捉了目标与环境的耦合效应，为ISAC技术设计提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) has been identified as a key 6G
application by ITU and 3GPP, with standardization efforts already underway.
Sensing tasks, such as target localization, demand more precise
characterization of the sensing target (ST) in ISAC channel modeling. The ST
couples complexly with environmental scatterers, potentially blocking some
multipaths and generating new ones, resulting in power variations compared to
the original channel. To accurately model this effect, this paper proposes a
coupled ISAC channel model based on measurements and validates it through
similarity analysis between simulated and measured channels. In this work, we
first conduct ISAC channel measurements in an indoor factory scenario at 105
GHz, where the multipath power variations caused by the ST's interaction with
the environment are clearly observed. Then, we propose an ISAC channel modeling
framework that incorporates two novel parameters: the Blockage-Region Coupling
Factor (BR-CF) and the Forward-Scattering (FS)-CF, which characterize the
spatial region and intensity of the coupling effect, respectively. Finally, the
proposed model is validated through similarity comparison with measured data,
demonstrating higher accuracy for both LoS and NLoS scenarios compared to the
non-coupled model. This realistic ISAC channel model provides an effective
framework for capturing the ST-environment coupling effect, supporting the
design and evaluation of ISAC technologies.

Abstract: We investigate the second-order characteristics of the radar return signal
from a swarm of rotor drones. We consider the case of a swarm of identical
drones, with each a number of rotors comprised of a number of rotor blades. By
considering the orientation and speed of each rotor as stochastic variables, we
derive expressions for the autocorrelation function (ACF) and power spectral
density (PSD). The ACF and PSD are in the form of an infinite series with
coefficients that drop to zero at a predictable limit. Thus in practical
applications, the series may be truncated. As a special case, we show that for
deterministic rotor speed, the ACF can be expressed in closed form. We further
investigate how system parameters (Blade length, Rotor speed, number of blades,
and number of drones) influence the derived expressions for the ACF and PSD.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for integrated sensing, computing,
and semantic communication (ISCSC) within vehicular networks comprising a
roadside unit (RSU) and multiple autonomous vehicles. Both the RSU and the
vehicles are equipped with local knowledge bases to facilitate semantic
communication. The framework incorporates a secure communication design to
ensure that messages intended for specific vehicles are protected against
interception. In this model, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed by the
RSU to accurately track all vehicles. We formulate a joint optimization problem
that balances maximizing the probabilistically constrained semantic secrecy
rate for each vehicle while minimizing the sum of the posterior Cram\'er-Rao
bound (PCRB), subject to the RSU's computing capabilities. This non-convex
optimization problem is addressed using Bernstein-type inequality (BTI) and
alternating optimization (AO) techniques. Simulation results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating its advantages in
reliable sensing, high data throughput, and secure communication.

scenarios, the BS must perform joint activity detection and channel estimation
(JADCE) prior to data reception. Message passing algorithms have emerged as a
prominent solution for JADCE under a Bayesian inference framework. The existing
message passing algorithms, however, typically rely on some hand-crafted and
overly simplistic priors of the wireless channel, leading to significant
channel estimation errors and reduced activity detection accuracy. In this
paper, we focus on the problem of JADCE in a multiple-input multiple-output
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) grant-free random access
network. We propose to incorporate a more accurate channel prior learned by
score-based generative models into message passing, so as to push towards the
performance limit of JADCE. Specifically, we develop a novel turbo message
passing (TMP) framework that models the entire channel matrix as a super node,
rather than factorizing it element-wise. This design enables the seamless
integration of score-based generative models as a minimum mean-squared error
(MMSE) denoiser. The variance of the denoiser, which is essential in message
passing, can also be learned through score-based generative models. Our
approach, termed score-based TMP for JADCE (STMP-JADCE), takes full advantages
of the powerful generative prior and, meanwhile, benefits from the fast
convergence speed of message passing. Numerical simulations show that
STMP-JADCE drastically enhances the activity detection and channel estimation
performance compared to the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms.

Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS) reconfigures wireless links through
pinching beamforming, in which the activated locations of pinching antennas
(PAs) along dielectric waveguides are optimized. This article investigates the
application of PASS in multicast communication systems, where pinching
beamforming is designed to maximize the multicast rate. i) In the
single-waveguide scenario, a closed-form solution for the optimal activated
location is derived under the assumption of a single PA and linearly
distributed users. Based on this, a closed-form expression for the achievable
multicast rate is obtained and proven to be larger than that of conventional
fixed-location antenna systems. For the general multiple-PA case with arbitrary
user distributions, an element-wise alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is
proposed to design the pinching beamformer. ii) In the multiple-waveguide
scenario, an AO-based method is developed to jointly optimize the transmit and
pinching beamformers. Specifically, the transmit beamformer is updated using a
majorization-minimization (MM) framework together with second-order cone
programming (SOCP), while the pinching beamformer is optimized via element-wise
sequential refinement. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that: i)
PASS achieves significantly higher multicast rates than conventional
fixed-location antenna systems, particularly when the number of users and
spatial coverage increase; ii) increasing the number of PAs further improves
the multicast performance of PASS.

Abstract: To meet the stringent requirements of next-generation wireless networks,
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is expected to become massive
and pervasive. Unfortunately, this could pose scalability issues in terms of
complexity, power consumption, cost, and processing latency. Therefore, novel
technologies and design approaches, such as the recently introduced holographic
MIMO paradigm, must be investigated to make future networks sustainable. In
this context, we investigate the concept of a dynamic scattering array (DSA) as
a versatile electromagnetic (EM) structure capable of performing joint
wave-based computing and radiation by moving the processing from the digital
domain to the EM domain. We provide a general, wideband analytical framework
for modeling the DSA, which includes a power matching network and realistic
reconfigurable loads. Then we introduce specific design algorithms, and apply
them to various use cases. We demonstrate that some recent EM processing
structures can be seen as particular cases of our general framework. The
examples presented in the numerical results corroborate the potential of DSAs
to reduce complexity and the number of radiofrequency (RF) chains in
holographic MIMO systems while achieving enhanced EM wave processing and
radiation flexibility for tasks such as beamforming and single- and multi-user
MIMO, also exhibiting superdirectivity capabilities.

Motivation: 解决LEO系统中因多普勒频移和延迟扩展导致传统正交方法失效的问题，寻找更优的定位参考信号设计。

Method: 提出非素数长度的Björck序列构造方法，评估其在多普勒环境下的定位精度，并与Gold序列对比。

Result: Björck序列在多普勒环境下表现优异，但存在依赖多普勒的识别问题，提出了两种缓解策略。

Conclusion: Björck序列适合LEO定位系统，但需通过策略优化以应对多普勒不确定性，并提出了扩展性序列复用方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of Bj\"orck sequences, a class of
constant amplitude zero autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences, as a potential
candidate for the design of positioning reference signals (PRS) in Low Earth
Orbit (LEO)-based positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems. Unlike
legacy systems such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) or
terrestrial networks (TNs), LEO-based systems experience large Doppler shifts
and delay spreads, where traditional orthogonalization methods become
ineffective. Compared to commonly used sequences such as Gold and Zadoff-Chu
(ZC), Bj\"orck sequences offer improved ambiguity function behavior, nearly
ideal autocorrelation, greater resilience to interference, and accurate delay
estimation in high Doppler environments. We further propose a novel sequence
construction method to extend Bj\"orck sequences to non-prime lengths while
minimizing cyclic autocorrelation. Focusing on LEO-based non-terrestrial
network (NTN) localization, we evaluate positioning accuracy under various
interference conditions, comparing the performance of Bj\"orck sequences
against Gold sequences, which are traditionally used for PRS generation. While
Bj\"orck sequences demonstrate strong performance in Doppler-rich environments,
we identify an inherent Doppler-dependent behavior that may lead to sequence
misidentification. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: 1) leveraging
the availability of a coarse Doppler estimate and 2) employing sequence subset
selection to ensure sufficient separation between sequences to account for
maximum Doppler uncertainty. Finally, we present scalable sequence reuse
strategies for large LEO constellations.

Conclusion: 论文提出的APLE-LM算法有效解决了ELAA中多用户定位的难题，为6G网络的定位技术提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) not only effectively enhances system
communication performance but also improves the sensing capabilities of
communication systems, making it one of the key enabling technologies in 6G
wireless networks. This paper investigates the multiuser localization problem
in an uplink Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system, where the base
station (BS) is equipped with an ELAA to receive signals from multiple
single-antenna users. We exploit analog beamforming to reduce the number of
radio frequency (RF) chains. We first develop a comprehensive near-field ELAA
channel model that accounts for the antenna radiation pattern and free space
path loss. Due to the large aperture of the ELAA, the angular resolution of the
array is high, which improves user localization accuracy. However, it also
makes the user localization problem highly non-convex, posing significant
challenges when the number of RF chains is limited. To address this issue, we
use an array partitioning strategy to divide the ELAA channel into multiple
subarray channels and utilize the geometric constraints between user locations
and subarrays for probabilistic modeling. To fully exploit these geometric
constraints, we propose the array partitioning-based location estimation with
limited measurements (APLE-LM) algorithm based on the message passing principle
to achieve multiuser localization. We derive the Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound
(BCRB) as the theoretical performance lower bound for our formulated near-field
multiuser localization problem. Extensive simulations under various parameter
configurations validate the proposed APLE-LM algorithm. The results demonstrate
that APLE-LM achieves superior localization accuracy compared to baseline
algorithms and approaches the BCRB at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Abstract: Training beam design for channel estimation with infinite-resolution and
low-resolution phase shifters (PSs) in hybrid analog-digital milimeter wave
(mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is considered in
this paper. By exploiting the sparsity of mmWave channels, the optimization of
the sensing matrices (corresponding to training beams) is formulated according
to the compressive sensing (CS) theory. Under the condition of
infinite-resolution PSs, we propose relevant algorithms to construct the
sensing matrix, where the theory of convex optimization and the gradient
descent in Riemannian manifold is used to design the digital and analog part,
respectively. Furthermore, a block-wise alternating hybrid analog-digital
algorithm is proposed to tackle the design of training beams with
low-resolution PSs, where the performance degeneration caused by non-convex
constant modulus and discrete phase constraints is effectively compensated to
some extent thanks to the iterations among blocks. Finally, the orthogonal
matching pursuit (OMP) based estimator is adopted for achieving an effective
recovery of the sparse mmWave channel. Simulation results demonstrate the
performance advantages of proposed algorithms compared with some existing
schemes.

Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) are a promising technology to achieve a significant
enhancement in rate for future wireless networks. The pioneering investigation
on near-field directional modulation design for a reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted MA system is presented, with the base station equipped
with a MA array. To maximize the secrecy sum rate (Max-SSR) with hardware
impairments (HWIs) and imperfect channel state information (CSI), which
involves a joint optimization of beamforming vectors for confidential messages
and artificial noise (AN), power allocation factors, phase shift matrices, MA
positions, and receive beamforming vectors. Firstly, the transmit beamforming
vectors and phase shift matrices are iteratively optimized, leveraging leakage
theory and phase alignment techniques. Then, two novel algorithms for discrete
MA positioning are proposed, respectively, employing uniform and compressed
sensing (CS)-based non-uniform grouping strategies. Subsequently, the AN is
considered and designed as the additional energy required for zero-space
projection, and the receive beamforming vector is derived using the minimum
mean square error (MMSE) method. The proposed algorithms have low computational
complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms. Under HWIs and imperfect CSI, the proposed algorithm can achieve a
28\% enhancement in SSR performance while reducing the number of antennas by
37.5\% compared to traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems.

Conclusion: SS-ISAR-Net为稀疏ISAR成像提供了一种高效的自监督学习方案，解决了训练数据不足的问题。

Abstract: Numerous sparse inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging methods based
on unfolded neural networks have been developed for high-quality image
reconstruction with sparse measurements. However, their training typically
requires paired ISAR images and echoes, which are often difficult to obtain.
Meanwhile, one property can be observed that for a certain sparse measurement
configuration of ISAR, when a target is rotated around its center of mass, only
the image of the target undergoes the corresponding rotation after ISAR
imaging, while the grating lobes do not follow this rotation and are solely
determined by the sparse-sampling pattern. This property is mathematically
termed as the equivariant property. Taking advantage of this property, an
unfolded neural network for sparse ISAR imaging with self-supervised learning,
named SS-ISAR-Net is proposed. It effectively mitigates grating lobes caused by
sparse radar echo, allowing high-quality training to be achieved using only
sparse radar echo data. The superiority of the proposed SS-ISAR-Net, compared
to existing methods, is verified through experiments with both synthetic and
real-world measurement data.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider uplink channel estimation for massive multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems with partially connected hybrid beamforming
(PC-HBF) structures. Existing beam design and channel estimation schemes are
usually based on ideal assumptions and require transmitting pilots across
multiple timeslots, making them unsuitable for practical PC-HBF systems. To
overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel beam design and a corresponding
channel estimation algorithm to achieve accurate and real-time uplink channel
estimation. Firstly, we introduce a group-wise narrow beam design in the
vertical dimension to suppress interference from undesired angular components
and improve vertical angle estimation accuracy,which divides the columns of the
uniform planar array (UPA)into groups and the vertical angle interval into
sub-intervals.In this way, each group is assigned with a narrow beam to cover
one vertical angle sub-interval, and the set of narrow beams is designed based
on the filter design theory. Secondly, we optimize the antenna grouping pattern
using the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA), balancing interference
suppression and resolution capability in the horizontal dimension, leading to a
better horizontal angle estimation performance. Finally, we design a
low-complexity group-wise subspace constrained variational Bayesian inference
(GW-SC-VBI) algorithm to fully take advantage of the proposed beam design to
achieve both low-complexity and high-accurate channel estimation. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves notable performance gains
over baseline methods.

Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) is a key enabler
for the sixth generation (6G) networks, offering unprecedented spectral
efficiency and ubiquitous coverage. In CF-mMIMO systems, the association of
user equipments (UEs) to access points (APs) is a critical challenge, as it
directly impacts network scalability, interference management, and overall
system performance. Conventional association methods primarily focus on
optimizing communication performance. However, with the emergence of sensing
and joint communication and sensing (JCAS) requirements, conventional
approaches become insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose a
scalable user association (SUA) scheme for CF-mMIMO networks, considering
heterogeneous UE requirements. Designed to enhance the performance of both
sensing and communication, the proposed SUA scheme aims to ensure network
scalability. This is achieved by dynamically assigning APs to UEs based on
their specific service requirements (communication, sensing, or JCAS), while
considering link quality, interference mitigation, and network-related
constraints. Specifically, the proposed SUA scheme employs AP masking, link
prioritization, and an optimization-based association mechanism to select the
most suitable APs for each UE. Simulations show that, compared to conventional
CF-mMIMO methods, the proposed SUA scheme significantly reduces interference
and computational runtime, while improving the symbol error rate for
communication and the probability of detection for sensing.

Result: Wasserstein DRO框架能够统一经典范数约束和椭球鲁棒波束成形模型，提供更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Wasserstein DRO为鲁棒波束成形提供了统一框架，弥合了确定性和分布鲁棒方法之间的差距。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based robust adaptive beamforming
(RAB) enables enhanced robustness against model uncertainties, such as steering
vector mismatches and interference-plus-noise covariance matrix estimation
errors. Existing DRO-based RAB methods primarily rely on uncertainty sets
characterized by the first- and second-order moments. In this work, we propose
a novel Wasserstein DRO-based beamformer, using the worst-case
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization formulation. The proposed
method leverages the Wasserstein metric to define uncertainty sets, offering a
data-driven characterization of uncertainty. We show that the choice of the
Wasserstein cost function plays a crucial role in shaping the resulting
formulation, with norm-based and Mahalanobis-like quadratic costs recovering
classical norm-constrained and ellipsoidal robust beamforming models,
respectively. This insight highlights the Wasserstein DRO framework as a
unifying approach, bridging deterministic and distributionally robust
beamforming methodologies.

Abstract: The use of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites in the next generation (Next-G)
communication systems has been gaining traction over the last few years due to
their potential for providing global connectivity with low latency. Since they
are the closest to the earth they come with their own set of disadvantages
including high vulnerability to jamming and interference. To address these
issues, this paper introduces a resilient, self-healing network designed to
optimize signal quality under dynamic interference and adversarial conditions.
The network leverages inter-satellite communication and an intelligent
algorithm selection process, incorporating combining techniques like
distributed-Maximal Ratio Combining (d-MRC), distributed-Linear Minimum Mean
Squared Error Estimation (d-LMMSE), and Selection Combining (SC). These
algorithms are selected to improve performance by adapting to changing network
conditions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we develop
a software-defined radio (SDR)-based hardware testbed and perform detailed
performance evaluations. Additionally, we present results from field tests
conducted on the AERPAW testbed, which validate the proposed combining
solutions in real-world scenarios. The results show that our approach makes LEO
satellite networks more reliable and better able to handle interference, making
them suitable for critical communications.

Abstract: Non-terrestrial network (NTN)-based integrated communication and computation
empowers various emerging applications with global coverage. Yet this vision is
severely challenged by the energy issue given the limited energy supply of NTN
nodes and the energy-consuming nature of communication and computation. In this
paper, we investigate the energy-efficient integrated communication and
computation for the ground node data through a NTN, incorporating an unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) and a satellite. We jointly consider ground data
offloading to the UAV, edge processing on the UAV, and the forwarding of
results from UAV to satellite, where we particularly address the uncertainties
of the UAV-satellite links due to the large distance and high dynamics therein.
Accordingly, we propose to minimize the weighted energy consumption due to data
offloading, UAV computation, UAV transmission, and UAV propulsion, in the
presence of angular uncertainties under Gaussian distribution within the
UAV-satellite channels. The formulated problem with probabilistic constraints
due to uncertainties is converted into a deterministic form by exploiting the
Bernstein-type inequality, which is then solved using a block coordinate
descent framework with algorithm design. Simulation results are provided to
demonstrate the performance superiority of our proposal in terms of energy
sustainability, along with the robustness against uncertain non-terrestrial
environments.

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution
for evolving wireless receivers from the classical to the quantum domain. To
further unleash their great potential in wireless communications, we propose a
flexible architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum multiple-input multiple-output
(RAQ-MIMO) receivers in the multi-user uplink. Then the corresponding signal
model of the RAQ-MIMO system is constructed by paving the way from quantum
physics to classical wireless communications. Explicitly, we outline the
associated operating principles and transmission flow. We also validate the
linearity of our model and its feasible region. Based on our model, we derive
closed-form asymptotic formulas for the ergodic achievable rate (EAR) of both
the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers operating in
uncorrelated fading channels (UFC) and the correlated fading channels (CFC),
respectively. Furthermore, we theoretically characterize the EAR difference
both between the UFC and CFC scenarios, as well as MRC and ZF schemes. More
particularly, we quantify the superiority of RAQ-MIMO receivers over the
classical massive MIMO (M-MIMO) receivers, specifying an increase of $\log_{2}
\Pi$ of the EAR per user, $\Pi$-fold reduction of the users' transmit power,
and $\sqrt[\nu]{\Pi}$-fold increase of the transmission distance, respectively,
where $\Pi = \text{ReceiverGainRatio} / \text{ReceiverNoisePowerRatio}$ of the
single-sensor receivers and $\nu$ is the path-loss exponent. Our simulation
results reveal that, compared to classical M-MIMO receivers, our RAQ-MIMO
scheme can either realize $\sim 12$ bits/s/Hz/user ($\sim 8$ bits/s/Hz/user)
higher EAR, or $\sim 10000$-fold ($\sim 500$-fold) lower transmit power, or
alternatively, $\sim 100$-fold ($\sim 21$-fold) longer distance in free-space
transmissions, in the standard quantum limit (photon shot limit).

face significant challenges in spectrum management, interference mitigation,
and real-time coordination across dynamic and resource-constrained

validation and standardization. We highlight how federated and reinforcement
learning techniques support decentralized, adaptive decision-making under
mobility and energy constraints. In addition, we discuss the role of real-world
platforms such as AERPAW in bridging the gap between simulation and deployment
and enabling iterative system refinement under realistic conditions. This study
aims to provide a forward-looking roadmap toward developing efficient and

Abstract: In this paper, we propose scalable distributed beamforming schemes over low
Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks that rely solely on statistical channel
state information for downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
systems. We begin by introducing the system model and presenting a pragmatic
yet effective analog beamformer and user-scheduling design. We then derive a
closed-form lower bound on the ergodic sum rate, based on the hardening bound,
for the digital beamformer design. Next, we formulate a per-satellite
power-constrained sum-rate maximization problem, whose centralized solution,
obtained via the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) framework,
establishes performance limits and motivates decentralized strategies. We
subsequently introduce two decentralized optimization schemes, based on
approximating the hardening bound and decentralizing the WMMSE framework, for
representative inter-satellite link topologies. In the Ring scheme, satellites
update beamformers locally and exchange intermediate parameters sequentially.
In the Star scheme, edge satellites update beamformers locally and in parallel,
achieving consensus on intermediate parameters at a central satellite using a
penalty-dual decomposition framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate that
our distributed designs achieve near-centralized performance with superior
scalability, substantially outperforming simple closed-form beamformers and
single-satellite baselines in sum rate. Additionally, the delay-overhead
trade-off between the two topologies is revealed.

Result: 算法能有效分配功率，解决干扰问题，并平衡异构用户需求的支持。

Conclusion: 该算法为6G异构系统提供了一种有效的功率分配方案，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Water-filling (WF) algorithms are pivotal in maximizing capacity and spectral
efficiency in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However,
traditional WF approaches cater solely to communication requirements,
neglecting the emerging heterogeneity of 6G, including sensing and joint
radar-communication (JRC). As these diverse demands grow in importance and have
different Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, traditional WF becomes
inadequate. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a unified interference-aware
and QoS-constrained WF algorithm for systems with communication, sensing, and
JRC. The proposed algorithm enables power allocation for multi-user MIMO
systems, effectively addressing interference and balancing the support for
heterogeneous user requirements.

Abstract: An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based communication typically involves a
link between a UAV-mounted antenna and a ground station. The radiation pattern
of both antennas is influenced by nearby reflecting surfaces and scatterers,
such as the UAV body and the ground. Experimentally characterizing the
effective radiation patterns of both antennas is challenging, as the received
power depends on their interaction. In this study, we learn a combined
radiation pattern from experimental UAV flight data, assuming the UAV travels
with a fixed orientation (constant yaw angle and zero pitch/roll). We validate
the characterized radiation pattern by cross-referencing it with experiments
involving different UAV trajectories, all conducted under identical ground
station and UAV orientation conditions. Experimental results show that the
learned combined radiation pattern reduces received power estimation error by
up to 10 dB, compared to traditional anechoic chamber radiation patterns that
neglect the effects of the UAV body and surrounding objects.

Conclusion: 该方案成功提升了真实信号的保密性能，同时确保了虚假信号的欺骗效果。

Abstract: In wireless communication adversarial scenarios, signals are easily
intercepted by non-cooperative parties, exposing the transmission of
confidential information. This paper proposes a true-and-false (T/F) frequency
multiplexing based anti-intercepting transmission scheme capable of concealing
truth while showing fake (CTSF), integrating both offensive and defensive
strategies. Specifically, through multi-source cooperation, true and false
signals are transmitted over multiple frequency bands using non-orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing. The decoy signals are used to deceive
non-cooperative eavesdropper, while the true signals are hidden to counter
interception threats. Definitions for the interception and deception
probabilities are provided, and the mechanism of CTSF is discussed. To improve
the secrecy performance of true signals while ensuring decoy signals achieve
their deceptive purpose, we model the problem as maximizing the sum secrecy
rate of true signals, with constraint on the decoy effect. Furthermore, we
propose a bi-stage alternating dual-domain optimization approach for joint
optimization of both power allocation and correlation coefficients among
multiple sources, and a Newton's method is proposed for fitting the T/F
frequency multiplexing factor. In addition, simulation results verify the
efficiency of anti-intercepting performance of our proposed CTSF scheme.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a class of bio -inspired
networks that leverage sparse, event-driven signaling to achieve low-power
computation while inherently modeling temporal dynamics. Such characteristics
align closely with the demands of ubiquitous computing systems, which often
operate on resource-constrained devices while continuously monitoring and

features, SNNs have received limited attention and remain underexplored (or at
least, under-adopted) within the ubiquitous computing community. To address
this gap, this paper first introduces the core components of SNNs, both in
terms of models and training mechanisms. It then presents a systematic survey
of 76 SNN-based studies focused on time-series data analysis, categorizing them
into six key application domains. For each domain, we summarize relevant works
and subsequent advancements, distill core insights, and highlight key takeaways
for researchers and practitioners. To facilitate hands-on experimentation, we
also provide a comprehensive review of current software frameworks and
neuromorphic hardware platforms, detailing their capabilities and
specifications, and then offering tailored recommendations for selecting
development tools based on specific application needs. Finally, we identify
prevailing challenges within each application domain and propose future
research directions that need be explored in ubiquitous community. Our survey
highlights the transformative potential of SNNs in enabling energy-efficient
ubiquitous sensing across diverse application domains, while also serving as an
essential introduction for researchers looking to enter this emerging field.

Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools
for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across
diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability
of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph
structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and
deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we
study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a
novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that
focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation
characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This
way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on
the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and
perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to
validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing
baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on
downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the
proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data
distribution into stability analysis.

Abstract: Signed graphs are equipped with both positive and negative edge weights,
encoding pairwise correlations as well as anti-correlations in data. A balanced
signed graph is a signed graph with no cycles containing an odd number of
negative edges. Laplacian of a balanced signed graph has eigenvectors that map
via a simple linear transform to ones in a corresponding positive graph
Laplacian, thus enabling reuse of spectral filtering tools designed for
positive graphs. We propose an efficient method to learn a balanced signed
graph Laplacian directly from data. Specifically, extending a previous linear
programming (LP) based sparse inverse covariance estimation method called
CLIME, we formulate a new LP problem for each Laplacian column $i$, where the
linear constraints restrict weight signs of edges stemming from node $i$, so
that nodes of same / different polarities are connected by positive / negative
edges. Towards optimal model selection, we derive a suitable CLIME parameter
$\rho$ based on a combination of the Hannan-Quinn information criterion and a
minimum feasibility criterion. We solve the LP problem efficiently by tailoring
a sparse LP method based on ADMM. We theoretically prove local solution
convergence of our proposed iterative algorithm. Extensive experimental results
on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our balanced graph learning
method outperforms competing methods and enables reuse of spectral filters,
wavelets, and graph convolutional nets (GCN) constructed for positive graphs.

Abstract: The URGENT 2024 Challenge aims to foster speech enhancement (SE) techniques
with great universality, robustness, and generalizability, featuring a broader
task definition, large-scale multi-domain data, and comprehensive evaluation

analysis of two key, yet understudied, issues in SE system development: data
cleaning and evaluation metrics. We highlight several overlooked problems in
traditional SE pipelines: (1) mismatches between declared and effective audio
bandwidths, along with label noise even in various "high-quality" speech
corpora; (2) lack of both effective SE systems to conquer the hardest
conditions (e.g., speech overlap, strong noise / reverberation) and reliable
measure of speech sample difficulty; (3) importance of combining multifaceted
metrics for a comprehensive evaluation correlating well with human judgment. We
hope that this endeavor can inspire improved SE pipeline designs in the future.

Abstract: Decoding continuous language from neural signals remains a significant
challenge in the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We
introduce Neuro2Semantic, a novel framework that reconstructs the semantic
content of perceived speech from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Our
approach consists of two phases: first, an LSTM-based adapter aligns neural
signals with pre-trained text embeddings; second, a corrector module generates
continuous, natural text directly from these aligned embeddings. This flexible
method overcomes the limitations of previous decoding approaches and enables
unconstrained text generation. Neuro2Semantic achieves strong performance with
as little as 30 minutes of neural data, outperforming a recent state-of-the-art
method in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential for
practical applications in brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding
technologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种支持多样化任务和灵活心电图（ECG）输入的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）anyECG-chat，并构建了anyECG数据集以填补现有数据的单调性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ECG的MLLM主要局限于单导联、短时程的ECG报告生成，未能充分发挥MLLM的潜力，因此需要开发支持更广泛任务和灵活输入的模型。

Method: 构建了anyECG数据集，包含多种任务和ECG类型；提出anyECG-chat模型，支持动态长度和多ECG输入，采用三阶段课程训练方法。

Result: anyECG-chat能够支持多种实际应用场景，包括家庭环境中的长时程少导联ECG异常波形定位和多ECG综合分析。

Conclusion: anyECG-chat通过灵活的数据集和模型设计，成功扩展了MLLM在ECG分析中的应用范围。

Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest
in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing
ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to
single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the
potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that
supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However,
existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first
constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks,
including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended
question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced
long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG
comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we
propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and
multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum
training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was
conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various
practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation
tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead
ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple
ECGs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征融合和知识蒸馏的多模态多目标检测分类框架，显著提升精度并减少推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多源异构数据输入和资源受限设备上AI模型计算复杂度高的挑战。

Method: 结合RGB和热成像输入的多模态融合模型，采用知识蒸馏训练管道，通过复合损失函数优化后验概率。

Result: 学生模型达到教师模型95%的精度，推理时间减少50%。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于实际多目标检测分类部署场景。

Abstract: In the surveillance and defense domain, multi-target detection and
classification (MTD) is considered essential yet challenging due to
heterogeneous inputs from diverse data sources and the computational complexity
of algorithms designed for resource-constrained embedded devices, particularly
for Al-based solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a feature
fusion and knowledge-distilled framework for multi-modal MTD that leverages
data fusion to enhance accuracy and employs knowledge distillation for improved
domain adaptation. Specifically, our approach utilizes both RGB and thermal
image inputs within a novel fusion-based multi-modal model, coupled with a
distillation training pipeline. We formulate the problem as a posterior
probability optimization task, which is solved through a multi-stage training
pipeline supported by a composite loss function. This loss function effectively
transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our student model achieves approximately 95% of the
teacher model's mean Average Precision while reducing inference time by
approximately 50%, underscoring its suitability for practical MTD deployment
scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于HuBERT框架的自监督BCI预训练方法，适用于EEG数据，展示了其在标准BCI任务及个体差异特征学习中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何利用自监督预训练方法学习脑电图的鲁棒表征，以解决神经解码中的长期挑战，同时扩展AI方法在神经数据中的应用范围。

Method: 采用基于HuBERT的Transformer框架，使用8通道EEG数据进行低负荷实时处理，实现自监督预训练。

Result: 模型不仅支持标准BCI任务（如P300、运动想象），还能学习个体差异和显著电生理特征（如α节律）。

Conclusion: 该方法为BCI模型预训练和神经解码提供了新思路，并拓宽了AI在神经数据中的潜在应用场景。

Abstract: Brain computer interface (BCI) research, as well as increasing portions of
the field of neuroscience, have found success deploying large-scale artificial
intelligence (AI) pre-training methods in conjunction with vast public
repositories of data. This approach of pre-training foundation models using
label-free, self-supervised objectives offers the potential to learn robust
representations of neurophysiology, potentially addressing longstanding
challenges in neural decoding. However, to date, much of this work has focused
explicitly on standard BCI benchmarks and tasks, which likely overlooks the
multitude of features these powerful methods might learn about brain function
as well as other electrophysiological information. We introduce a new method
for self-supervised BCI foundation model pre-training for EEG inspired by a
transformer-based approach adapted from the HuBERT framework originally
developed for speech processing. Our pipeline is specifically focused on
low-profile, real-time usage, involving minimally pre-processed data and just
eight EEG channels on the scalp. We show that our foundation model learned a
representation of EEG that supports standard BCI tasks (P300, motor imagery),
but also that this model learns features of neural data related to individual
variability, and other salient electrophysiological components (e.g., alpha
rhythms). In addition to describing and evaluating a novel approach to
pre-training BCI models and neural decoding, this work opens the aperture for
what kind of tasks and use-cases might exist for neural data in concert with
powerful AI methods.

Result: 框架在AP数量增加时有效扩展，通过MSE、SER和BER评估表明其性能优于现有有线前传网络。

Conclusion: 空中计算框架在资源效率和性能上优于传统方法，适用于大规模MIMO网络。

Abstract: We propose a novel resource-efficient over-the-air(OTA) computation framework
to address the huge fronthaul computational and control overhead requirements
in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. We show
that the global sufficient statistics to decode the data symbols can be
computed OTA using the locally available information at the access points
(APs). We provide the essential signal processing aspects at the APs and the
central processing unit (CPU) to facilitate the OTA computation of sufficient
statistics. The proposed framework scales effectively with an increase in the
number of APs. We also make a comprehensive study of the benefits of an OTA
framework compared to a conventional digital fronthaul in terms of the overhead
associated in transferring the sufficient statistics from the APs to the CPU.
To evaluate the performance of the OTA framework, we give closed-form
expressions for the mean-square error (MSE)of the estimators of sufficient
statistics and the overall data estimator. Furthermore, we assess the symbol
error rate (SER)and bit error rate (BER) of the user equipment (UEs) data to
demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and benchmark them against the
state-of-the-art wired fronthaul networks.

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC), one of the emerging techniques in the field of
communication, is entering a new phase following several decades of
foundational research. Recently, attention has shifted toward MC in liquid
media, particularly within tubular environments, due to novel application
scenarios. The spatial constraints of such environments make accurate modeling
of molecular movement in tubes more challenging than in traditional free-space
channels. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional channel model for
molecular communications with an absorbing ring-shaped receiver in a tubular
environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study
to model the impact of an absorbing ring-shaped receiver on the channel
response in tube-based MC systems. The problem is formulated as a partial
differential equation with heterogeneous boundary conditions, and an
approximate solution is derived under flow-dominated conditions. The accuracy
of the proposed model is validated through particle-based simulations. We
anticipate that the results of this study will contribute to the design of
practical MC systems in real-world tubular environments.

Conclusion: 本文不仅提出了实用的短长度编码方案，还提供了理论框架，有助于优化和比较不同参数下的DHT方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the design of practical shortlength coding schemes for
Distributed Hypothesis Testing (DHT). While most prior work on DHT has focused
on informationtheoretic analyses, deriving bounds on Type-II error exponents
via achievability schemes based on quantization and quantizebinning, the
practical implementation of DHT coding schemes has remained largely unexplored.
Moreover, existing practical coding solutions for quantization and
quantize-binning approaches were developed for source reconstruction tasks
considering very long code length, and they are not directly applicable to DHT.
In this context, this paper introduces efficient shortlength implementations of
quantization and quantize-binning schemes for DHT, constructed from short
binary linear block codes. Numerical results show the efficiency of the
proposed coding schemes compared to uncoded cases and to existing schemes
initially developed for data reconstruction. In addition to practical code
design, the paper derives exact analytical expressions for the Type-I and
Type-II error probabilities associated with each proposed scheme. The provided
analytical expressions are shown to predict accurately the practical
performance measured from Monte-Carlo simulations of the proposed schemes.
These theoretical results are novel and offer a useful framework for optimizing
and comparing practical DHT schemes across a wide range of source and code
parameters.

Abstract: Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the
amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative
audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal
envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for
sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in
psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to
produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct
temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal
structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we
introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual
guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through
human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these
principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually
intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that
guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised
framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress
temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks
for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic
data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing
temporally intermediate morphs. All code, models, and datasets will be made
publicly available upon publication.
