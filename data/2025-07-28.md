### [1] [Design and Implementation of Parametrized Look-Up Tables for Post-Correction of Oversampling Low-Resolution ADCs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18673)
*Morriel Kasher,Michael Tinston,Predrag Spasojevic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于设计和优化查找表（LUT）的框架，以提高量化信号的信噪比和频谱纯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决量化信号中的噪声和频谱不纯问题，尤其是对于低分辨率宽带设备。

Method: 将LUT设计问题分解为四个阶段，采用模型驱动方法，无需训练，并研究了三种抖动方法和两种新的索引方案。

Result: LUT设计将SFDR提高了19 dBc，内存占用减少四个数量级，仅需324字节，并保持3位固定点精度。

Conclusion: 该框架为低分辨率宽带设备提供了高性能、低延迟的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a framework for the design, optimization, and implementation of
Look-Up Tables (LUTs) used to recover noisy, oversampled, quantized signals
given a parametric input model. The LUTs emulate the spectral effects of
pre-quantization dithering through an all-digital solution applied after
quantization. This methodology decomposes the intractable LUT design problem
into four distinct stages, each of which is addressed analytically using a
model-driven approach without reliance on training. Three dithering methods are
studied to improve spectral purity metrics. Two novel indexing schemes are
proposed to limit the LUT memory overhead shown to compress the LUT size by
over four orders of magnitude with marginal performance loss. The LUT design is
tested with an oversampled noisy sinusoidal input quantized to 3 bits and shown
to improve its Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) by over 19 dBc with only 324
bytes of memory while maintaining the same 3-bit fixed-point precision at the
digital output. This correction can be implemented using two-level
combinational logic ensuring ultra-low latency and, hence, suitable for
low-resolution wideband devices.

*Yufeng Zhou,Wen Chen,Qingqing Wu,Xusheng Zhu,Zhendong Li,Kunlun Wang,Qiong Wu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了可移动天线(MA)辅助的下行非正交多址(NOMA)网络，以最大化系统吞吐量。通过联合优化基站波束成形、功率分配和MA位置，提出了一种基于交替优化(AO)的高效算法，并验证了其性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了充分利用可移动天线在通信网络中的自由度，提升非正交多址(NOMA)网络的吞吐量，研究基站和用户端MA的联合优化问题具有重要价值。

Method: 采用交替优化(AO)框架，将原问题分解为三个子问题，并利用SPCA和SCA技术处理非凸约束，确保算法收敛到局部最优解。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提出的系统在吞吐量上显著优于基准方案，证明了MA自由度的有效利用。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化MA位置和通信参数，显著提升了系统性能，为未来MA辅助的通信网络设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the movable antenna (MA)- assisted downlink
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network to maximize system throughput. In
the considered scenario, both the base station (BS) and users are equipped with
MA, and a predetermined successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding
order is adopted. Based on the field-response channel model, we formulate a
complex, non-convex problem to jointly optimize the BS beamforming, power
allocation, and MA positions at both the transmitter and receivers. To address
this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization
(AO) framework, which decomposes the original problem into three distinct
subproblems. By employing sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) and
successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, the non-convex constraints
within each subproblem are transformed into tractable. This methodology ensures
the algorithm converges to a stable, locally optimal solution. Numerical
results validate that the proposed system, which fully exploits the degrees of
freedom from antenna mobility at both ends, significantly outperforms
benchmarks in terms of throughput.

### [3] [Max-Min Rate Optimization for Multigroup Multicast MISO Systems Via Novel Transmissive RIS Transceiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18733)
*Yuan Guo,Wen Chen,Qingqing Wu,Yanze Zhu,Yang Liu,Zhendong Li,Ying Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了一种基于透射式可重构智能表面(RIS)收发器架构的多组多播下行通信系统，通过优化算法解决最大最小速率问题，提出了三种算法并验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多组多播系统中用户速率不均和计算复杂度高的问题，提升通信质量。

Method: 结合SCA、罚函数法、WMMSE框架、平滑近似理论和MM方法，提出了三种优化算法。

Result: SOCP方法性能最优，低复杂度算法在性能略降的情况下显著降低计算量。

Conclusion: 算法有效性和复杂度得到验证，SOCP方法在性能和复杂度上表现最佳，适合实际应用。

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS) transceiver architectureenabled multigroup multicast downlink
communication system. Under this setup, an optimization problem is formulated
to maximize the minimum rate of users across all groups, subject to the maximum
available power of each RIS unit. Due to the nondifferentiable nature of the
objective function, the max-min rate problem is challenging to solve. To tackle
this difficult problem, we develop an iterative solution by leveraging the
successive convex approximation (SCA) and the penalty function method. However,
the above approach has high computational complexity and may lead to
compromised performance. To overcome these drawbacks, we design an efficient
second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based method using the weighted minimum
mean squared error (WMMSE) framework to reduce computational complexity.
Furthermore, to further reduce the computational complexity, we also propose a
low-complexity and solver-free algorithm that analytically updates all
variables by combining the smooth approximation theory and the
majorization-minimization (MM) method. Numerical results are provided to verify
the convergence and effectiveness of our proposed three algorithms. It is also
demonstrated that the SOCP-based method outperforms the penalty-based algorithm
in terms of both the achieved min rate and the computational complexity. In
contrast, the lowcomplexity design achieves significantly lower complexity with
only slightly degraded performance.

### [4] [Max-Min Fairness-Oriented Beamforming Design in HAPS-Enabled ISAC for 6G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18764)

Conclusion: HAPS-ISAC系统是6G网络和集成通信-感知系统的关键推动者。

Abstract: This paper presents a high-altitude platform station (HAPS)-enabled
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system designed for
sixth-generation (6G) networks. Positioned in the stratosphere, HAPS serves as
a super-macro base station, leveraging advanced beamforming techniques to
enable communication and sensing simultaneously. This research addresses the
need for equitable service distribution in 6G networks by focusing on fairness
within the HAPS-ISAC system. It tackles a non-convex optimization problem that
balances sensing beampattern gain and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) requirements among communication users (CUs) using a max-min fairness
approach while adhering to power constraints. The proposed HAPS-ISAC framework
ensures efficient resource allocation, reliable coverage, and improved sensing
accuracy. Simulation results validate the potential of HAPS-ISAC as a pivotal
enabler for 6G networks and integrated communication-sensing systems.

*Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe,Jiancheng An,Iván Alexander Morales Sandoval,Hyeon Seok Rou,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu,Chau Yuen,Mérouane Debbah*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的双色散（DD）MIMO信道模型，结合柔性智能超表面（FIM），适用于高移动性场景中的综合感知与通信（ISAC）。通过优化模型，显著提升了多种波形的可实现速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高移动性场景中，综合感知与通信（ISAC）的需求日益增长，现有的信道模型可能无法充分应对双色散（DD）环境下的挑战，因此需要引入柔性智能超表面（FIM）来优化信道性能。

Method: 提出了一种FIM参数化的双色散（FPDD）信道模型，并将其应用于OFDM、OTFS和AFDM等波形。通过梯度上升算法解决可实现速率最大化问题，并提供了闭式梯度公式。

Result: 数值结果表明，通过精心参数化的FIM技术，可以显著提升所有适用于DD信道缓解的波形的ISAC性能，实现更高的通信速率。

Conclusion: 该研究为高移动性场景中的ISAC提供了一种有效的信道模型优化方法，展示了FIM技术在提升通信性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel doubly-dispersive (DD) multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) channel model incorporating flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs),
which is suitable for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in
high-mobility scenarios. We then discuss how the proposed FIM-parameterized DD
(FPDD) channel model can be applied in a logical manner to ISAC waveforms that
are known to perform well in DD environments, namely, orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and
affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Leveraging the proposed model,
we formulate an achievable rate maximization problem with a strong sensing
constraint for all the aforementioned waveforms, which we then solve via a
gradient ascent algorithm with closed-form gradients presented as a bonus. Our
numerical results indicate that the achievable rate is significantly impacted
by the emerging FIM technology with careful parametrization essential in
obtaining strong ISAC performance across all waveforms suitable to mitigating
the effects of DD channels.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising
technology to enhance indoor wireless communication and sensing performance.
However, the construction of reliable received signal strength (RSS)-based
fingerprint databases for RIS-assisted indoor positioning remains an open
challenge due to the lack of realistic and spatially consistent channel
modeling methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method with open-source
codes for generating RIS-assisted RSS fingerprint databases. Our method
captures the complex RIS-assisted multipath behaviors by extended cluster-based
channel modeling and the physical and electromagnetic properties of RIS and
transmitter (Tx). And the spatial consistency is incorporated when simulating
the fingerprint data collection across neighboring positions. Furthermore, the
proposed method offers exceptional flexibility in configuring RIS and Tx
parameters. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the fingerprint
database generated by the proposed method. Moreover, the positioning
performance on the database using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and deep neural
network (DNN) is analyzed, providing valuable insights for the system design.

### [7] [Assessing the Reliability and Validity of a Balance Mat for Measuring Postural Stability: A Combined Robot-Human Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18943)
*Abishek Shrestha,Damith Herath,Angie Fearon,Maryam Ghahramani*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究评估了一种新型平衡垫（BM）的可靠性和有效性，表明其在经过校准后可以作为传统力板（FP）的便携替代品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 力板（FP）虽然被视为实验室条件下评估姿势摇摆的金标准，但其便携性差且需要高专业知识，限制了广泛使用。因此，研究推出了一种基于光纤技术的低成本便携平衡垫（BM）。

Method: 研究分为两部分：机器人研究和人类研究。机器人研究中用UR10机械臂生成可控摇摆模式以评估BM的可靠性和敏感性；人类研究中，51名健康年轻参与者在BM和FP上完成平衡任务，比较两者的摇摆指标。

Result: 机器人研究显示BM的可靠性良好至优秀；人类研究表明BM在摇摆路径和范围上与FP有中度到强相关性，但存在比例偏差，BM高估了摇摆指标。通过校准改善了设备间的一致性。

Conclusion: BM在多种姿势条件下表现出稳定的测量能力，校准后具有良好的可靠性和有效性，适合作为FP的替代方案。

Abstract: Postural sway assessment is important for detecting balance problems and
identifying people at risk of falls. Force plates (FP) are considered the gold
standard postural sway assessment method in laboratory conditions, but their
lack of portability and requirement of high-level expertise limit their
widespread usage. This study evaluates the reliability and validity of a novel
Balance Mat (BM) device, a low-cost portable alternative that uses optical
fibre technology. The research includes two studies: a robot study and a human
study. In the robot study, a UR10 robotic arm was used to obtain controlled
sway patterns to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the BM. In the human
study, 51 healthy young participants performed balance tasks on the BM in
combination with an FP to evaluate the BM's validity. Sway metrics such as sway
mean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range,
and sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared. Reliability
was evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), where values
greater than 0.9 were considered excellent and values between 0.75 and 0.9 were
considered good. Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent
ICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed
moderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman
plots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the
FP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP. Calibration was
used to improve the agreement between the devices. The device demonstrated
consistent sway measurement across varied stance conditions, establishing both
reliability and validity following appropriate calibration.

### [8] [Max-Min Beamforming for Large-Scale Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Randomized ADMM Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18980)
*Bin Wang,Jun Fang,Yue Xiao,Martin Haardt*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机ADMM算法的大规模MMB问题解决方案，显著降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMB方法计算效率低，难以应对大规模问题。

Method: 通过将可行性检查问题转化为线性约束优化问题，设计随机ADMM算法，每次迭代仅需解决少量子问题。

Result: 算法具有与确定性方法相同的收敛速度O(1/\bar{t})，且计算复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: 该算法在解决MMB问题时具有显著的计算优势。

Abstract: We consider the problem of max-min beamforming (MMB) for cell-free massive
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, where the objective is to maximize the
minimum achievable rate among all users. Existing MMB methods are mainly based
on deterministic optimization methods, which are computationally inefficient
when the problem size grows large. To address this issue, we, in this paper,
propose a randomized alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM)
algorithm for large-scale MMB problems. We first propose a novel formulation
that transforms the highly challenging feasibility-checking problem into a
linearly constrained optimization problem. An efficient randomized ADMM is then
developed for solving the linearly constrained problem. Unlike standard ADMM,
randomized ADMM only needs to solve a small number of subproblems at each
iteration to ensure convergence, thus achieving a substantial complexity
reduction. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm
exhibits an O(1/\bar{t}) convergence rate (\bar{t} represents the number of
iterations), which is on the same order as its deterministic counterpart.
Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm offers a significant
complexity advantage over existing methods in solving the MMB problem.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的创新方法，用于光学无线通信中的无线地图估计，取代传统仿真技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仿真技术耗时且需要大量样本，难以满足实时需求，因此提出基于机器学习的方法。

Method: 使用多层感知机（MLP）建模室内可见光通信（VLC）系统，通过调整MLP参数（如样本量、训练轮次和批次大小）优化性能。

Result: 该方法提供快速、准确的仿真和性能预测，训练样本需求较少，适合实时估计。

Conclusion: 通过优化MLP参数，可在推理精度和训练时间之间取得平衡，满足实时需求。

Abstract: An innovative method for radio map estimation in optical wireless
communications is proposed that is based on Machine Learning rather than
simulation techniques. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) representation of indoor
Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems is suggested, and signal propagation
is estimated. The simulation and performance predictions are accurate, fast and
require a reduced set of training sample size with respect to other
counterparts, making this solution very suitable for real time estimation of an
indoor VLC system. It is shown that by tweaking MLP parameters, such as sample
size, number of epochs and batch size, one can balance the desired level of
inference accuracy with training time and optimize the model's performance to
meet real-time requirements.

Conclusion: 提出的度量方法能有效评估数字孪生模拟的精度差异，为优化建模提供依据。

Abstract: The design of accurate Digital Twins (DTs) of electromagnetic environments
strictly depends on the fidelity of the underlying environmental modeling.
Evaluating the differences among diverse levels of modeling accuracy is key to
determine the relevance of the model features towards both efficient and
accurate DT simulations. In this paper, we propose two metrics, the Hausdorff
ray tracing (HRT) and chamfer ray tracing (CRT) distances, to consistently
compare the temporal, angular and power features between two ray tracing
simulations performed on 3D scenarios featured by environmental changes. To
evaluate the introduced metrics, we considered a high-fidelity digital twin
model of an area of Milan, Italy and we enriched it with two different types of
environmental changes: (i) the inclusion of parked vehicles meshes, and (ii)
the segmentation of the buildings facade faces to separate the windows mesh
components from the rest of the building. We performed grid-based and vehicular
ray tracing simulations at 28 GHz carrier frequency on the obtained scenarios
integrating the NVIDIA Sionna RT ray tracing simulator with the SUMO vehicular
traffic simulator. Both the HRT and CRT metrics highlighted the areas of the
scenarios where the simulated radio propagation features differ owing to the
introduced mesh integrations, while the vehicular ray tracing simulations
allowed to uncover the distance patterns arising along realistic vehicular
trajectories.

Conclusion: 该框架为图信号分析提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for discrete multiresolution analysis of graph
signals. The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined
in the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to
the analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining
samplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of
patches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets,
and eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures
orthogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to
properly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar
wavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can
efficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a
definition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction.
We support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs
whose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation,
we combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful
patches, with landmark \texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional
embeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness,
scalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable
approximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet
approaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity.

Motivation: 铁路车辆的安全和高效运行需要精确的实时定位，尤其是在复杂环境下。

Method: 粒子滤波器加权和序列对齐技术分别用于定位，并最终结合为混合方法。

Result: 粒子滤波器在21.6公里内实现5米以下精度，而序列对齐在冷启动下92%测试中定位误差小于30米。

Conclusion: 混合方法在实时性和鲁棒性上表现优异，适合安全关键应用。

Abstract: This work presents two complementary real-time rail vehicle localization
methods based on magnetic field measurements and a pre-recorded magnetic map.
The first uses a particle filter reweighted via magnetic similarity, employing
a heavy-tailed non-Gaussian kernel for enhanced stability. The second is a
stateless sequence alignment technique that transforms real-time magnetic
signals into the spatial domain and matches them to the map using a similarity
measure. Experiments with operational train data show that the particle filter
achieves track-selective, sub-5-meter accuracy over 21.6 km, though its
performance degrades at low speeds and during cold starts. Accuracy tests were
constrained by the GNSS-based reference system. In contrast, the
alignment-based method excels in cold-start scenarios, localizing within 30 m
in 92 % of tests (100 % using top-3 matches). A hybrid approach combines both
methods$\unicode{x2014}$alignment-based initialization followed by particle
filter tracking. Runtime analysis confirms real-time capability on
consumer-grade hardware. The system delivers accurate, robust localization
suitable for safety-critical rail applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拼接合成方法存在不连续性且依赖特定音频材料，本文旨在通过潜在向量级的颗粒合成解决这些问题。

Method: 构建潜在向量颗粒码本，将目标音频的潜在颗粒与码本匹配，解码生成混合序列以保留时间结构并转换音色。

Result: 该方法无需训练模型，适用于多种音频材料，且能通过解码器的隐式插值避免传统拼接合成的不连续性。

Conclusion: 该技术为音频再合成提供了高效灵活的工具，适用于广泛的音色转换应用。

Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for creative audio resynthesis that operates
by reworking the concept of granular synthesis at the latent vector level. Our
approach creates a "granular codebook" by encoding a source audio corpus into
latent vector segments, then matches each latent grain of a target audio signal
to its closest counterpart in the codebook. The resulting hybrid sequence is
decoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while
adopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model
training, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the
discontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the
codec's implicit interpolation during decoding. We include supplementary
material at https://github.com/naotokui/latentgranular/ , as well as a
proof-of-concept implementation to allow users to experiment with their own
sounds at https://huggingface.co/spaces/naotokui/latentgranular .

Abstract: Commercial high-voltage circuit breaker (CB) condition monitoring systems
rely on directly observable physical parameters such as gas filling pressure
with pre-defined thresholds. While these parameters are crucial, they only
cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored
only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition
monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques
such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition
monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for
fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially
introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however
not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In
this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation
framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can
detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault
diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated
unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of
detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data
required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided
fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential
indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics
without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are
validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy
and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB
system operation.
