In this study, we introduce the SNUPHY-M (Seoul\nNational University hospital PHYsiological signal Masked representation\nlearning) model extracts physiological features reflecting the electrical,\npressure, and fluid characteristics of the cardiac cycle in the process of\nrestoring three masked physiological signals based on self-supervised learning\n(SSL): ECG, PPG, and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. By employing\nmultiple physical characteristics, the model can extract more enriched features\nonly using non-invasive signals. We evaluated the model's performance in\nclinical downstream tasks such as hypotension, stroke volume, systolic blood\npressure, diastolic blood pressure, and age prediction. Our results showed that\nthe SNUPHY-M significantly outperformed supervised or SSL models, especially in\nprediction tasks using non-invasive signals.

In this paper, we introduce the improved Riemannian Potato\nField (iRPF), a fast and fully automated method for EEG artifact rejection that\naddresses key limitations of current approaches. We evaluate iRPF against\nseveral state-of-the-art artifact rejection methods, using two publicly\navailable EEG databases, labeled for various artifact types, comprising 226 EEG\nrecordings. Our results demonstrate that iRPF outperforms all competitors\nacross multiple metrics, with gains of up to 22% in recall, 102% in\nspecificity, 54% in precision, and 24% in F1-score, compared to Isolation\nForest, Autoreject, Riemannian Potato, and Riemannian Potato Field,\nrespectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these\nimprovements (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.8) in most\ncomparisons. Additionally, on a typical EEG recording iRPF performs artifact\ncleaning in under 8 milliseconds per epoch using a standard laptop,\nhighlighting its efficiency for large-scale EEG data processing and real-time\napplications. iRPF offers a robust and data-driven artifact rejection solution\nfor high-quality EEG pre-processing in brain-computer interfaces and clinical\nneuroimaging applications."}

While many robots imitate appearance and joint movements,\nlittle attention has been given to whole-body expansion-contraction,\nvolume-changing movements observed in living organisms, and their effect on\nanimacy perception. We developed a mobile robot called \"MOFU (Morphing Fluffy\nUnit),\" capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and\ncovered with a fluffy exterior. MOFU employs a \"Jitterbug\" structure, a\ngeometric transformation mechanism that enables smooth volume change in\ndiameter from 210 to 280 mm using one actuator. It is also equipped with a\ndifferential two-wheel drive mechanism for locomotion. To evaluate the effect\nof expansion-contraction movements, we conducted an online survey using videos\nof MOFU's behavior. Participants rated impressions with the Godspeed\nQuestionnaire Series. First, we compared videos of MOFU in a stationary state\nwith and without expansion-contraction and turning, finding that\nexpansion-contraction significantly increased perceived animacy. Second, we\nhypothesized that presenting two MOFUs would increase animacy compared with a\nsingle robot; however, this was not supported, as no significant difference\nemerged. Exploratory analyses further compared four dual-robot motion\nconditions. Third, when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion,\nanimacy ratings were higher than locomotion alone. These results suggest that\nvolume-changing movements such as expansion and contraction enhance perceived\nanimacy in robots and should be considered an important design element in\nfuture robot development aimed at shaping human impressions."}
