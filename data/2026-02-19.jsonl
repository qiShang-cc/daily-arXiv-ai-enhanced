To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes NeuroSleep, an integrated event-driven sensing and inference system for energy-efficient sleep staging. NeuroSleep first converts raw EEG into complementary multi-scale bipolar event streams using Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation (R-AMSDM), enabling an explicit fidelity-sparsity trade-off at the sensing front end. Furthermore, NeuroSleep adopts a hierarchical inference architecture that comprises an Event-based Adaptive Multi-scale Response (EAMR) module for local feature extraction, a Local Temporal-Attention Module (LTAM) for context aggregation, and an Epoch-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) module to capture long-term state persistence. Experimental results using subject-independent 5-fold cross-validation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset demonstrate that NeuroSleep achieves a mean accuracy of 74.2% with only 0.932 M parameters while reducing sparsity-adjusted effective operations by approximately 53.6% relative to dense processing. Compared with the representative dense Transformer baseline, NeuroSleep improves accuracy by 7.5% with a 45.8% reduction in computational load. By bridging neuromorphic encoding with state-aware modeling, NeuroSleep provides a scalable solution for always-on sleep analysis in resource-constrained wearable scenarios."}

However, its layer-by-layer process remains vulnerable to faults such as nozzle clogging, filament runout, and layer misalignment, which compromise print quality and reliability. Traditional inspection methods are costly, time-intensive, and often limited to post-process analysis, making them unsuitable for real-time intervention. In this current study, the authors developed a novel, low-cost, and portable faultdetection system that leverages multimodal sensor fusion and artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring in FDM-based 3D printing. The system integrates acoustic, vibration, and thermal sensing into a non-intrusive architecture, capturing complementary data streams that reflect both mechanical and process-related anomalies. Acoustic and thermal sensors operate in a fully contactless manner, while the vibration sensor requires minimal attachment such that it will not interfere with printer hardware, thereby preserving portability and ease of deployment. The multimodal signals are processed into spectrograms and time-frequency features, which are classified using convolutional neural networks for intelligent fault detection. The proposed system advances Industry 4.0 objectives by offering an affordable, scalable, and practical monitoring solution that improves faultdetection accuracy, reduces waste, and supports sustainable, adaptive manufacturing."}

For moving machinery, vibration analysis and control are crucial. Additive manufacturing is the basis of 3D printing, which utilizes mechanical movement of the extruder to fabricate objects, and faults occur due to unwanted vibrations. Therefore, it is vital to examine the vibration patterns of a 3D printer. In this work, we observe these parameters of an FDM printer, exemplified by the MakerBot Method X. To analyze the system, it is necessary to understand the motion it generates and select appropriate sensors to detect those motions. The sensor measurement values can be used to determine the condition of the printer. We used an accelerometer and an acoustic sensor to measure the vibration and sound produced by the printer. The outputs from these sensors were examined individually. The findings show that vibration occurs at relatively low levels during continuous motion because it mainly appears at component transition edges. Due to abrupt acceleration and deceleration during zigzag motion, vibration reaches its peak."}

Simulation-based scenario testing provides a safe and cost-effective alternative to extensive on-road trials, enabling efficient evaluation of ADS under diverse and high-risk conditions. However, existing approaches mainly evaluates the scenarios based on their proximity to collisions and focus on scenarios already close to collision, leaving many other hazardous situations unexplored. To bridge this, we introduce a collision-related concept of conflict as an intermediate search target and propose a two-stage scenario testing framework that first searches for conflicts and then mutates these conflict scenarios to induce actual collisions. Evaluated on Baidu Apollo, our approach reveals up to 12 distinct collision types in a single run, doubling the diversity discovered by state-of-the-art baselines while requiring fewer simulations thanks to conflict-targeted mutations.

In this framework, the communication performance is measured by the multicast rate considering max-min fairness. Moreover, the sensing performance is quantified by the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB), where a Gauss-Hermite quadrature-based approach is proposed to compute the Bayesian Fisher information matrix. Based on these metrics, PA placement is optimized under three criteria: communications-centric (C-C), sensing-centric (S-C), and Pareto-optimal designs. These designs are investigated in two scenarios: the single-PA case and the multi-PA case. 1) For the single-PA case, a closed-form solution is derived for the location of the C-C transmit PA, while the S-C design yields optimal transmit and receive PA placements that are symmetric about the target location. Leveraging this geometric insight, the Pareto-optimal design is solved by enforcing this PA placement symmetry, thereby reducing the joint transmit and receive PA placement to the transmit PA optimization. 2) For the general multi-PA case, the PA placements constitute a highly non-convex optimization problem. To solve this, an element-wise alternating optimization-based method is proposed to sequentially optimize all PA placements for the S-C design, and is further incorporated into an augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework and a rate-profile formulation to solve the C-C and Pareto-optimal design problems, respectively. Numerical results show that: i) PASS substantially outperforms fixed-antenna baselines in both multicast rate and sensing accuracy; ii) the multicasting gain becomes more pronounced as the user density increases; and iii) the sensing accuracy improves with the number of deployed PAs."}

A data-processing framework, called SeaSpoofFinder, available here: seaspooffinder.github.io/ais_data, was developed to ingest and post-process global AIS streams and to detect candidate anomalies through a two-stage procedure. In Stage 1, implausible position jumps are identified using kinematic and data-quality filters; in Stage 2, events are retained only when multiple vessels exhibit spatially consistent source and target clustering, thereby reducing false positives from single-vessel artifacts. The resulting final potential spoofing events (FPSEs) reveal recurrent patterns in several regions, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Murmansk, Moscow, and the Haifa area, with affected footprints that can span large maritime areas. The analysis also highlights recurring non-spoofing artifacts (e.g., back-to-port jumps and data gaps) that can still pass heuristic filters in dense traffic regions. These results indicate that AIS-based monitoring can provide useful evidence for identifying and characterizing potential spoofing activity at scale, while emphasizing that AIS-only evidence does not provide definitive attribution."}

To map the field, we systematically reviewed empirical studies from 2015 to 2025. Of 6,527 peer-reviewed articles, only 33 met strict inclusion criteria. We examined (1) how XR and virtual social robots are used and in which contexts, (2) data collection and analysis methods, (3) demographics of the researchers and participants, and (4) the stated challenges and future agendas. Our findings show that social XR-HRI research is still dominated by laboratory simulations, while crucial specifications like used hardware, software, and robots are often not reported. Robots typically act as passive and less interactive visual stimuli, while the rich biosignal (e.g., eye-tracking) and logging functions of modern head-mounted displays remain largely untapped. The research teams and samples are predominantly tech-centric, Western, young, and male, with frequent gaps in demographic reporting. Key limitations include hardware delays, small homogeneous samples, and short, shallow study cycles. We propose a five-phase roadmap to establish social XR-HRI as a reliable research medium, which includes fostering methodological innovation, a reinforced ecological validity by, e.g., using application contexts, the improvement of the robot's interaction quality, promoting diversity in the sample and the development of a social XR-HRI taxonomy. Advancing in these directions is essential for XR to mature from a lab prototype into an ecologically valid research instrument for social robotics."}

In this paper, we propose a neural network-based approach using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to directly map RSS-AoA measurements to 3D positions, capturing nonlinear relationships that are difficult to model with traditional methods. We evaluate the impact of input representation by comparing networks trained on raw measurements versus preprocessed features derived from a linearization method. Simulation results show that the learning-based approach consistently outperforms existing linear methods under RSS noise across all noise levels, and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance under increasing AoA noise. Furthermore, preprocessing measurements using the linearization method provides a clear advantage over raw data, demonstrating the benefit of geometry-aware feature extraction."}

In contrast, humans plan using maps: we reason globally first, then act locally. We introduce ReasonNavi, a human-inspired framework that operationalizes this reason-then-act paradigm by coupling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with deterministic planners. ReasonNavi converts a top-down map into a discrete reasoning space by room segmentation and candidate target nodes sampling. An MLLM is then queried in a multi-stage process to identify the candidate most consistent with the instruction (object, image, or text goal), effectively leveraging the model's semantic reasoning ability while sidestepping its weakness in continuous coordinate prediction. The selected waypoint is grounded into executable trajectories using a deterministic action planner over an online-built occupancy map, while pretrained object detectors and segmenters ensure robust recognition at the goal. This yields a unified zero-shot navigation framework that requires no MLLM fine-tuning, circumvents the brittleness of RL-based policies and scales naturally with foundation model improvements. Across three navigation tasks, ReasonNavi consistently outperforms prior methods that demand extensive training or heavy scene modeling, offering a scalable, interpretable, and globally grounded solution to embodied navigation.

We propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, in which the preparation phase performs direction estimation for outdoor users located in the reflection space, while maintaining communication with both outdoor and indoor users in the transmission space. The subsequent communication phase exploits the estimated directions to enhance information transfer. The directions of outdoor users are modeled as Gaussian random variables to capture estimation uncertainty, and the corresponding average communication performance is incorporated into the design. Building on this framework, we formulate a performance-balanced optimization problem that maximizes the communication sum-rate while guaranteeing the required sensing accuracy, jointly determining the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS), the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, and the metasurface partition between energy-splitting and transmit-only modes. The physical constraints of STAR-RIS elements and the required sensing performance are explicitly enforced. To address the non-convex nature of the problem, we combine fractional programming, Lagrangian dual reformulation, and successive convex approximation. The binary metasurface partition is ultimately recovered via continuous relaxation followed by projection-based binarization.

Wavefront tomography is a technique that uses multiple wavefront measurements from various viewing angles to non-invasively measure the 3D density field of a turbulent medium. Existing methods make strong assumptions, such as a spline basis representation, to address the ill-conditioned nature of this problem. We formulate this problem as a Bayesian, sparse-view tomographic reconstruction problem and develop a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm for measuring the volumetric 3D density field inside a wind tunnel. We call this method WindDensity-MBIR and apply it using simulated data to difficult reconstruction scenarios with sparse data, small projection field of view, and limited angular extent. WindDensity-MBIR can recover high-order features in these scenarios within 10% to 25% error even when the tip, tilt, and piston are removed from the wavefront measurements."}

To mitigate synchronization-induced common phase drifts, the difference of Möbius transformation (DMT) is integrated into the deep learning framework, named DMTNet, to jointly configure multiple active RIS elements. Notably, the training data are generated in simulation without collecting real-world measurements, and the resulting phase selector is validated experimentally. For sensing, multi-antenna measurements are fused by the DC-offset calibration and the DeepMining-MMV processing with CA-CFAR detection and Newton's refinements.

However, the cascaded AmBC channel suffers from severe double path loss and multiplicative fading, while accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is highly challenging due to the weak backscattered signal and the resource-limited nature of BDs. To address these challenges, this paper considers an AmBC system in which the reader is equipped with a pixel-based fluid antenna system (FAS). By dynamically selecting one antenna position from a dense set of pixels within a compact aperture, the FAS-enabled reader exploits spatial diversity through measurement-driven port selection, without requiring explicit CSI acquisition or multiple RF chains. The intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff at the BD is also incorporated by jointly optimizing the backscatter modulation coefficient under an energy harvesting (EH) neutrality constraint. To efficiently solve this problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based framework is developed to jointly determine the FAS port selection and modulation coefficient on an optimize-then-average (OTA) basis. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the achievable rate compared with conventional single-antenna readers, with gains preserved under imperfect observations, stringent EH constraints, and different pixel spacings."}

Unlike standard Gaussian noise, signal reflection from debris introduces strictly non-negative ranging biases. Existing robust estimators, typically designed with symmetric loss functions (e.g., Huber or Tukey), implicitly rely on the assumption of error symmetry. Consequently, they experience a theoretical mismatch in this regime, leading to a phenomenon we formally identify as Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy (SGD)-a state where the estimator stagnates due to the coupling of persistent asymmetric bias and limited observation geometry. While emerging data-driven approaches offer alternatives, they often struggle with the scarcity of training data and the sim-to-real gap inherent in unstructured disaster zones. In this work, we propose a physically-grounded solution, the AsymmetricHuberEKF, which explicitly incorporates the non-negative physical prior of NLOS biases via a derived asymmetric loss function. Theoretically, we show that standard symmetric filters correspond to a degenerate case of our framework where the physical constraint is relaxed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that resolving SGD requires not just a robust filter, but specific bilateral information, which we achieve through a co-designed active sensing strategy. Validated in a 2D nadir-view scanning scenario, our approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to symmetric baselines, offering a resilient building block for search operations where data is scarce and geometry is constrained."}

Closed-form expressions for the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator and the corresponding estimation error are derived. A fundamental comparison with discrete port-based architectures is established under identical position constraints, showing that continuous FA sampling achieves equal or lower estimation error for any finite pilot budget, with strict improvement for non-degenerate spatial correlation models.

We study the problem of SPIR on graph-replicated database systems, where each node of the graph represents a server and each link represents a message. Each message is replicated at exactly two servers; those at which the link representing the message is incident. To ensure database privacy, the servers share a set of common randomness, independent of the database and the user's desired message index. We study two cases of common randomness distribution to the servers: i) graph-replicated common randomness, and ii) fully-replicated common randomness. Given a graph-replicated database system, in i), we assign one randomness variable independently to every pair of servers sharing a message, while in ii), we assign an identical set of randomness variable to all servers, irrespective of the underlying graph. In both settings, our goal is to characterize the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum number of desired message symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol, and quantify the minimum amount of common randomness required to achieve the capacity. To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes."}

However, all of these approaches are limited by the image captured these conditions. An alternate approach is to utilize a programmable onboard light that adds to ambient illumination and improves captured images. However, it is not straightforward to predict its impact on image formation. Illumination interacts nonlinearly with depth, surface reflectance, and scene geometry. It can both reveal structure and induce failure modes such as specular highlights and saturation. We introduce Lightning, a closed-loop illumination-control framework for visual SLAM that combines relighting, offline optimization, and imitation learning. This is performed in three stages. First, we train a Co-Located Illumination Decomposition (CLID) relighting model that decomposes a robot observation into an ambient component and a light-contribution field. CLID enables physically consistent synthesis of the same scene under alternative light intensities and thereby creates dense multi-intensity training data without requiring us to repeatedly re-run trajectories. Second, using these synthesized candidates, we formulate an offline Optimal Intensity Schedule (OIS) problem that selects illumination levels over a sequence trading off SLAM-relevant image utility against power consumption and temporal smoothness. Third, we distill this ideal solution into a real-time controller through behavior cloning, producing an Illumination Control Policy (ILC) that generalizes beyond the initial training distribution and runs online on a mobile robot to command discrete light-intensity levels. Across our evaluation, Lightning substantially improves SLAM trajectory robustness while reducing unnecessary illumination power."}

For spacecraft with complex dynamics, obtaining accurate physics-based models can be difficult, time-consuming, or computationally heavy. Learning-based system identification presents a compelling alternative; however, models trained exclusively on data frequently exhibit fragile stability properties and limited extrapolation capability. This work explores Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling spacecraft attitude dynamics and contrasts it with a conventional data-driven approach. A comprehensive dataset is generated using high-fidelity numerical simulations, and two learning methodologies are investigated: a purely data-driven pipeline and a physics-regularized approach that incorporates prior knowledge into the optimization process. The results indicate that embedding physical constraints during training leads to substantial improvements in predictive reliability, achieving a 68.17% decrease in mean relative error relative. When deployed within an MPC architecture, the physics-informed models yield superior closed-loop tracking performance and improved robustness to uncertainty. Furthermore, a hybrid control formulation that merges the learned nonlinear dynamics with a nominal linear model enables consistent steady-state convergence and significantly faster response, reducing settling times by 61.52%-76.42% under measurement noise and reaction wheel friction."}

In many situations, these objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously, and explicit priority relations naturally arise. Also, driving rules require context, so it is important to formally model the environment scenarios within which such rules apply. Existing benchmarks for evaluating autonomous vehicles lack such combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models. In this work, we introduce ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments under prioritized multi-objective specifications. We first formalize a diverse set of objectives to serve as quantitative evaluation metrics. Next, we design a Hierarchical Rulebook framework that encodes multiple objectives and their priority relations in an interpretable and adaptable manner.

A multimodal tactile stack combines piezoelectric (PzE) sensing for fast slip cues with piezoresistive (PzR) arrays for contact localization, enabling online construction of the grasp matrix. Upon slip, we update internal forces computed in the null space of the grasp via a quadratic program that preserves the object wrench while enforcing actuation limits. The pipeline yields a theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40 ms, with 5 ms for PzR-based contact and geometry updates and about 4 ms for the quadratic program solve. In controlled trials, slip onset is detected at 20ms. We demonstrate closed-loop stabilization on multifingered grasps under external perturbations. Augmenting efficient analytic force control with learned tactile cues yields both robustness and rapid reactions, as confirmed in our end-to-end evaluation. Measured delays are dominated by the experimental data path rather than actual computation. The analysis outlines a clear route to sub-50 ms closed-loop stabilization."}

First, static prediction models (i.e., random forest and neural network regressors) are trained to estimate the maximum exerted force achieved from input variables such as muscle sample, electrical stimulation parameters, and baseline exerted force. Second, a dynamic modeling framework, based on Long Short-Term Memory networks, is developed to serve as a digital twin, replicating the time series of exerted forces observed in response to electrical stimulation. Both modeling approaches demonstrate high predictive accuracy. The best performance of the static models is characterized by R2 of 0.9425, whereas the dynamic model achieves R2 of 0.9956.

A modular whole-body modeling framework is introduced, in which compliant leg dynamics are represented through physically consistent reaction forces applied to a rigid torso, providing a scalable interface between continuum soft limbs and rigid-body locomotion dynamics. This formulation allows efficient whole-body simulation and real-time control without sacrificing physical fidelity.

Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions.

Existing methods fragment fall safety into separate problems such as fall avoidance, impact mitigation, and stand-up recovery, or rely on end-to-end policies trained without vision through reinforcement learning or imitation learning, often on flat terrain. At a deeper level, fall safety is treated as monolithic data complexity, coupling pose, dynamics, and terrain and requiring exhaustive coverage, limiting scalability and generalization. We present a unified fall safety approach that spans all phases of fall recovery. It builds on two insights: 1) Natural human fall and recovery poses are highly constrained and transferable from flat to complex terrain through alignment, and 2) Fast whole-body reactions require integrated perceptual-motor representations. We train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, and distill it into a deployable student that relies only on egocentric depth and proprioception. The student learns how to react by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation, which combines the next target pose with the local terrain, rather than separately encoding what it must perceive and how it must act.

Intuitively, high-rate measurements from accurate sensors lead to accurate trajectory estimation. However, cost and resource constraints limit the sensor accuracy and its measurement rate. Our work's novel contribution is the estimation of sensor schedules and sensor covariances necessary to achieve a specific estimation accuracy. Concretely, we focus on estimating: (i) the rate or schedule with which a sensor of known covariance must generate measurements to achieve specific estimation accuracy, and alternatively, (ii) the sensor covariance necessary to achieve specific estimation accuracy for a given sensor update rate. We formulate the problem of estimating these sensor parameters as semidefinite programs, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers.

However, traditional freehand imaging procedure suffers from inconsistent, operator-dependent outcomes, lack of 3D localization information, and risks of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. While robotic ultrasound (RUS) systems offer the potential for standardized, operator-independent 3D kidney data acquisition, the existing scanning methods lack the ability to determine the optimal imaging window for efficient imaging. As a result, the scan is often blindly performed with excessive probe footprint, which frequently leads to acoustic shadowing and incomplete organ coverage. Consequently, there is a critical need for a spatially efficient imaging technique that can maximize the kidney coverage through minimum probe footprint. Here, we propose an autonomous workflow to achieve efficient kidney imaging via template-guided optimal pivoting. The system first performs an explorative imaging to generate partial observations of the kidney. This data is then registered to a kidney template to estimate the organ pose. With the kidney localized, the robot executes a fixed-point pivoting sweep where the imaging plane is aligned with the kidney long axis to minimize the probe translation. The proposed method was validated in simulation and in-vivo. Simulation results indicate that a 60% exploration ratio provides optimal balance between kidney localization accuracy and scanning efficiency. In-vivo evaluation on two male subjects demonstrates a kidney localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and 13.84 degrees. Moreover, the optimal pivoting approach shortened the probe footprint by around 75 mm when compared with the baselines. These results valid our approach of leveraging anatomical templates to align the probe optimally for volumetric sweep."}

We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture."}

Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. We believe the advances in this paper can open up new ways of training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects."}

While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior."}

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a parameterized canonical representation that unifies a broad spectrum of dexterous hand architectures. It comprises a unified parameter space and a canonical URDF format, offering three key advantages. 1) The parameter space captures essential morphological and kinematic variations for effective conditioning in learning algorithms. 2) A structured latent manifold can be learned over our space, where interpolations between embodiments yield smooth and physically meaningful morphology transitions. 3) The canonical URDF standardizes the action space while preserving dynamic and functional properties of the original URDFs, enabling efficient and reliable cross-embodiment policy learning. We validate these advantages through extensive analysis and experiments, including grasp policy replay, VAE latent encoding, and cross-embodiment zero-shot transfer. Specifically, we train a VAE on the unified representation to obtain a compact, semantically rich latent embedding, and develop a grasping policy conditioned on the canonical representation that generalizes across dexterous hands. We demonstrate, through simulation and real-world tasks on unseen morphologies (e.g., 81.9% zero-shot success rate on 3-finger LEAP Hand), that our framework unifies both the representational and action spaces of structurally diverse hands, providing a scalable foundation for cross-hand learning toward universal dexterous manipulation."}

LiDAR super-resolution addresses this challenge by using deep learning to enhance sparse point clouds, bridging the gap between different sensor types and enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Current trends include the adoption of range image representation for efficient processing, extreme model compression and the development of resolution-flexible architectures. Recent research prioritizes real-time inference and cross-sensor generalization for practical deployment. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future research directions for advancing LiDAR super-resolution technology."}

SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention."}
