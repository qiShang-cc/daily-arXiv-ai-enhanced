### [1] [Efficient Near-Field Beam Focusing Merging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit and CVX for Large Intelligent Surface Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09711)
*Jiawang Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种高效的近场波束成形方法，用于6G网络中的大规模智能表面（LIS），通过预选稀疏目标位置和坐标镜像对称显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统凸优化方法在大规模阵列矩阵中计算时间过长，需改进以支持6G网络中的大规模智能表面应用。

Method: 结合正交匹配追踪（OMP）预选稀疏目标位置，利用坐标镜像对称减少计算量，再基于预选稀疏阵列应用凸优化。

Result: 相比传统方法，效率提升15.12倍（121元素）和96.73倍（441元素），性能表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, an efficient near-field beamforming method is proposed to
support the large intelligent surfaces (LIS) that are expected to be widely
deployed in 6G networks. This approach avoids directly applying convex (CVX)
optimization for sparse selection in large-size array matrices, as such methods
often lead to excessive computational time due to blind searching to satisfy a
series of objective functions. First, based on the objective function, we
prioritize a key component and employ the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)
method to pre-select potential sparse target positions. To ensure focal
symmetry, a coordinate mirror symmetry approach is adopted, meaning that
selection is performed only in the first quadrant, while the remaining
quadrants are determined through mirror symmetry relative to the first
quadrant. This significantly reduces computational complexity at an early
stage. Next, CVX is applied based on the pre-selected sparse array. Once a
predefined threshold is met, a solution is obtained that satisfies the
constraints of the beamfocusing. The results demonstrate that, compared with
conventional methods, this approach improves efficiency by 15.12 times with 121
elements and 96.73 times with 441 elements. The proposed method demonstrates
not only satisfactory performance but also considerable potential as a beam
focusing technique for large-scale near-field array systems.

Conclusion: FA-LLM在卫星物联网网络中展现出LLM预测的高潜力，适用于未来通信系统的链路适配。

Abstract: This paper proposes FAS-LLM, a novel large language model (LLM)-based
architecture for predicting future channel states in Orthogonal Time Frequency
Space (OTFS)-enabled satellite downlinks equipped with fluid antenna systems
(FAS). The proposed method introduces a two-stage channel compression strategy
combining reference-port selection and separable principal component analysis
(PCA) to extract compact, delay-Doppler-aware representations from
high-dimensional OTFS channels. These representations are then embedded into a
LoRA-adapted LLM, enabling efficient time-series forecasting of channel
coefficients. Performance evaluations demonstrate that FAS-LLM outperforms
classical baselines including GRU, LSTM, and Transformer models, achieving up
to 10 dB normalized mean squared error (NMSE) improvement and threefold root
mean squared error (RMSE) reduction across prediction horizons. Furthermore,
the predicted channels preserve key physical-layer characteristics, enabling
near-optimal performance in ergodic capacity, spectral efficiency, and outage
probability across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). These results
highlight the potential of LLM-based forecasting for delay-sensitive and
energy-efficient link adaptation in future satellite IoT networks.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided terahertz (THz)-band
communications are promising enablers for future wireless networks. However,
array densification at high frequencies introduces significant challenges in
accurate channel modeling and estimation, particularly with THz-specific
fading, mutual coupling (MC), spatial correlation, and near-field effects. In
this work, we model THz outdoor small-scale fading channels using the mixture
gamma (MG) distribution, considering absorption losses, spherical wave
propagation, MC, and spatial correlation across large base stations and RISs.
We derive the distribution of the cascaded RIS-aided channel and investigate
linear channel estimation techniques, analyzing the impact of various channel
parameters. Numerical results based on precise THz parameters reveal that
accounting for spatial correlation, MC, and near-field modeling substantially
enhances estimation accuracy, especially in ultra-massive arrays and
short-range scenarios. These results underscore the importance of incorporating
these effects for precise, physically consistent channel modeling.

Abstract: There is currently a paradigm shift in several power system monitoring
applications, such as incipient fault detection and monitoring inverter-based
resources, to transition from traditional phasor analytics to more informative
waveform analytics. This paper contributes to this transition by developing a
novel approach to modeling voltage and current waveform measurements using
implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs are continuous function
approximators that are recently used in vision and signal processing. The
proposed INR models are specifically designed to meet the requirements of
waveform analytics in power systems, such as by using sinusoidal activation
functions that capture the periodic nature of voltage and current waveforms. We
also propose extended models that can efficiently represent correlated
waveforms, such as three-phase waveforms and synchro-waveforms. Real-world case
studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed INR models in terms of
accuracy (<1-2% MSE) and model size (4-6x compression). We also investigate the
application of INR models in oscillation monitoring, for single mode
oscillations and dual mode modulated oscillations.

*Sreeni Poolakkal,Abdullah Islam,Arpit Rao,Shrestha Bansal,Ted Dabrowski,Kalsi Kwan,Zhongxuan Wang,Amit Kumar Mishra,Julio Navarro,Shenqiang Ren,John Williams,Sudip Shekhar,Subhanshu Gupta*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态波束稳定处理器和低成本铜分子分解墨水，解决了共形相控阵在动态变形和材料氧化中的两大问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形相控阵在可穿戴、航空航天等领域有广泛应用，但存在动态变形导致的波束指向误差和传统打印墨水（如银或铜）的高成本或氧化问题。

Method: 采用动态波束稳定处理器（DBS）实时控制每个单元的基本增益、相位和延迟，并使用低成本铜分子分解（CuMOD）墨水减少温度和应变带来的阻抗变化。

Abstract: Conformal phased arrays promise shape-changing properties, multiple degrees
of freedom to the scan angle, and novel applications in wearables, aerospace,
defense, vehicles, and ships. However, they have suffered from two critical
limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication
and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic
deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic
Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip
real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2)
Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility,
but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based
on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance
and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper
Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with < 0.1% variation per degree C with
temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using
the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation
correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable
due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.

Abstract: In the rapid evolution of the non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), satellite
communication has emerged as a focal area of research due to its critical role
in enabling seamless global connectivity. In this paper, we investigate two
representative user association policies (UAPs) for multi-tier heterogeneous
satellite networks (HetSatNets), namely the nearest satellite UAP and the
maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (max-SINR) satellite UAP, where
each tier is characterized by a distinct constellation configuration and
transmission pattern. Employing stochastic geometric, we analyze various
intermediate system aspects, including the probability of a typical user
accessing each satellite tier, the aggregated interference power, and their
corresponding Laplace transforms (LTs) under both UAPs. Subsequently, we derive
explicit expressions for coverage probability (CP), non-handover probability
(NHP), and time delay outage probability (DOP) of the typical user.
Furthermore, we propose a novel weighted metric (WM) that integrates CP, NHP,
and DOP to explore their trade-offs in the system design. The robustness of the
theoretical framework is verified is verified through Monte Carlo simulations
calibrated with the actual Starlink constellation, affirming the precision of
our analytical approach. The empirical findings underscore an optimal UAP in
various HetSatNet scenarios regarding CP, NHP, and DOP..

### [7] [Constrained Multimodal Sensing-Aided Communications: A Dynamic Beamforming Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10015)
*Abolfazl Zakeri,Nhan Thanh Nguyen,Ahmed Alkhateeb,Markku Juntti*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种受约束的多模态感知辅助通信框架，通过动态感知和波束成形在感知预算下最大化用户设备的平均信噪比（SNR），同时限制感知动作次数和功耗。数值评估结果表明，感知时间减半仅导致平均SNR最多下降7.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态感知数据虽然能提升通信系统性能（如减少波束训练开销和延迟），但其高计算复杂度和连续感知带来的功耗与带宽问题引发了感知数据获取率与通信性能之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用基于Saleh-Valenzuela毫米波信道模型的动态感知与波束成形算法，利用Lyapunov优化方法解决在感知预算约束下最大化平均SNR的优化问题。

Result: 在DeepSense和Raymobtime数据集上的实验显示，将感知时间减半仅导致平均SNR最多损失7.7%，证明了算法的高效性。

Conclusion: 所提框架在有限感知资源下实现了通信性能与感知开销的有效权衡，为多模态感知辅助通信系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Using multimodal sensory data can enhance communications systems by reducing
the overhead and latency in beam training. However, processing such data incurs
high computational complexity, and continuous sensing results in significant
power and bandwidth consumption. This gives rise to a tradeoff between the
(multimodal) sensing data acquisition rate and communications performance. In
this work, we develop a constrained multimodal sensing-aided communications
framework where dynamic sensing and beamforming are performed under a sensing
budget. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the
average received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of user equipment, subject to
constraints on the average number of sensing actions and power budget. Using
the Saleh-Valenzuela mmWave channel model, we construct the channel primarily
based on position information obtained via multimodal sensing. Stricter sensing
constraints reduce the availability of position data, leading to degraded
channel estimation and thus lower performance. We apply Lyapunov optimization
to solve the problem and derive a dynamic sensing and beamforming algorithm.
Numerical evaluations on the DeepSense and Raymobtime datasets show that
halving sensing times leads to only up to 7.7% loss in average SNR.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究了窄带近场系统在不同天线阵列配置（SIMO/MISO和MIMO）下的传感性能，发现MIMO处理能将最大近场范围与传感分辨率提高约1.4倍，并通过理论推导和仿真验证了这一结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信系统的下一代发展需要关注辐射近场与传感能力的结合，本研究旨在评估不同天线配置在近场传感中的性能差异。

Method: 分析了多种实际天线阵列配置（如SIMO/MISO和MIMO）的传感性能，通过理论推导和数值仿真对比了单孔径与双孔径处理的差异。

Result: MIMO配置将最大近场范围和传感分辨率提高了约1.4倍，且对不同的阵列几何结构具有一致性。理论推导进一步验证了这一改进因子为√2。

Conclusion: 研究表明MIMO配置在近场传感中性能显著优于单孔径系统，为下一代无线通信系统中的传感技术提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The radiative near-field and integration of sensing capabilities are seen as
two key components of the next generation of wireless communication systems. In
this paper, the sensing performance of a narrowband near-field system is
investigated for several practical antenna array geometries and configurations,
namely SIMO/MISO and MIMO. In the SIMO/MISO configuration, the antenna aperture
is exploited only a single time for either transmit or receive signal
processing, while the MIMO configuration exploits both TX and RX processing.
Analytical derivations, supported by simulations, show that the MIMO processing
improves the maximum near-field range and sensing resolution by approximately a
factor of 1.4 as compared to single-aperture systems. The value of the
improvement factor is consistent for all considered array geometries. Finally,
using a quadratic approximation of the array factor, an analytical improvement
factor of $\sqrt{2}$ is derived, clarifying the observed improvements and
validating the numerical results.

### [9] [Angle diversity receiver as a key enabler for reliable ORIS-based Visible Light Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10129)
*Borja Genoves Guzman,Maximo Morales-Cespedes,Ana Garcia Armada,Maite Brandt-Pearce*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了结合角度分集接收器(ADR)和光学可重构智能表面(ORIS)在可见光通信(VLC)多用户系统中的互补性，通过优化算法提升信号质量，证明其显著优于无ORIS系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLC虽满足无线数据需求增长，但链路阻塞问题突出。研究旨在通过ADR和ORIS结合解决此问题。

Method: 采用ADR与ORIS结合，ORIS为可移动小镜子，提出优化算法最大化最低信噪比(SNR)，确保公平通信网络。

Result: 数值结果显示，ADR与ORIS整合显著提升VLC性能，SNR增益达30 dB，有效缓解链路阻塞或视野外信号问题。

Conclusion: ADR与ORIS互补性强，单层光电二极管即可有效支持ORIS辅助VLC，为未来设计提供重要指导。

Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) offers a promising solution to satisfy the
increasing demand for wireless data. However, link blockages remain a
significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by investigating the
combined use of angle diversity receivers (ADRs) and optical reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (ORISs) in multiuser VLC systems. We consider ORIS
elements as small movable mirrors. We demonstrate the complementarity of ADR
and ORIS in mitigating link blockages, as well as the advantages of using a
larger number of ORIS elements due to the increased field-of-view (FoV) at the
receiver enabled by the ADR. An optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize
the minimum signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) to deploy a fair communication
network. Numerical results show that integrating ADR and ORIS significantly
enhances VLC communication performance, achieving an SNR gain of up to 30 dB
compared to a system without ORIS, and mitigating communication outages
produced by link blockages or out-of-FoV received signals. We also prove that
an ADR with a single tier of photodiodes is sufficient to complement
ORIS-assisted VLC.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于基础模型的无线定位解决方案LWLM，通过自监督学习（SSL）框架优化三个互补目标，显著提升了定位任务性能，并展示了强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法需要大量标注数据且难以泛化，5G/6G应用中高精度定位需求迫切，促使研究基础模型解决方案。

Method: 设计自监督学习框架（SF-MCM、DTI、PICL三目标联合优化），结合轻量级解码器处理下游任务（如ToA、AoA估计等）。

Result: LWLM在所有定位任务中均超越模型基线和监督学习方法，尤其在无预训练的Transformer模型上提升26.0%-87.5%，标签有限时仍泛化良好。

Conclusion: LWLM作为无线定位基础模型具有潜力，其多视角语义捕获设计与轻量解码器为实际部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G
applications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart
manufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing
models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across
deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations,
we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless
localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL)
tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on
information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a
pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model
(LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three
complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling
(SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii)
position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly
capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple
perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks,
including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation,
single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization.
Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses
both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization
tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer
models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under
label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its
potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了CFARNet，一种基于学习的处理框架，用卷积神经网络（CNN）替换传统CFAR检测器，用于毫米波OFDM雷达中的多目标检测，显著提升了低信噪比下的性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决毫米波OFDM雷达中多个紧密相邻目标的精确检测问题，尤其是在低信噪比和多目标密集环境下传统CFAR检测器的性能不足。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络（CNN）进行峰值检测，结合已知的频率-角度映射进行角度估计，并使用MUSIC算法进行高分辨率距离和速度估计。

Result: 在仿真中，CFARNet显著优于CFAR+MUSIC基线，尤其在低发射功率和多目标密集条件下表现出更高的角度分辨率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的方法在高分辨率毫米波雷达感知中具有潜力，CFARNet在性能和计算效率上的优势为实际应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) OFDM radar equipped with rainbow beamforming,
enabled by joint phase-time arrays (JPTAs), provides wide-angle coverage and is
well-suited for fast real-time target detection and tracking. However, accurate
detection of multiple closely spaced targets remains a key challenge for
conventional signal processing pipelines, particularly those relying on
constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors. This paper presents CFARNet, a
learning-based processing framework that replaces CFAR with a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for peak detection in the angle-Doppler domain. The
network predicts target subcarrier indices, which guide angle estimation via a
known frequency-angle mapping and enable high-resolution range and velocity
estimation using the MUSIC algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that
CFARNet significantly outperforms a CFAR+MUSIC baseline, especially under low
transmit power and dense multi-target conditions. The proposed method offers
superior angular resolution, enhanced robustness in low-SNR scenarios, and
improved computational efficiency, highlighting the potential of data-driven
approaches for high-resolution mmWave radar sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双静态传感在集成传感与通信系统中具有吸引力，但广泛分布的发射器和接收器之间的时钟异步导致时间偏移和相位偏移变化，带来显著挑战。

Abstract: Bi-static sensing is an attractive configuration for integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) systems; however, clock asynchronism between widely
separated transmitters and receivers introduces time-varying time offsets (TO)
and phase offsets (PO), posing significant challenges. This paper introduces a
signal-subspace-based framework that estimates decoupled angles, delays, and
complex gain sequences (CGS)-- the target-reflected signals -- for multiple
dynamic target paths. The proposed framework begins with a novel TO alignment
algorithm, leveraging signal subspace or covariance, to mitigate TO variations
across temporal snapshots, enabling coherent delay-domain analysis.
Subsequently, subspace-based methods are developed to compensate for TO
residuals and to perform joint angle-delay estimation. Finally, leveraging the
high resolution in the joint angle-delay domain, the framework compensates for
the PO and estimates the CGS for each target. The framework can be applied to
both single-antenna and multi-antenna systems. Extensive simulations and
experiments using commercial Wi-Fi devices demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly surpasses existing solutions in parameter estimation
accuracy and delay resolution. Notably, it uniquely achieves a super-resolution
in the delay domain, with a probability-of-resolution curve tightly approaching
that in synchronized systems.

Conclusion: PASS系统在ISAC中展现更优性能，为无线通信与感知一体化提供新思路。

Abstract: The Pinching-Antenna SyStem (PASS) reconstructs wireless channels through
\emph{pinching beamforming}, wherein the activated positions of pinching
antennas along dielectric waveguides are optimized to shape the radiation
pattern. The aim of this article is to analyze the performance limits of
employing PASS in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Specifically, a
PASS-assisted ISAC system is considered, where a pinched waveguide is utilized
to simultaneously communicate with a user and sense a target. Closed-form
expressions for the achievable communication rate (CR) and sensing rate (SR)
are derived to characterize the information-theoretic limits of this
dual-functional operation. \romannumeral1) For the single-pinch case,
closed-form solutions for the optimal pinching antenna location are derived
under \emph{sensing-centric (S-C)}, \emph{communications-centric (C-C)}, and
\emph{Pareto-optimal} designs. On this basis, the CR-SR trade-off is
characterized by deriving the full CR-SR rate region, which is shown to
encompass that of conventional fixed-antenna systems. \romannumeral2) For the
multiple-pinch case, an antenna location refinement method is applied to obtain
the optimal C-C and S-C pinching beamformers. As a further advance, inner and
outer bounds on the achievable CR-SR region are derived using an element-wise
alternating optimization technique and by invoking Cauchy-Schwarz and
Karamata's inequalities, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate that:
\romannumeral1) the derived bounds closely approximate the true CR-SR region;
and \romannumeral2) PASS can achieve a significantly larger rate region than
conventional-antenna systems.

Abstract: Fingerprint-based passive localization enables high localization accuracy
using low-cost UWB IoT radio sensors. However, fingerprinting demands extensive
effort for data acquisition. The concept of channel charting reduces this
effort by modeling and projecting the manifold of \ac{csi} onto a 2D coordinate
space. So far, researchers only applied this concept to active radio
localization, where a mobile device intentionally and actively emits a specific
signal. In this paper, we apply channel charting to passive localization. We
use a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system to estimate a target's velocity
and derive a distance matrix from it. We then use this matrix to learn a
distance-preserving embedding in 2D space, which serves as a fingerprinting
model. In our experiments, we deploy six nodes in a fully connected
ultra-wideband (UWB) mesh network to show that our method achieves high
localization accuracy, with an average error of just 0.24\,m, even when we
train and test on different targets.

Abstract: Improving the fundamental performance trade-off in integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) systems has been deemed as one of the most significant
challenges. To address it, we propose in this letter a novel ISAC system that
leverages an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS) and the UAV's maneuverability in six-dimensional (6D) space,
i.e., three-dimensional (3D) location and 3D rotation, thus referred to as
passive 6D movable antenna (6DMA). We aim to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) for sensing a single target while ensuring a minimum SNR at a
communication user equipment (UE), by jointly optimizing the transmit
beamforming at the ISAC base station (BS), the 3D location and orientation as
well as the reflection coefficients of the IRS. To solve this challenging
non-convex optimization problem, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first
stage, we aim to optimize the IRS's 3D location, 3D orientation, and reflection
coefficients to enhance both the channel correlations and power gains for
sensing and communication. Given their optimized parameters, the optimal
transmit beamforming at the ISAC BS is derived in closed form. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed passive 6DMA-enabled ISAC system
significantly improves the sensing and communication trade-off by
simultaneously enhancing channel correlations and power gains, and outperforms
other baseline schemes.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is defined as one of six usage
scenarios in the ITU-R International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) 2030
framework for 6G. ISAC is envisioned to introduce the sensing capability into
the cellular network, where sensing may be obtained using the cellular radio
frequency (RF) signals with or without additional auxiliary sensors. To enable
ISAC, specification bodies such as European Telecommunications Standards
Institute (ETSI) and Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) have already
started to look into detailed ISAC use cases, their requirements, and the
channel models and evaluation methodologies that are necessary to design and
evaluate ISAC performance. With focus on the channel model, the current
communication-centric channel models like those specified in 3GPP technical
report (TR) 38.901 do not cover the RF signals interactions between the
transmitter, target object, receiver and their surrounding environment. To
bridge this gap, 3GPP has been looking into the basic changes that are
necessary to make to their TR38.901 channel model with focus on selected use
cases from the 3GPP SA1 5G-Advanced feasibility study. In parallel, ETSI ISAC
Industry Specification Group (ISG) has been studying the more advanced ISAC
channel modelling features that are needed to support the variety of ISAC use
cases envisioned in 6G. In this paper, we present the baseline and advanced
features developed thus far in 3GPP and ETSI ISAC ISG, respectively, towards a
comprehensive view of the ISAC channel model in 6G.

### [17] [Ray Antenna Array Achieves Uniform Angular Resolution Cost-Effectively for Low-Altitude UAV Swarm ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10306)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的射线天线阵列（RAA）架构，用于低空无人机群的集成传感与通信（ISAC），通过简单的硬件设计和优化的波束形成，显著提升了性能和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统天线阵列在无人机群ISAC中面临硬件成本高、波束形成增益低和角度分辨率不均匀等问题，RAA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了RAA的射线结构和射线选择网络（RSN），建立了数学模型，并提出了基于OFDM的高效参数估计算法。

Result: RAA在角度分辨率和通信频谱效率上显著优于传统阵列，展现出其在无人机群ISAC中的巨大潜力。

Conclusion: RAA系统能够满足低空无人机群ISAC日益增长的需求，是一种高效且成本低的解决方案。

Abstract: Ray antenna array (RAA) is a novel multi-antenna architecture comprising
massive low-cost antenna elements and a few radio-frequency (RF) chains. The
antenna elements are arranged in a novel ray-like structure, where each ray
corresponds to a simple uniform linear array (sULA) with deliberately designed
orientation and all its antenna elements are directly connected. By further
designing a ray selection network (RSN), appropriate sULAs are selected to
connect to the RF chains for further baseband processing. RAA has three
appealing advantages: (i) dramatically reduced hardware cost since no phase
shifters are needed; (ii) enhanced beamforming gain as antenna elements with
higher directivity can be used; (iii) uniform angular resolution across all
signal directions. Such benefits make RAA especially appealing for integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC), particularly for low-altitude unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) swarm ISAC, where high-mobility aerial targets may easily move
away from the boresight of conventional antenna arrays, causing severe
communication and sensing performance degradation. Therefore, this paper
studies RAA-based ISAC for low-altitude UAV swarm systems. First, we establish
an input-output mathematical model for RAA-based UAV ISAC and rigorously show
that RAA achieves uniform angular resolution for all directions. Besides, we
design the RAA orientation and RSN. Furthermore, RAA-based ISAC with orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for UAV swarm is studied, and efficient
algorithm is proposed for sensing target parameter estimation. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate the significant performance improvement by RAA
system over the conventional antenna arrays, in terms of sensing angular
resolution and communication spectral efficiency, highlighting the great
potential of the novel RAA system to meet the growing demands of low-altitude
UAV ISAC.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索实际系统中模拟自干扰消除（A-SIC）的性能极限，尤其是在多抽头延迟架构（MTD）中，考虑非平稳发送信号、非线性失真、多路径SI信道和抽头权重限制等实际问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为A-SIC的实际性能提供了理论依据和优化方案，简化了性能分析和优化流程。

Abstract: Analog self-interference cancellation (A-SIC) plays a crucial role in the
implementation of in-band full-duplex (IBFD) radios, due to the fact that the
inherent transmit (Tx) noise can only be addressed in the analog domain. It is
thus natural to ask what the performance limit of A-SIC is in practical
systems, which is still quite underexplored so far. In this paper, we aim to
close this gap by characterizing the fundamental performance of A-SIC which
employs the common multi-tap delay (MTD) architecture, by accounting for the
following practical issues: 1) Nonstationarity of the Tx signal; 2) Nonlinear
distortions on the Tx signal; 3) Multipath channel corresponding to the
self-interference (SI); 4) Maximum amplitude constraint on the MTD tap weights.
Our findings include: 1) The average approximation error for the
cyclostationary Tx signals is equal to that for the stationary white Gaussian
process, thus greatly simplifying the performance analysis and the optimization
procedure. 2) The approximation error for the multipath SI channel can be
decomposed as the sum of the approximation error for the single-path scenario.
By leveraging these structural results, the optimization framework and
algorithms which characterize the fundamental limit of A-SIC, by taking into
account all the aforementioned practical factors, are provided.

Result: 非因果优化在所有指标和场景中均优于因果方法，因其能更有效表征目标声源的响应。

Conclusion: 非因果优化为空间选择性主动噪声控制提供了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in active noise control have enabled the development of
hearables with spatial selectivity, which actively suppress undesired noise
while preserving desired sound from specific directions. In this work, we
propose an improved approach to spatially selective active noise control that
incorporates acausal relative impulse responses into the optimization process,
resulting in significantly improved performance over the causal design. We
evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables
with spatially localized speech and noise sources in an anechoic environment.
Performance is evaluated in terms of speech distortion, noise reduction, and
signal-to-noise ratio improvement across different delays and degrees of
acausality. Results show that the proposed acausal optimization consistently
outperforms the causal approach across all metrics and scenarios, as acausal
filters more effectively characterize the response of the desired source.

Abstract: Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual
viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track
two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera
orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents
AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve
visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system
uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines
heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust
camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained
99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$
2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally
efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study
(N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training
task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's
viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's
improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary
camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side
manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new
multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.

Abstract: Graph learning, or network inference, is a prominent problem in graph signal
processing (GSP). GSP generalizes the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean
domains, and graph learning is pivotal to applying GSP when these domains are
unknown. With the recent prevalence of multi-way data, there has been growing
interest in product graphs that naturally factorize dependencies across
different ways. However, the types of graph products that can be learned are
still limited for modeling diverse dependency structures. In this paper, we
study the problem of learning a Kronecker-structured product graph from smooth
signals. Unlike the more commonly used Cartesian product, the Kronecker product
models dependencies in a more intricate, non-separable way, but posits harder
constraints on the graph learning problem. To tackle this non-convex problem,
we propose an alternating scheme to optimize each factor graph and provide
theoretical guarantees for its asymptotic convergence. The proposed algorithm
is also modified to learn factor graphs of the strong product. We conduct
experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate our approach's
efficacy and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Designing a 6G-oriented universal model capable of processing multi-modal

future wireless systems. Building on our prior work in communication
multi-modal alignment and telecom large language model (LLM), we propose a
scalable, task-aware artificial intelligence-air interface multi-modal
universal model (AI2MMUM), which flexibility and effectively perform various
physical layer tasks according to subtle task instructions. The LLM backbone
provides robust contextual comprehension and generalization capabilities, while
a fine-tuning approach is adopted to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To
enhance task adaptability, task instructions consist of fixed task keywords and
learnable, implicit prefix prompts. Frozen radio modality encoders extract
universal representations and adapter layers subsequently bridge radio and
language modalities. Moreover, lightweight task-specific heads are designed to
directly output task objectives. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that
AI2MMUM achieves SOTA performance across five representative physical
environment/wireless channel-based downstream tasks using the WAIR-D and
DeepMIMO datasets.

TL;DR: 该文提出了一种名为Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models的新方法，通过替代标准分数函数来规避传统基于分数的扩散模型在训练过程中需要反转协方差矩阵的问题，从而支持任意高斯噪声过程的稳定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于分数的扩散模型（DMs）在处理各向异性高斯扩散过程时可能因需要反转协方差矩阵而产生困难。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了WS扩散模型。

Method: 作者提出了一种新的SDE框架，学习Whitened Score函数而不是标准分数函数。这种方法绕过了协方差矩阵的反转，使得扩散模型可以在任意高斯前向噪声过程上稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明，WS扩散模型在CIFAR和CelebA（64x64）数据集上的多种计算成像任务中，优于基于各向同性高斯噪声的传统扩散先验。

Conclusion: WS扩散模型不仅扩展了传统扩散模型的能力，还提供了针对结构化噪声成像问题的强贝叶斯先验。

Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance
matrices in the denoising score matching training objective
\cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion
models, a novel SDE-based framework that learns the Whitened Score function
instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion,
extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary
Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with FM for
arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and
provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured
noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the
CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion
priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently
outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Many multi-variate time series obtained in the natural sciences and
engineering possess a repetitive behavior, as for instance state-space
trajectories of industrial machines in discrete automation. Recovering the
times of recurrence from such a multi-variate time series is of a fundamental
importance for many monitoring and control tasks. For a periodic time series
this is equivalent to determining its period length. In this work we present a
persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate
time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic,
repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods
within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using
real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding
machine.

Abstract: In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wake-up radio (WuR)-enabled
internet of things (IoT) networks, UAVs can instantly activate the main radios
(MRs) of the sensor nodes (SNs) with a wake-up call (WuC) for efficient data
collection in mission-driven data collection scenarios. However, the
spontaneous response of numerous SNs to the UAV's WuC can lead to significant
packet loss and collisions, as WuR does not exhibit its superiority for
high-traffic loads. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative
receiver-initiated WuR UAV-assisted clustering (RI-WuR-UAC) medium access
control (MAC) protocol to achieve low latency and high reliability in ultra-low
power consumption applications. We model the proposed protocol using the
$M/G/1/2$ queuing framework and derive expressions for key performance metrics,
i.e., channel busyness probability, probability of successful clustering,
average SN energy consumption, and average transmission delay. The RI-WuR-UAC
protocol employs three distinct data flow models, tailored to different network
traffic conditions, which perform three MAC mechanisms: channel assessment
(CCA) clustering for light traffic loads, backoff plus CCA clustering for dense
and heavy traffic, and adaptive clustering for variable traffic loads.
Simulation results demonstrate that the RI-WuR-UAC protocol significantly
outperforms the benchmark sub-carrier modulation clustering protocol. By
varying the network load, we capture the trade-offs among the performance
metrics, showcasing the superior efficiency and reliability of the RI-WuR-UAC
protocol.

Abstract: To circumvent the high path loss of mmWave propagation and reduce the
hardware cost of massive multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems,
full-dimensional hybrid beamforming is critical in 5G and beyond wireless
communications. Concerning an uplink multi-cell system with a large-scale
uniform planar antenna array, this paper designs an efficient hybrid beamformer
using primitive Kronecker decomposition and dynamic factor allocation, where
the analog beamformer applies to null the inter-cell interference and
simultaneously enhances the desired signals. In contrast, the digital
beamformer mitigates the intra-cell interference using the minimum mean square
error (MMSE) criterion. Then, due to the low accuracy of phase shifters
inherent in the analog beamformer, a low-complexity hybrid beamformer is
developed to slow its adjustment speed. Next, an optimality analysis from a
subspace perspective is performed, and a sufficient condition for optimal
antenna configuration is established. Finally, simulation results demonstrate
that the achievable sum rate of the proposed beamformer approaches that of the
optimal pure digital MMSE scheme, yet with much lower computational complexity
and hardware cost.

Abstract: To decode a short linear block code, ordered statics decoding (OSD) and/or
the $A^*$ decoding are usually considered. Either OSD or the $A^*$ decoding
utilizes the magnitudes of the received symbols to establish the most reliable
and independent positions (MRIP) frame. A restricted searched space can be
employed to achieve near-optimum decoding with reduced decoding complexity. For
a low-rate code with large minimum distance, the restricted search space is
still very huge.
  We propose to use concatenated coding to further restrict the search space by
proposing an improved MRIP frame. The improved MRIP frame is founded according
to magnitudes of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) obtained by the soft-in soft-out
(SISO) decoder for the inner code.
  We focus on the construction and decoding of several $(n,k)$ = (128,36)
binary linear block codes based on concatenated coding. We use the (128,36)
extended BCH (eBCH) code as a benchmark for comparison. Simulation shows that
there exist constructed concatenated codes which are much more efficient than
the (128,36) eBCH code. Some other codes of length 128 or close to 128 are also
constructed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.
