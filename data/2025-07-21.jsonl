However, location and motion\nparameters become inherently coupled in this regime, making their joint\nestimation computationally demanding. To overcome this, we propose a novel\napproach that projects the received two-dimensional space-time signal onto the\nangle-Doppler domain using a two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform\n(2D-DFT). Our analysis reveals that the resulting angular spread is centered at\nthe target's true angle, with its width determined by the target's range.\nSimilarly, transverse motion induces a Doppler spread centered at the true\nradial velocity, with the width of Doppler spread proportional to the\ntransverse velocity. Exploiting these spectral characteristics, we develop a\nlow-complexity algorithm that provides coarse estimates of angle, range, and\nvelocity, which are subsequently refined using one-dimensional multiple signal\nclassification (MUSIC) applied independently to each parameter. The proposed\nmethod enables accurate and efficient estimation of NF target motion\nparameters.

The performance\nof both communication and sensing fundamentally depends on the availability of\naccurate and up-to-date channel state information (CSI). In modern 5G networks,\nuplink CSI is derived from two reference signals: the demodulation reference\nsignal (DMRS) and the sounding reference signal (SRS). However, current base\nstation implementations treat these CSI measurements as separate information\nstreams. The key innovation of CARTS is to fuse these two CSI streams, thereby\nincreasing the frequency of CSI updates and extending sensing opportunities to\nmore users. CARTS addresses two key challenges: (i) a novel channel stitching\nand compensation method that integrates asynchronous CSI estimates from DMRS\nand SRS, despite their different time and frequency allocations, and (ii) a\nreal-time SRS triggering algorithm that complements the inherently\nuncontrollable DMRS schedule, ensuring sufficient and non-redundant sensing\nopportunities for all users. Our trace-driven evaluation shows that CARTS\nsignificantly improves scalability, achieving a channel estimation error (NMSE)\nof 0.167 and UE tracking accuracy of 85 cm while supporting twice the number of\nusers as a periodic SRS-only baseline with similar performance.
