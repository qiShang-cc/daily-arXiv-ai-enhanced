### [1] [Integrated Image Reconstruction and Target Recognition based on Deep Learning Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04836)
*Cien Zhang,Jiaming Zhang,Jiajun He,Okan Yurduseven*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Att-ClassiGAN的方法，通过结合注意力门模块改进ClassiGAN，提升了计算微波成像的图像重建和目标分类性能，显著减少重建时间并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微波成像技术存在硬件密集和数据采集速度慢等问题，计算微波成像(CMI)虽能缓解这些问题，但在图像重建阶段仍面临计算瓶颈。研究旨在通过改进ClassiGAN模型，优化特征提取和目标分类。

Method: 在ClassiGAN基础上引入注意力门模块，动态聚焦重要特征并抑制无关信息，从而提升模型性能。改进后的模型称为Att-ClassiGAN。

Result: Att-ClassiGAN显著减少了重建时间，在归一化均方误差(NMSE)、结构相似性指数(SSIM)和分类效果上优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入注意力机制，Att-ClassiGAN有效提升了计算微波成像的性能，为图像重建和目标分类提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational microwave imaging (CMI) has gained attention as an alternative
technique for conventional microwave imaging techniques, addressing their
limitations such as hardware-intensive physical layer and slow data collection
acquisition speed to name a few. Despite these advantages, CMI still encounters
notable computational bottlenecks, especially during the image reconstruction
stage. In this setting, both image recovery and object classification present
significant processing demands. To address these challenges, our previous work
introduced ClassiGAN, which is a generative deep learning model designed to
simultaneously reconstruct images and classify targets using only
back-scattered signals. In this study, we build upon that framework by
incorporating attention gate modules into ClassiGAN. These modules are intended
to refine feature extraction and improve the identification of relevant
information. By dynamically focusing on important features and suppressing
irrelevant ones, the attention mechanism enhances the overall model
performance. The proposed architecture, named Att-ClassiGAN, significantly
reduces the reconstruction time compared to traditional CMI approaches.
Furthermore, it outperforms current advanced methods, delivering improved
Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), higher Structural Similarity Index
(SSIM), and better classification outcomes for the reconstructed targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用模拟计算的高效性和RIS的可重构性，探索在无线传播环境中实现神经网络计算的可能性，以提升频谱效率和计算速度。

Method: 通过分布式RIS设计Air-ODE网络，利用波反射物理特性和RIS的可调相位实现模拟域的ODE块，应用于DeepSC系统实现双重任务（图像重建和语义标注）。

Conclusion: Air-ODE网络展示了模拟计算在无线环境中的潜力，高效支持复杂任务，为下一代通信系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Analog machine-learning hardware platforms promise greater speed and energy
efficiency than their digital counterparts. Specifically, over-the-air analog
computation allows offloading computation to the wireless propagation through
carefully constructed transmitted signals. In addition, reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) is emerging as a promising solution for
next-generation wireless networks, offering the ability to tailor the
communication environment. Leveraging the advantages of RIS, we design and
implement the ordinary differential equation (ODE) neural network using
over-the-air computation (AirComp) and demonstrate its effectiveness for dual
tasks. We engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment through
distributed RISs to create an architecture termed the over-the-air ordinary
differential equation (Air-ODE) network. Unlike the conventional digital
ODE-inspired neural network, the Air-ODE block utilizes the physics of wave
reflection and the reconfigurable phase shifts of RISs to implement an ODE
block in the analog domain, enhancing spectrum efficiency. Moreover, the
advantages of Air-ODE are demonstrated in a deep learning-based semantic
communication (DeepSC) system by extracting effective semantic information to
reduce the data transmission load, while achieving the dual functions of image
reconstruction and semantic tagging simultaneously at the receiver. Simulation
results show that the analog Air-ODE network can achieve similar performance to
the digital ODE-inspired network. Specifically, for the image reconstruction
and semantic tagging task, compared with the analog network without the Air-ODE
block, the Air-ODE block can achieve around 2 times gain in both reconstruction
quality and tagging accuracy.

### [4] [Experiment Study on Reference-Path-Aided System Calibration for mmWave Bistatic ISAC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05003)
*Chenhao Luo,Chongrui Wang,Aimin Tang,Fei Gao,Chaojun Xu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对毫米波双基地ISAC系统的参考路径辅助系统校准方案，解决了通信同步中的系统误差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双基地ISAC在消除自干扰方面具有优势，但通信同步导致的系统误差会严重影响感知性能，因此需要一种有效的校准方法。

Method: 通过利用毫米波ISAC系统的延迟-角度稀疏特性，识别参考路径并利用其参数补偿其他路径的系统误差。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方案能支持精确的多普勒频移和延迟估计，时间同步误差控制在1纳秒以内。

Conclusion: 参考路径辅助校准方案能有效解决双基地ISAC系统的同步问题，提升感知性能。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been regarded as a key
enabling technology for next-generation wireless networks. Compared to
monostatic ISAC, bistatic ISAC can eliminate the critical challenge of
self-interference cancellation and is well compatible with the existing network
infrastructures. However, the synchronization between the transmitter and the
sensing receiver becomes a crucial problem. The extracted channel state
information (CSI) for sensing under communication synchronization contains
different types of system errors, such as the sampling time offset (STO),
carrier frequency offset (CFO), and random phase shift, which can severely
degrade sensing performance or even render sensing infeasible. To address this
problem, a reference-path-aided system calibration scheme is designed for
mmWave bistatic ISAC systems, where the line-of-sight (LoS) path can be
blocked. By exploiting the delay-angle sparsity feature in mmWave ISAC systems,
the reference path, which can be either a LoS or a non-LoS (NLoS) path, is
first identified. By leveraging the fact that all the paths suffer the same
system errors, the channel parameter extracted from the reference path is
utilized to compensate for the system errors in all other paths. A mmWave ISAC
system is developed to validate our design. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed scheme can support precise estimation of Doppler shift and
delay, maintaining time-synchronization errors within 1 nanosecond.

Abstract: Multi-frequency massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication is a
promising strategy for both 5G and future 6G systems, ensuring reliable
transmission while enhancing frequency resource utilization. Statistical
channel state information (CSI) has been widely adopted in multi-frequency
massive MIMO transmissions to reduce overhead and improve transmission
performance. In this paper, we propose efficient and accurate methods for
obtaining statistical CSI in multi-frequency massive MIMO systems. First, we
introduce a multi-frequency massive MIMO channel model and analyze the mapping
relationship between two types of statistical CSI, namely the angular power
spectrum (APS) and the spatial covariance matrix, along with their correlation
across different frequency bands. Next, we propose an autoregressive (AR)
method to predict the spatial covariance matrix of any frequency band based on
that of another frequency band. Furthermore, we emphasize that channels across
different frequency bands share similar APS characteristics. Leveraging the
maximum entropy (ME) criterion, we develop a low-complexity algorithm for
high-resolution APS estimation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
of the AR-based covariance prediction method and demonstrate the
high-resolution estimation capability of the ME-based approach. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-frequency cooperative transmission by
applying the proposed methods to obtain statistical CSI from low-frequency
bands and utilizing it for high-frequency channel transmission. This approach
significantly enhances high-frequency transmission performance while
effectively reducing system overhead.

Abstract: Sustainable energy supply and high-speed communications are two significant
needs for mobile electronic devices. This paper introduces a self-aligning
resonant beam system for simultaneous light information and power transfer
(SLIPT), employing a novel coupled spatially distributed resonator (CSDR). The
system utilizes a resonant beam for efficient power delivery and a
second-harmonic beam for concurrent data transmission, inherently minimizing
echo interference and enabling bidirectional communication. Through
comprehensive analyses, we investigate the CSDR's stable region, beam
evolution, and power characteristics in relation to working distance and device
parameters. Numerical simulations validate the CSDR-SLIPT system's feasibility
by identifying a stable beam waist location for achieving accurate mode-match
coupling between two spatially distributed resonant cavities and demonstrating
its operational range and efficient power delivery across varying distances.
The research reveals the system's benefits in terms of both safety and energy
transmission efficiency. We also demonstrate the trade-off among the
reflectivities of the cavity mirrors in the CSDR. These findings offer valuable
design insights for resonant beam systems, advancing SLIPT with significant
potential for remote device connectivity.

### [8] [Temperature-Resilient LC-RIS Phase-Shift Design for Multi-user Downlink Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05160)
*Nairy Moghadas Gholian,Mohamadreza Delbari,Vahid Jamali,Arash Asadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了温度对液晶可重构智能表面（LC-RIS）性能的影响，并提出了一种温度弹性相位偏移设计，通过优化算法在多用户毫米波网络中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于半导体的可重构智能表面（RIS）在毫米波/亚太赫兹频段功耗和成本高，而液晶（LC）技术可降低成本与功耗。然而液晶分子对温度敏感，需设计温度弹性方案以适应不同地理环境。

Method: 论文通过建立考虑温度影响的LC-RIS相位偏移模型，提出了一种针对多用户下行毫米波网络的最大-最小信号干扰加噪声比（SINR）优化算法。

Result: 仿真结果显示，相比忽略温度效应的基线方法，该算法在给定参数下显著提升了系统性能。

Conclusion: 通过温度弹性设计，LC-RIS在降低功耗与成本的同时，能有效应对温度变化对相位偏移的负面影响。

Abstract: The reflecting antenna elements in most reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs) use semiconductor-based (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes
and varactors) phase shifters. Although effective, a drawback of this
technology is the high power consumption and cost, which become particularly
prohibitive in millimeter-wave (mmWave)/sub-Terahertz range. With the advances
in Liquid Crystals (LCs) in microwave engineering, we have observed a new trend
in using LC for realizing phase shifter networks of RISs. LC-RISs are expected
to significantly reduce the fabrication costs and power consumption. However,
the nematic LC molecules are sensitive to temperature variations. Therefore,
implementing LC-RIS in geographical regions with varying temperatures requires
temperature-resilient designs. The mentioned temperature variation issue
becomes more significant at higher temperatures as the phase shifter range
reduces in warmer conditions, whereas it expands in cooler ones. In this paper,
we study the impact of temperature on the operation of LC-RISs and develop a
temperature-resilient phase shift design. Specifically, we formulate a max-min
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio optimization for a multi-user downlink
mmWave network that accounts for the impact of temperature in the LC-RIS phase
shifts. The simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement for the
considered set of parameters when using our algorithm compared to the baseline
approach, which neglects the temperature effects.

### [9] [From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated Sleep Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05371)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了自动化睡眠分析的可行性，结合了睡眠阶段划分和睡眠纺锤体检测，验证了其在双相情感障碍研究中的有效性。自动分析重现了专家研究的关键发现，显著提高了效率，并开源了工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化睡眠分析可以大规模研究并减少人为误差，但目前多步骤自动分析的可行性尚不明确。论文旨在验证自动化方法是否能复现专家研究的结果。

Method: 使用RobustSleepNet进行睡眠阶段划分，SUMOv2检测睡眠纺锤体，完全自动化分析双相情感障碍患者的睡眠数据。

Result: 自动分析重现了专家研究的关键发现（如纺锤体密度差异），效率大幅提升（分钟 vs. 月），模型性能达到或超过人工评分一致性。

Conclusion: 自动化方法有潜力推动大规模睡眠研究，论文开源了工具并推出了隐私保护的睡眠分析平台SomnoBot。

Abstract: Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages)
and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable
large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater
incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle
detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating
multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully
automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep
staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can
replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The
automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based
study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between
bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously
took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis
differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases
between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually
performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle
detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the
potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public
access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and
introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.

### [10] [Chirp-Based Aliasing Analysis of Arrays in the Spherical Wavefront Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05378)
*Gilles Monnoyer,Laurence Defraigne,Baptiste Sambon,Jérôme Louveaux,Luc Vandendorpe*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于啁啾的球形波前区域(SWR)导向向量新解释，建立了接收或发射信号的空间频谱与阵列及源或目标几何之间的关系，分析了有限天线数量带来的空间采样混叠效应及其对模糊函数(AF)的退化影响，并将方法应用于圆形阵列和均匀线性阵列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于传统欧几里得原则下的天线阵列波传播模型可能不适用于球形波前区域，需要新的理论框架来分析非空间不变的混叠效应及其对信号处理性能的影响。

Method: 论文利用采样定理分析了有限天线数量导致的空间采样混叠效应，提出了一个通用框架来理解这些效应对模糊函数的退化机制，并将框架具体应用于圆形和均匀线性阵列结构。

Result: 研究结果表明，该方法能够提供几何视角下混叠效应的深刻理解，尤其是在近场条件下的非空间不变混叠机制。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的啁啾导向向量解释能够有效分析SWR下的混叠效应，为天线阵列设计与性能评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: In antenna arrays, wave propagation modeling based on Euclidean principles is
typically represented by steering vectors or signals. This paper provides a
new, chirp-based, interpretation of steering vectors in the Spherical Wavefront
Regime (SWR), establishing a relationship between the spatial spectrum of the
received (resp. transmitted) signal and the geometry of the array and the
source (resp. target). Leveraging the well-known sampling theorem, we analyze
aliasing effects arising from spatial sampling with a finite number of antennas
and understand how these effects degrade the Ambiguity Function (AF). Our
framework provides geometric insight into these degradations, offering a deeper
understanding of the non-space-invariant aliasing mechanisms in the SWR. The
proposed approach is formulated for general antenna arrays and then
instantiated to Circular Array and to Uniform Linear Array structures operating
in Near Field conditions.

Motivation: 虽然已知ApoE基因变异与脂质代谢和神经退行性疾病相关，但其对呼吸功能的影响尚不明确。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过体积描记术（PLETH）数据，分析两种ApoE基因型大鼠的呼吸波形特征和熵统计，并研究叹气对呼吸指标的瞬态影响。

Result: 发现两种基因型在活动和静息状态下的呼吸指标（如近似熵）存在显著差异，且叹气会短暂改变后续呼吸的熵值和其他指标。

Conclusion: ApoE基因型差异显著影响呼吸模式，叹气对呼吸动态有短暂调节作用，这可能为研究基因与呼吸功能的关联提供新视角。

Abstract: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene variations are involved in lipid metabolism and
cholesterol transport, with the ApoE4 allele being a known risk factor
associated with neurodegenerative conditions later in life. Emerging evidence
suggests these genetic variations may also influence respiratory function and
vitality. However, the specific impact of different ApoE genotypes on breathing
patterns remains largely unexplored. This work investigates differences in
breathing waveform characteristics and entropy statistics derived from
plethysmography (PLETH) data between rat models possessing two distinct ApoE
genotypes (referred to herein as gene59 and gene95). Findings reveal
significant distributional differences in common plethysmography metrics and
approximate entropy between the two genotypes, observed during both active and
resting states. Additionally, the study examines the transient impact of sighs
(deep breaths) on these breathing metrics, demonstrating that entropy and other
measures are altered in the breaths immediately following a sigh.

### [12] [On the Multiangle Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05388)
*Christian Oswald,Franz Pernkopf*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效计算标准离散分数傅里叶变换（DFRFT）的方法，称为多角度DFRFT（MA-DFRFT），并通过形式化对称性减少了所需的FFT数量，适用于资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多角度中心离散分数傅里叶变换（MA-CDFRFT）仅适用于中心离散分数傅里叶变换（CDFRFT），限制了其应用范围。本文旨在扩展MA-CDFRFT以支持标准DFRFT，并优化计算效率。

Method: 通过简单调整MA-CDFRFT，提出多角度DFRFT（MA-DFRFT），并形式化其对称性以减少计算所需的FFT数量。

Result: 成功实现了标准DFRFT的高效计算，并通过对称性优化将FFT数量减半。

Conclusion: MA-DFRFT为资源受限环境下的时频分析提供了高效工具，扩展了MA-CDFRFT的应用范围。

Abstract: The efficiently computed multiangle centered discrete fractional Fourier
transform (MA-CDFRFT) [1] has proven as a useful tool for time-frequency
analysis; however, its scope is limited to the centered discrete fractional
Fourier transform (CDFRFT). Meanwhile, extensive research on the standard DFRFT
has lead to a better understanding of this transform as well as numerous
possible choices for eigenvectors for implementation. In this letter we present
a simple adaptation of the MA-CDFRFT which allows us to efficiently compute its
standard counterpart, which we call the multiangle DFRFT (MA-DFRFT).
Furthermore, we formalize the symmetries inherent to the MA-CDFRFT and MA-DFRFT
to halve the number of FFTs needed to compute these transforms, paving the way
for applications in resource constrained environments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了6DMA增强的THz网络，通过控制天线位置和旋转实现多用户支持，提出了一种混合场THz信道模型和低开销信道估计算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: THz网络中的6DMA系统因其短波长和大移动范围导致近远场混合问题，且信道估计复杂度高。需解决这些问题以提升网络性能。

Method: 提出混合场广义6DMA THz信道模型，结合平面波和球面波传播，并利用方向稀疏性设计低复杂度信道估计算法。

Result: 数值结果表明，混合场模型接近真实近场模型的性能，信道估计算法实现了低复杂度下的高准确性。

Conclusion: 混合场模型和低开销算法有效解决了6DMA THz网络中的信道建模与估计问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In this work, we study a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-enhanced
Terahertz (THz) network that supports a large number of users with a few
antennas by controlling the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations
of antenna surfaces/subarrays at the base station (BS). However, the short
wavelength of THz signals combined with a large 6DMA movement range extends the
near-field region. As a result, a user can be in the far-field region relative
to the antennas on one 6DMA surface, while simultaneously residing in the
near-field region relative to other 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, 6DMA THz channel
estimation suffers from increased computational complexity and pilot overhead
due to uneven power distribution across the large number of candidate
position-rotation pairs, as well as the limited number of radio frequency (RF)
chains in THz bands. To address these issues, we propose an efficient
hybrid-field generalized 6DMA THz channel model, which accounts for planar wave
propagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical waves among different
6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, we propose a low-overhead channel estimation
algorithm that leverages directional sparsity to construct a complete channel
map for all potential antenna position-rotation pairs.
  Numerical results show that the proposed hybrid-field channel model achieves
a sum rate close to that of the ground-truth near-field channel model and
confirm that the channel estimation method yields accurate results with low
complexity.

Abstract: Integrating VLC with the RIS significantly enhances physical layer security
by enabling precise directional signal control and dynamic adaptation to the
communication environment. These capabilities strengthen the confidentiality
and security of VLC systems. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
joint optimization of VLC AP power allocation, RIS association, and RIS
elements orientation angles for secure VLC systems, while considering RSMA and
power-domain NOMA schemes. Specifically, two frameworks are proposed to
maximize both the minimum secrecy rate (SR) and the minimum secrecy energy
efficiency (SEE) by jointly optimizing power allocation, RIS association, and
RIS elements orientation angles for both power-domain NOMA and RSMA-based VLC
systems. The proposed frameworks consider random device orientation and
guarantee the minimum user-rate requirement. The proposed optimization
frameworks belong to the class of mixed integer nonlinear programming, which
has no known feasible solution methodology to guarantee the optimal solution.
Moreover, the increased degree of freedom and flexibility from the joint
consideration of power control, RIS association and element orientation results
in a large set of decision variables and constraints, which further complicates
the optimization problem. To that end, we utilize a genetic algorithm-based
solution method, which through its exploration and exploitation capabilities
can obtain a good quality solution. Additionally, comprehensive simulations
show that the RSMA scheme outperforms the power-domain NOMA scheme across both
the SR and SEE metrics over various network parameters. Furthermore, useful

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer enhanced spatial diversity for
next-generation wireless systems. However, acquiring accurate channel state
information (CSI) remains challenging due to the large number of reconfigurable
ports and the limited availability of radio-frequency (RF) chains --
particularly in high-dimensional FAS scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose an efficient posterior sampling-based channel estimator that leverages
a diffusion model (DM) with a simplified U-Net architecture to capture the
spatial correlation structure of two-dimensional FAS channels. The DM is
initially trained offline in an unsupervised way and then applied online as a
learned implicit prior to reconstruct CSI from partial observations via
posterior sampling through a denoising diffusion restoration model (DDRM). To
accelerate the online inference, we introduce a skipped sampling strategy that
updates only a subset of latent variables during the sampling process, thereby
reducing the computational cost with minimal accuracy degradation. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher
estimation accuracy and over 20x speedup compared to state-of-the-art
compressed sensing-based methods, highlighting its potential for practical
deployment in high-dimensional FAS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时频相移导频（TFPSPs）的大规模MIMO-OFDM系统信道获取方法，通过三重波束（TB）域信道张量模型和低复杂度张量信息几何方法（IGA）优化信道估计，显著降低了均方误差（NMSE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的信道获取方法在大规模MIMO-OFDM系统中面临高复杂性和导频开销大的问题，因此需要一种能高效抑制用户间干扰并降低复杂度的新方法。

Method: 首先建立TB域信道张量模型，设计时频相移导频（TFPSPs）并优化其调度算法；随后提出基于张量的信息几何方法（IGA）进行信道估计，并简化其实现复杂度。

Result: 仿真显示，该方法能有效降低NMSE超过8 dB，显著提升信道估计性能，尤其在用户数量多的场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: 所提出的TFPSP方法在低复杂度和有限导频开销下显著提升了信道获取效率，为大规模MIMO-OFDM系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a channel acquisition approach with time-frequency
phase-shifted pilots (TFPSPs) for massive multi-input multi-output orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We first present a
triple-beam (TB) based channel tensor model, allowing for the representation of
the space-frequency-time (SFT) domain channel as the product of beam matrices
and the TB domain channel tensor. By leveraging the specific characteristics of
TB domain channels, we develop TFPSPs, where distinct pilot signals are
simultaneously transmitted in the frequency and time domains. Then, we present
the optimal TFPSP design and provide the corresponding pilot scheduling
algorithm. Further, we propose a tensor-based information geometry approach
(IGA) to estimate the TB domain channel tensors. Leveraging the specific
structure of beam matrices and the properties of TFPSPs, we propose a
low-complexity implementation of the tensor-based IGA. We validate the
efficiency of our proposed channel acquisition approach through extensive
simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our
approach. The proposed approach can effectively suppress inter-UT interference
with low complexity and limited pilot overhead, thereby enhancing channel
estimation performance. Particularly in scenarios with a large number of UTs,
the channel acquisition method outperforms existing approaches by reducing the
normalized mean square error (NMSE) by more than 8 dB.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出一种分散式基带处理架构（DBP），用于优化流体天线系统（FAS）的位置和波束成形，解决了大规模FA计算成本高的问题，通过并行处理显著降低计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体天线系统（FAS）为无线通信提供了前所未有的自由度，但优化FA位置计算成本高，尤其是在大规模FA时。如何高效优化FA位置和波束成形成为关键挑战。

Method: 引入分散式基带处理架构（DBP），将FA阵列分簇并行处理，提出基于块坐标上升（BCA）的分布式算法，结合矩阵分数规划（FP）和主要化最小化（MM）方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，DBP架构下的算法比集中式架构节省70%以上的计算时间，且加权和速率（WSR）性能损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: DBP架构和提出的分布式算法显著降低了计算和通信成本，释放了FAS的潜力，为大规模FA系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a disruptive technology,
offering unprecedented degrees of freedom (DoF) for wireless communication
systems. However, optimizing fluid antenna (FA) positions entails significant
computational costs, especially when the number of FAs is large. To address
this challenge, we introduce a decentralized baseband processing (DBP)
architecture to FAS, which partitions the FA array into clusters and enables
parallel processing. Based on the DBP architecture, we formulate a weighted sum
rate (WSR) maximization problem through joint beamforming and FA position
design for FA-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)
systems. To solve the WSR maximization problem, we propose a novel
decentralized block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based algorithm that leverages
matrix fractional programming (FP) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods.
The proposed decentralized algorithm achieves low computational, communication,
and storage costs, thus unleashing the potential of the DBP architecture.
Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm under the DBP architecture
reduces computational time by over 70% compared to centralized architectures
with negligible WSR performance loss.

TL;DR: 本文研究了近场多用户多输入单输出（MU-MISO）场景中的安全传输，提出了结合人工噪声的近场动态混合波束赋形架构，利用近场球面波特性的独特性质，在角度和距离维度上实现安全传输，性能优于传统方法。

Motivation: 随着下一代无线网络中天线孔径和传输频率的增加，近场通信（NFC）的研究变得至关重要。本文旨在利用近场信道中增强的空间自由度，设计安全通信方案。

Abstract: The increase in antenna apertures and transmission frequencies in
next-generation wireless networks is catalyzing advancements in near-field
communications (NFC). In this paper, we investigate secure transmission in
near-field multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenarios.
Specifically, with the advent of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA)
applied in the NFC regime, the spatial degrees of freedom in the channel matrix
are significantly enhanced. This creates an expanded null space that can be
exploited for designing secure communication schemes. Motivated by this
observation, we propose a near-field dynamic hybrid beamforming architecture
incorporating artificial noise, which effectively disrupts eavesdroppers at any
undesired positions, even in the absence of their channel state information
(CSI). Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the dynamic precoder's
performance in terms of the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio,
achievable rate, secrecy capacity, secrecy outage probability, and the size of
the secrecy zone. In contrast to far-field secure transmission techniques that
only enhance security in the angular dimension, the proposed algorithm exploits
the unique properties of spherical wave characteristics in NFC to achieve
secure transmission in both the angular and distance dimensions. Remarkably,
the proposed algorithm is applicable to arbitrary modulation types and array
configurations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
approximately 20\% higher rate capacity compared to zero-forcing and the
weighted minimum mean squared error precoders.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了极端天气和云层覆盖对Starlink Flat High Performance (FHP)终端在芬兰奥卢性能的影响，发现降雨显著降低上下行吞吐量，而云层覆盖与吞吐量呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Starlink FHP终端在极端天气下的性能缺乏详细分析，作者旨在填补这一空白，探究天气对其吞吐量的影响。

Method: 在靠近北极圈的奥卢进行实测，分析降雨和云层覆盖对上下行吞吐量及往返时间的影响，并使用线性回归检验云层与吞吐量的关系。

Result: 降雨使上下行吞吐量中位数分别下降52.27%和37.84%，但对往返时间无显著影响；云层覆盖达87.5%时，吞吐量比12.5%云层时低约20%。

Conclusion: 天气条件（尤其是降雨和云层）显著影响Starlink FHP性能，需在设计和服务部署中予以考虑。

Abstract: Satellite communications have emerged as one of the most feasible solutions
to provide global wireless coverage and connect the unconnected. Starlink
dominates the market with over 7,000 operational satellites in low Earth orbit
(LEO) and offers global high-speed and low-latency Internet service for
stationary and mobile use cases, including in-motion connectivity for vehicles,
vessels, and aircraft. Starlink terminals are designed to handle extreme
weather conditions. Starlink recommends a flat high performance (FHP) terminal
for users living in areas with extreme weather conditions. The earlier studies
evaluated Starlink's FHP throughput for stationary and in-motion users without
providing a detailed analysis of how weather affects its performance. There
remains a need to investigate the impact of weather on FHP's throughput. In
this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing the impact of weather on
Starlink's performance in Oulu, Finland, a city located in Northern Europe near
the Arctic Circle. Our measurements reveal that rain degrades median uplink and
downlink throughput by 52.27% and 37.84%, respectively. On the contrary, there
was no noticeable impact on the round-trip time. Additionally, we also examine
the impact of cloud cover on the Starlink throughput. The linear regression
analysis reveals the negative relationship between throughput and cloud cover.
The cloud cover of up to 12.5% has around 20% greater throughput than the cloud
cover of 87.5%

Abstract: The sixth generation of wireless networks defined several key performance
indicators (KPIs) for assessing its networks, mainly in terms of reliability,
coverage, and sensing. In this regard, remarkable attention has been paid
recently to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm as an
enabler for efficiently and jointly performing communication and sensing using
the same spectrum and hardware resources. On the other hand, ensuring
communication and data security has been an imperative requirement for wireless
networks throughout their evolution. The physical-layer security (PLS) concept
paved the way to catering to the security needs in wireless networks in a
sustainable way while guaranteeing theoretically secure transmissions,
independently of the computational capacity of adversaries. Therefore, it is of
paramount importance to consider a balanced trade-off between communication
reliability, sensing, and security in future networks, such as the 5G and
beyond, and the 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and system-wise
review of designed secure ISAC systems from a PLS point of view. In particular,
the impact of various physical-layer techniques, schemes, and wireless
technologies to ensure the sensing-security trade-off is studied from the
surveyed work. Furthermore, the amalgamation of PLS and ISAC is analyzed in a
broader impact by considering attacks targeting data confidentiality,
communication covertness, and sensing spoofing. The paper also serves as a
tutorial by presenting several theoretical foundations on ISAC and PLS, which
represent a practical guide for readers to develop novel secure ISAC network
designs.
