Consequently, the channel\nreciprocity assumption no longer holds. The DRIS not only jams the covert\ntransmissions between Alice and Bob, but also decreases the error probabilities\nof Willie's detections, without either Bob's channel knowledge or additional\njamming power. To quantify the impact of the DRIS on covert communications, we\nfirst design a detection rule for the warden Willie in the presence of\ntime-varying FPJ introduced by the DRIS. Then, we define the detection error\nprobabilities, i.e., the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate\n(MDR), as the monitoring performance metrics for Willie's detections, and the\nsignal-to-jamming-plusnoise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric\nfor the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob.

However, their feasibility depends on the\navailability of custom-designed high-speed, tiny, ultra-efficient transceivers.\nThis represents a challenge due to the tradeoffs between bandwidth, area, and\nenergy efficiency that are found as frequency increases, which suggests that\nthere is an optimal frequency region. To aid in the search for such an optimal\ndesign point, this paper presents a behavioral model that quantifies the\nexpected power consumption of oscillators, mixers, and power amplifiers as a\nfunction of frequency. The model is built on extensive surveys of the\nrespective sub-blocks, all based on experimental data. By putting together the\nmodels of the three sub-blocks, a comprehensive power model is obtained, which\nwill aid in selecting the optimal operating frequency for WNoC systems."}
