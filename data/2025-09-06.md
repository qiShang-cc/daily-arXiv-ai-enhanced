### [1] [Multi-Sensor Fusion for Extended Object Tracking Exploiting Active and Passive Radio Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03686)
*Hong Zhu,Alexander Venus,Erik Leitinger,Klaus Witrisal*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种贝叶斯方法，融合主动和被动测量，用于在LOS被部分遮挡的场景中实现精确定位，并提出了一种适用于人体代理的扩展对象模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线电设备的精确定位因多径传播、硬件损伤和其他干扰而具有挑战性，尤其是当代理（如用户）部分遮挡LOS时。

Method: 提出贝叶斯方法融合主动和被动测量，开发多传感器PDA算法处理测量来源不确定性，并设计适用于人体的扩展对象模型。

Result: 在合成和真实无线电测量中，该方法在OLOS条件下优于基于点目标假设的传统PDA方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效应对LOS被遮挡情况，提升定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reliable and robust positioning of radio devices remains a challenging task
due to multipath propagation, hardware impairments, and interference from other
radio transmitters. A frequently overlooked but critical factor is the agent
itself, e.g., the user carrying the device, which potentially obstructs
line-of-sight (LOS) links to the base stations (anchors). This paper addresses
the problem of accurate positioning in scenarios where LOS links are partially
blocked by the agent. The agent is modeled as an extended object (EO) that
scatters, attenuates, and blocks radio signals. We propose a Bayesian method
that fuses ``active'' measurements (between device and anchors) with
``passive'' multistatic radar-type measurements (between anchors, reflected by
the EO). To handle measurement origin uncertainty, we introduce an multi-sensor
and multiple-measurement probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm that
jointly fuses all EO-related measurements. Furthermore, we develop an EO model
tailored to agents such as human users, accounting for multiple reflections
scattered off the body surface, and propose a simplified variant for
low-complexity implementation. Evaluation on both synthetic and real radio
measurements demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional
PDA methods based on point target assumptions, particularly during and after
obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) conditions.

### [2] [Sensor placement for sparse force reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03825)
*Jeunghoon Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Gram矩阵的传感器布局策略，用于频域稀疏力重建，通过模态分解揭示其结构由目标频率附近的少数模式主导，并通过贪婪算法优化传感器位置以减少Gram矩阵的非对角能量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是通过优化传感器布局，减少频响函数矩阵的相干性，从而提高稀疏力重建的准确性。

Method: 采用Gram矩阵模态分解和贪婪算法，选择能够最小化Gram矩阵非对角能量的传感器位置。

Result: 数值模拟和实验验证表明，该方法在力估计方面优于启发式传感器布局，具有更高的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的Gram矩阵方法为传感器布局提供了一种高效且实用的设计框架，显著提升了稀疏力重建的性能。

Abstract: The present study proposes a Gram-matrix-based sensor placement strategy for
sparse force reconstruction in the frequency domain. A modal decomposition of
the Gram matrix reveals that its structure is dominated by a few modes near the
target frequency, and that each modal contribution reflects the spatial
correlation of the corresponding mode shape. This suggests that placing sensors
near nodal regions where spatial correlation is low can reduce coherence in the
frequency response function (FRF) matrix and improve force reconstruction
accuracy. To translate the physical insight into a practical design framework,
a greedy algorithm is proposed to select sensor locations that minimize the
off-diagonal energy of the Gram matrix. Numerical simulations and experimental
validations demonstrate that the proposed method yields robust and accurate
force estimation, outperforming heuristic sensor layouts.

### [3] [A Low-Cost Open-Source BLE-Based Asian Hornet Tracking System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03979)
*Gilles Callebaut,Jan Van Moer*

Main category: eess.SP

Method: 系统由轻量级BLE标签和GNU Radio实现的软件定义无线电接收器组成，利用Yagi天线和PlutoSDR进行数字波束扫描确定标签方向。

Result: 野外测试显示系统在50米内具有可靠的角分辨率，通信范围可达360米。

Conclusion: 该系统为黄蜂追踪和环境监测提供了可扩展的开源框架。

Abstract: The Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) poses a serious threat to ecosystems and
beekeeping. Locating nests is essential, but usually involves time-consuming
manual triangulation. We present a low-cost, open-source tracking system based
on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The system consists of a lightweight BLE tag and
a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented in GNU Radio. By bypassing
the BLE stack, we embed a custom pseudo-noise (PN) sequence in the uncoded PHY
for correlation-based detection. Using a Yagi antenna and PlutoSDR, the
receiver performs digital beam sweeping to determine the tag's direction. Field
tests show reliable angular resolution at 50m and a communication range up to
360m. While our modulation increases receiver complexity, it enables future
improvements such as multichannel spreading and tag identification. The design
is fully open-source and provides a scalable framework for hornet tracking and
related applications in environmental monitoring.

### [4] [Approximate Message Passing for Multi-Preamble Detection in OTFS Random Access](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03980)
*Alessandro Mirri,Vishnu Teja Kunde,Enrico Paolini,Jean-Francois Chamberland*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决正交时频空间（OTFS）信号系统中的多前导检测问题，优化检测性能。

Method: 设计了一种新型AMP算法，强制双稀疏性（前导稀疏选择和OTFS信号的延迟-多普勒域稀疏性），并推导了非可分离复杂稀疏约束下的AMP去噪器。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法实现了稳健的检测性能，并显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在多前导检测任务中表现出色，为OTFS系统的随机接入提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This article addresses the problem of multiple preamble detection in random
access systems based on orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signaling. This
challenge is formulated as a structured sparse recovery problem in the complex
domain. To tackle it, the authors propose a new approximate message passing
(AMP) algorithm that enforces double sparsity: the sparse selection of
preambles and the inherent sparsity of OTFS signals in the delay-Doppler
domain. From an algorithmic standpoint, the non-separable complex sparsity
constraint necessitates a careful derivation and leads to the design of a novel
AMP denoiser. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
robust detection performance and delivers significant gains over
state-of-the-art techniques.

### [5] [Joint Frequency-Space Sparse Reconstruction for DOA Estimation under Coherent Sources and Amplitude-Phase Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03983)
*Yutong Chen,Cong Zhou,Changsheng You,Shuo Shi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合频域和空间稀疏重构方法，用于解决相干源和阵列幅度相位误差下的DOA估计问题，计算复杂度低且估计精度高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法比基准方案具有更高的估计精度。

Conclusion: 该方法无需迭代优化，计算复杂度低，适用于相干源的DOA估计。

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a joint frequency-space sparse reconstruction
method for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, which effectively addresses
the issues arising from the existence of coherent sources and array
amplitude-phase errors. Specifically, by using an auxiliary source with known
angles, we first construct the real steering vectors (RSVs) based on the
spectral peaks of received signals in the frequency domain, which serve as a
complete basis matrix for compensation for amplitude-phase errors. Then, we
leverage the spectral sparsity of snapshot data in the frequency domain and the
spatial sparsity of incident directions to perform the DOA estimation according
to the sparse reconstruction method. The proposed method does not require
iterative optimization, hence exhibiting low computational complexity.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DOA estimation method achieves
higher estimation accuracy for coherent sources as compared to various
benchmark schemes.

### [6] [Robust MIMO Semantic Communication with Imperfect CSI via Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04005)
*Mingze Gong,Shuoyao Wang,Shijian Gao,Jia Yan,Suzhi Bi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HANA-JSCC的语义图像传输系统，通过信道矩阵和噪声的自适应处理，解决了MIMO系统中信道估计误差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIMO语义通信系统假设信道矩阵估计完美，不实用。本研究旨在应对信道估计误差。

Method: 提出信道矩阵适配器与信道编解码器协作，适应不匹配的信道状态信息；引入两阶段训练策略和知识蒸馏解决病态问题。

Result: HANA-JSCC在多个数据集和噪声/误差水平下，性能比现有基准高0.40~0.54dB。

Conclusion: HANA-JSCC有效解决了信道估计误差问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemComm) has emerged as a new communication paradigm.
To enhance efficiency, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology has
been further integrated into SemComm systems. However, existing MIMO SemComm
systems assume perfect channel matrix estimation for channel-adaptive joint
source-channel coding, which is impractical due to hardware and pilot overhead
constraints. In this paper, we propose a semantic image transmission system
with channel matrix and channel noise adaptation, named HANA-JSCC, to cope with
channel estimation errors in MIMO systems. We propose a channel matrix adaptor
that collaborates with the channel codec to adapt to misaligned channel state
information, thereby mitigating the impact of estimation errors. Since the
relationship between the estimated channel matrix and true channel matrix is
ill-posed (one-to-many), we further introduce a two-stage training strategy
with knowledge distillation to overcome the convergence difficulties caused by
the ill-posed problem. Comparing with the state-of-the-art benchmarks,
HANA-JSCC achieves $0.40\sim0.54$dB higher average performance across various
noise and estimation error levels in various datasets.

### [7] [Constellation Shaping for OFDM-ISAC Systems: From Theoretical Bounds to Practical Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04055)
*Benedikt Geiger,Fan Liu,Shihang Lu,Andrej Rode,Daniel Gil Gaviria,Charlotte Muth,Laurent Schmalen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了正交频分复用(OFDM)系统中通过星座整形同时提升感知和通信性能的可行性及方法，提出了一种联合整形方案，并验证了其优于传统调制方式的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合感知与通信(ISAC)为移动通信系统提供了新的用例，但感知和通信对调制格式的要求存在冲突，导致性能折中。论文旨在通过星座整形解决这一问题。

Method: 论文通过自动编码器优化，研究了几何、概率及联合星座整形方法，并提出了针对ISAC的广义概率幅度整形(PAS)及其低复杂度实现方案。

Result: 结果显示，星座整形能灵活权衡感知与通信性能，接近理论上限，显著优于传统调制方式。广义PAS在低复杂度下表现出色。

Conclusion: 星座整形尤其是联合整形和广义PAS，为ISAC提供了灵活且高效的性能提升途径，实用性强。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) promises new use cases for
mobile communication systems by reusing the communication signal for radar-like
sensing. However, sensing and communications (S&C) impose conflicting
requirements on the modulation format, resulting in a tradeoff between their
corresponding performance. This paper investigates constellation shaping as a
means to simultaneously improve S&C performance in orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC systems. We begin by deriving how the
transmit symbols affect detection performance and derive theoretical lower and
upper bounds on the maximum achievable information rate under a given sensing
constraint. Using an autoencoder-based optimization, we investigate geometric,
probabilistic, and joint constellation shaping, where joint shaping combines
both approaches, employing both optimal maximum a-posteriori decoding and
practical bit-metric decoding. Our results show that constellation shaping
enables a flexible trade-off between S&C, can approach the derived upper bound,
and significantly outperforms conventional modulation formats. Motivated by its
practical implementation feasibility, we review probabilistic amplitude shaping
(PAS) and propose a generalization tailored to ISAC. For this generalization,
we propose a low-complexity log-likelihood ratio computation with negligible
rate loss. We demonstrate that combining conventional and generalized PAS
enables a flexible and low-complexity tradeoff between S&C, closely approaching
the performance of joint constellation shaping.

### [8] [Reliable Clutter Suppression for Slow-Moving Weak Target Radar Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04309)
*R. Zhang,J. Xue,T. Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Go分解（Godec）框架的杂波抑制方案，用于复杂环境中慢速弱小目标的可靠检测，相比传统MTI方案具有更高的可靠性，但牺牲了时间复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂环境中强反射体的掩蔽效应使得慢速弱小目标的检测具有挑战性，传统MTI方案可能同时抑制干扰物和目标信号。

Method: 利用距离-速度图的低秩和稀疏特性，提出基于Godec框架的杂波抑制方案。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方案在掩蔽效应存在时能可靠检测目标，但时间消耗较高。实验中揭示了误报细胞数、检测概率和收敛迭代次数之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Godec方案以时间复杂性为代价提升了检测可靠性，并通过实验验证了其适用场景。

Abstract: Reliable slow-moving weak target detection in complicated environments is
challenging due to the masking effects from the surrounding strong reflectors.
The traditional Moving Target Indication (MTI) may suppress the echoes from not
only the static interference objects (IOs), but also the desired slow-moving
weak target. According to the low-rank and sparse properties of the
range-velocity maps across different radar scans, a novel clutter suppression
scheme based on the Go decomposition (Godec) framework is proposed in this
paper. The simulation results show that with the existence of masking effects,
the target detection scheme based on Godec clutter suppression can reliably
detect the slow-moving weak target, compared to the traditional MTI-based
scheme. Besides, the time consumption comparison is conducted, demonstrating
that the proposed solution is one that sacrifices time complexity in exchange
for enhanced reliability. Additionally, the tradeoffs among the number of false
alarm cells, the detection probability and the iteration times for convergence
have been revealed, guiding parameter settings of the proposed solution in
practical applications. Experiment validation is also conducted to verify the
proposed solution, providing further insight into the scenarios where the
solution is most applicable.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了无人机群体定位精度，同时揭示了通信与定位性能的相互影响。

Abstract: Relative localization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in global
navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied environments is essential for
emergency rescue and battlefield reconnaissance. Existing methods suffer from
significant localization errors among UAVs due to packet loss and high
computational complexity in large swarms. This paper proposes a
clustering-based framework where the UAVs simultaneously use communication
signals for channel estimation and ranging. Firstly, the spectral clustering is
utilized to divide the UAV swarm into different sub-clusters, where matrix
completion and multidimensional scaling yield high-precision relative
coordinates. Subsequently, a global map is created by the inter-cluster anchor
fusion. A case study of UAV integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) system
is presented, where the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is adopted for
ranging and communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method
reduces localization errors in large swarms and loss of range information. It
also explores the impact of signal parameters on communication and
localization, highlighting the interplay between communication and localization
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法结合群体智能与机械稳定性原理，为通信受限环境中的复杂运输任务提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: In comparison with existing approaches, which struggle with scalability,
communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures, cooperative
aerial transportation via robot swarms holds transformative potential for
logistics and disaster response. Here, we present a physics-inspired
cooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the
dissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a
decentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous
formation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of
explicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended
payload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to
energy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control
system is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors
of the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches
under the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and
payload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying
robots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success
rate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,
and 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor
winds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges
swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable
framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex
transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂环境和多样物体形状下具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decision-making in cooperative grasping for
two-robot object transport in constrained environments. The core of the
framework is a Conditional Embedding (CE) model consisting of two neural
networks that map grasp configuration information into an embedding space. The
resulting embedding vectors are then used to identify feasible grasp
configurations that allow two robots to collaboratively transport an object. To
ensure generalizability across diverse environments and object geometries, the
neural networks are trained on a dataset comprising a range of environment maps
and object shapes. We employ a supervised learning approach with negative
sampling to ensure that the learned embeddings effectively distinguish between
feasible and infeasible grasp configurations. Evaluation results across a wide
range of environments and objects in simulations demonstrate the model's
ability to reliably identify feasible grasp configurations. We further validate
the framework through experiments on a physical robotic platform, confirming
its practical applicability.

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

Abstract: Accurate real-time buoyancy modeling is essential for high-fidelity
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) simulations, yet NVIDIA Isaac Sim lacks a
native buoyancy system, requiring external solutions for precise underwater
physics. This paper presents a novel convex hull-based approach to dynamically
compute the submerged volume of an AUV in real time. By extracting mesh
geometry from the simulation environment and calculating the hull portion
intersecting the water level along the z-axis, our method enhances accuracy
over traditional geometric approximations. A cross-sectional area extension
reduces computational overhead, enabling efficient buoyant force updates that
adapt to orientation, depth, and sinusoidal wave fluctuations (+-0.3 m). Tested
on a custom AUV design for SAUVC 2025, this approach delivers real-time
performance and scalability, improving simulation fidelity for underwater
robotics research without precomputed hydrodynamic models.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Quadruped-based mobile manipulation presents significant challenges in
robotics due to the diversity of required skills, the extended task horizon,
and partial observability. After presenting a multi-stage pick-and-place task
as a succinct yet sufficiently rich setup that captures key desiderata for
quadruped-based mobile manipulation, we propose an approach that can train a
visuo-motor policy entirely in simulation, and achieve nearly 80\% success in
the real world. The policy efficiently performs search, approach, grasp,
transport, and drop into actions, with emerged behaviors such as re-grasping
and task chaining. We conduct an extensive set of real-world experiments with
ablation studies highlighting key techniques for efficient training and
effective sim-to-real transfer. Additional experiments demonstrate deployment
across a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. Demo videos and additional

### [17] [Reactive In-Air Clothing Manipulation with Confidence-Aware Dense Correspondence and Visuotactile Affordance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03889)
*Neha Sunil,Megha Tippur,Arnau Saumell,Edward Adelson,Alberto Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合视觉触觉的双臂框架，用于处理褶皱和悬挂的衣物。通过自信感知的密集视觉对应和触觉监督的抓取能力，系统能够在不确定状态下自适应调整策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 衣物操作因复杂的配置、多变的材料动态和频繁的自遮挡而具有挑战性。传统方法常需衣物平坦或关键特征可见，限制了实用性。

Method: 框架包括两个主要模块：基于置信度的视觉对应模型和触觉监督的抓取能力网络。前者通过高保真模拟数据集训练，后者利用高分辨率触觉反馈自监督学习。

Result: 系统能够处理高度遮挡的桌面上和空中衣物配置，并在折叠和悬挂任务中展示了任务无关的抓取选择模块。

Conclusion: 该框架为衣物操作提供了通用且可扩展的解决方案，其密集描述符还能用于其他规划任务，如从人类视频中提取抓取目标。

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于建筑外表的复杂性和GPS信号不可靠，传统定位传感器不适用，因此需要依赖机器人里程计，但其易受漂移影响，需高精度姿势估计。

Method: 采用EKF和UKF融合多模态数据，并使用非线性优化、Levenberg-Marquardt、遗传算法和粒子群算法校准系统参数。

Result: 通过实验验证了校准方法和姿势估计器的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法是爬墙机器人高精度定位的有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a pose estimator for a four wheel
independent steer four wheel independent drive (4WIS4WID) wall climbing mobile
robot, based on the fusion of multimodal measurements, including wheel
odometry, visual odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The pose
estimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their
operational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and
maintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the
building at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material
properties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors
such as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing
robots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these
environments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and
electromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary
source of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift
caused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the
robot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and
Levenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting
methods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as
stochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and
results of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail
with experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot.

Conclusion: FPC-VLA通过故障预测与纠正机制，实现了更可靠的自主系统，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However,
traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks
due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial
mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these
challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with
a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates
action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective
strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A
similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past
predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and
LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly
increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful
real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong
generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous
systems.

Abstract: While current onboard state estimation methods are adequate for most driving

interaction between tires and road surfaces. This paper explores a novel
communication concept for efficiently transmitting integrated wheel sensor data
from an ESP32 microcontroller. Our proposed approach utilizes a
publish-subscribe system, surpassing comparable solutions in the literature
regarding data transmission volume. We tested this approach on a drum tire test
rig with our prototype sensors system utilizing a diverse selection of sample
frequencies between 1 Hz and 32 000 Hz to demonstrate the efficacy of our
communication concept. The implemented prototype sensor showcases minimal data
loss, approximately 0.1 % of the sampled data, validating the reliability of
our developed communication system. This work contributes to advancing
real-time data acquisition, providing insights into optimizing integrated wheel
sensor communication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于流匹配的VLA模型在复杂下游任务中动作准确性不足，主要是因为其仅依赖模仿学习的后训练范式，无法深入理解数据质量分布特性。

Method: 提出了离线RL后训练目标，并设计了ARFM算法，通过自适应调整比例因子构建了一个偏差-方差权衡的目标函数，以优化RL信号对流动损失的影响。

Conclusion: ARFM通过平衡RL优势保留和流动损失梯度方差控制，实现了更稳定高效的微调过程，显著提升了VLA模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

Result: 实验证明DRLR在任务中表现稳健，适用于不同状态-动作维度及演示质量的任务，并在实际轮式装载机任务中成功部署。

Conclusion: DRLR框架通过改进的动作选择和SAC策略，有效提升了探索效率并实现了实际工业应用的部署。

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

Conclusion: 扩散基动作模型在机器人运动规划中展现了高效性能，优于传统数值方法。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效，适用于实际机器人操作任务，尤其适合需要快速响应的场景。

Abstract: Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various
robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of
the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects
efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.
Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating
potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,
these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several
candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally
efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most
informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the
camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the
whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint
without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and
realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying
sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning
strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world
experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed
method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no
significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method
is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in
terms of the average time the robot spends between views.

Abstract: Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics
applications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive
tasks, facilitating data sharing, and enhancing robot coordination. However,
integrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to
network latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource
management. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for
testing cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main
components enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud
cluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system
incorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling
bidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot
simulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To
achieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for
aerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce
artificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions
encountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.

Result: 数值仿真验证了模型准确性，并开发了半解析迭代方案解决逆运动学问题。

Conclusion: LASEM框架通过优化功能最小化，自然地融入电缆势能，无需显式接触建模，实现了高效实时应用。

Abstract: Continuum robots, inspired by octopus arms and elephant trunks, combine
dexterity with intrinsic compliance, making them well suited for unstructured
and confined environments. Yet their continuously deformable morphology poses
challenges for motion planning and control, calling for accurate but
lightweight models. We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling
(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation
potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical
forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via
Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone
contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying
kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the
framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,
distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally
efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a
semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To
address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the
functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally
incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that

of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision

environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection

We propose reinterpreting jitter-afflicted linear time-invariant systems
through equivalent jitter-free analogs. By constructing a perceived system that
absorbs the effects of timing perturbations into its dynamics, we find an
affine scaling of jitter. We examine both measurement and implementation
scenarios, demonstrating that the presence of jitter effectively scales the
system matrices. Moreover, we observe that, in the Laplace domain, jitter can
be interpreted as a frequency scaling.

Abstract: This communication on collision avoidance with unexpected obstacles is
motivated by some critical appraisals on reinforcement learning (RL) which
"requires ridiculously large numbers of trials to learn any new task" (Yann
LeCun). We use the classic Dubins' car in order to replace RL with
flatness-based control, combined with the HEOL feedback setting, and the latest
model-free predictive control approach. The two approaches lead to convincing
computer experiments where the results with the model-based one are only
slightly better. They exhibit a satisfactory robustness with respect to
randomly generated mismatches/disturbances, which become excellent in the
model-free case. Those properties would have been perhaps difficult to obtain
with today's popular machine learning techniques in AI. Finally, we should
emphasize that our two methods require a low computational burden.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单CBF约束，难以确保多状态约束下的安全性。

Result: 方法验证了多CBF约束的兼容性及控制器性能，并通过平面四旋翼仿真展示了有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为非线性系统多约束控制提供了可行方案，同时分析了安全约束对跟踪目标的潜在影响。

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for the constrained
control of nonlinear systems; however, the majority of results in the
literature focus on systems subject to a single CBF constraint, making it
challenging to synthesize provably safe controllers that handle multiple state
constraints. This paper presents a framework for constrained control of
nonlinear systems subject to box constraints on the systems' vector-valued
outputs using multiple CBFs. Our results illustrate that when the output has a
vector relative degree, the CBF constraints encoding these box constraints are
compatible, and the resulting optimization-based controller is locally
Lipschitz continuous and admits a closed-form expression. Additional results
are presented to characterize the degradation of nominal tracking objectives in
the presence of safety constraints. Simulations of a planar quadrotor are
presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

Abstract: The synthesis of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) often involves demanding
computations or a meticulous construction. However, structural properties of
the system dynamics and constraints have the potential to mitigate these
challenges. In this paper, we explore how equivariances in the dynamics,
loosely speaking a form of symmetry, can be leveraged in the CBF synthesis.
Although CBFs are generally not inherently symmetric, we show how equivariances
in the dynamics and symmetries in the constraints induce symmetries in CBFs
derived through reachability analysis. This insight allows us to infer their
CBF values across the entire domain from their values on a subset, leading to
significant computational savings. Interestingly, equivariances can be even
leveraged to the CBF synthesis for non-symmetric constraints. Specifically, we
show how a partially known CBF can be leveraged together with equivariances to
construct a CBF for various new constraints. Throughout the paper, we provide
examples illustrating the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a numerical study
investigates the computational gains from invoking equivariances into the CBF
synthesis.

Result: 仿真验证了方法能生成动态可行且安全的轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法仅依赖数据和凸优化，实现了多智能体的安全和同步运动。

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.

TL;DR: BiND模型通过两阶段设计（分类运动类型和GRU解码器）显著提升了BCI对双手运动的解码能力，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因神经表征重叠和非线性肢体交互导致的双手机动解码难题。

Method: 两阶段模型BiND先分类运动类型，再用带时间索引的GRU解码器预测连续2D手速。

Result: BiND在单双手机动预测中R²分别达0.76和0.69，优于GRU模型2%，且在会话间表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 任务感知分类和时间建模可有效提升双手机动解码性能。

Abstract: Decoding bimanual hand movements from intracortical recordings remains a
critical challenge for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), due to overlapping
neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions. We introduce BiND
(Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first
classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then
uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time
index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six
state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a
publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient.
BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69
($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model
(GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session
variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up
to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the
effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing
bimanual decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经算子（NO）在科学计算中的重要性日益增加，但其表示特性尚未充分研究。论文旨在通过稀疏模型恢复的框架探索和统一这些表示。

Method: 通过比较SAEs、提升-SAE和SAE神经算子的推理和训练动态，研究引入提升和算子模块对模型的积极归纳偏置。

Result: 该方法实现了更快的恢复、对平滑概念的更好恢复以及对不同分辨率的鲁棒推理。

Conclusion: 提升和算子模块的引入为神经算子提供了独特的优势，推动了其表示的统一和解释性。

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

Conclusion: 研究为将SNN整合到手指力量解码系统提供了实用指南，展示了如何根据应用需求选择输入表示以满足准确性、稳健性和内存效率。

Abstract: Restoring naturalistic finger control in assistive technologies requires the
continuous decoding of motor intent with high accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness. Here, we present a spike-based decoding framework that integrates
spiking neural networks (SNNs) with motor unit activity extracted from
high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays. We demonstrate simultaneous
and proportional decoding of individual finger forces from motor unit spike
trains during isometric contractions at 15% of maximum voluntary contraction
using SNNs. We systematically evaluated alternative SNN decoder configurations
and compared two possible input modalities: physiologically grounded motor unit
spike trains and spike-encoded intramuscular EMG signals. Through this
comparison, we quantified trade-offs between decoding accuracy, memory
footprint, and robustness to input errors. The results showed that shallow SNNs
can reliably decode finger-level motor intent with competitive accuracy and
minimal latency, while operating with reduced memory requirements and without
the need for external preprocessing buffers. This work provides a practical
blueprint for integrating SNNs into finger-level force decoding systems,
demonstrating how the choice of input representation can be strategically
tailored to meet application-specific requirements for accuracy, robustness,
and memory efficiency.

TL;DR: 研究探讨用户对社交机器人隐私感知的三大因素：信息使用透明度、用户控制权和机器人行为方式，发现用户控制权是影响隐私感知的关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交机器人在健康辅导中处理敏感信息，但用户隐私感知因素尚不明确。

Method: 通过在线实验（N=200）系统考察透明度、用户控制权和机器人行为方式的影响。

Result: 用户控制权显著提升隐私感知和信任，透明度和机器人主动性影响较小。

Conclusion: 仅提供信息或主动行为不足以满足隐私需求，需加强用户对信息处理的直接控制。

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly recognized as valuable supporters in the field
of well-being coaching. They can function as independent coaches or provide
support alongside human coaches, and healthcare professionals. In coaching
interactions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,
making privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the
factors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine
three key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,
(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their
information, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts
proactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =
200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,
they additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information
is interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that
provided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived
privacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of
transparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,
and we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing
users or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.
These insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that
allow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially
when social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用无人机和多光谱数据监测风力发电设备的缺陷，需要高分辨率数据和高效处理方法。

Method: 开发了一个结合YOLOv8通用模型和专用热成像模型的集成方法，采用边界框融合算法整合预测结果。

Result: 实验显示该方法的mAP@.5为0.93，F1分数为0.90，优于单一YOLOv8模型（mAP@.5为0.91）。

Conclusion: 结合多YOLO架构和多光谱数据能更可靠地检测视觉和热缺陷。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.
