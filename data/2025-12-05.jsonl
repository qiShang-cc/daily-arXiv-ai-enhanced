While existing models have made progress, they often degrade in performance when multiple transmitters coexist, due to the compounded effects of shadowing, interference from adjacent transmitters. To address this challenge, we extend our prior work on Physics-Informed Neural Networks~(PINNs) for single-transmitter mapping to derive a new multi-transmitter Partial Differential Equation~(PDE) formulation of the Received Signal Strength Indicator~(RSSI). We then propose \\emph{ReVeal-MT} (Re-constructor and Visualizer of Spectrum Landscape for Multiple Transmitters), a novel PINN which integrates the multi-source PDE residual into a neural network loss function, enabling accurate spectrum landscape reconstruction from sparse RF sensor measurements. ReVeal-MT is validated using real-world measurements from the ARA wireless living lab across rural and suburban environments, and benchmarked against 3GPP and ITU-R channel models and a baseline PINN model for a single transmitter use-case. Results show that ReVeal-MT achieves substantial accuracy gains in multi-transmitter scenarios, e.g., achieving an RMSE of only 2.66\\,dB with as few as 45 samples over a 370-square-kilometer region, while maintaining low computational complexity. These findings demonstrate that ReVeal-MT significantly advances radio environment mapping under realistic multi-transmitter conditions, with strong potential for enabling fine-grained spectrum management and precise coexistence between PUs and SUs."}

However, to meet emerging demands such as high-frequency operation, wide bandwidths, co-existence, integrated sensing, and resilience to dynamic interference, future systems must exhibit both scalability and spectral agility. These requirements place increasing pressure on the underlying processing hardware to be both efficient and reconfigurable. This paper proposes a custom-designed spatial array architecture that serves as a reconfigurable, general-purpose core optimized for a class of wireless kernels that commonly arise in diverse communications and sensing tasks. The proposed spatial array is evaluated against specialized cores for each kernel using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Both the reconfigurable and specialized designs are synthesized in a 32 nm process to assess latency, throughput, area, and power in realistic processes. The results identify conditions under which general-purpose systolic architectures can approach the efficiency of specialized cores, thereby paving the way toward more scalable and agile systems."}

We first model the problem of maximizing the sensing performance of multiple targets while satisfying the communication performance requirements of multiple users, where both the targets and users are UAVs. For mitigating in-waveguide attenuation and improving sensing performance, the segmented waveguide-enabled pinching antenna (SWAN) system is adopted. Furthermore, an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm for SWAN-based ISAC (SWISAC-AO) is developed, where the optimal structure of the transmit beamforming solution is derived. A graph neural network (GNN), termed SWISAC-GNN, is then proposed to jointly learn PA positions and transmit beamforming, with its alternative update procedure inspired by the SWISAC-AO algorithm.

We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning.

Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed. We then present a unified taxonomy that organizes recent research along three axes: i) semantic abstraction level (symbol/feature/intent/knowledge), ii) agent autonomy and coordination granularity (single-, multi-, and hierarchical-agent), and iii) RAN control placement across PHY/MAC, near-real-time RIC, and non-real-time RIC. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically introduce enabling technologies including task-oriented semantic encoders/decoders, multi-agent reinforcement learning, foundation-model-assisted RAN agents, and knowledge-graph-based reasoning for cross-layer awareness. Representative 6G use cases, such as immersive XR, vehicular V2X, and industrial digital twins, are analyzed to illustrate the semantic-agentic convergence in practice.

In realistic simulators such as CARLA, privileged state (e.g., lane geometry, infractions, time-to-collision) can be converted into dense rewards that stabilize and accelerate model-based reinforcement learning, but policies trained directly on these signals often overfit and fail to generalize when evaluated on sparse objectives such as route completion and collision-free overtaking. We propose reward-privileged world model distillation, a two-stage framework in which a teacher DreamerV3-style agent is first trained with a dense privileged reward, and only its latent dynamics are distilled into a student trained solely on sparse task rewards. Teacher and student share the same observation space (semantic bird's-eye-view images); privileged information enters only through the teacher's reward, and the student does not imitate the teacher's actions or value estimates. Instead, the student's world model is regularized to match the teacher's latent dynamics while its policy is learned from scratch on sparse success/failure signals. In CARLA lane-following and overtaking benchmarks, sparse-reward students outperform both dense-reward teachers and sparse-from-scratch baselines. On unseen lane-following routes, reward-privileged distillation improves success by about 23 percent relative to the dense teacher while maintaining comparable or better safety. On overtaking, students retain near-perfect performance on training routes and achieve up to a 27x improvement in success on unseen routes, with improved lane keeping. These results show that dense rewards can be leveraged to learn richer dynamics models while keeping the deployed policy optimized strictly for sparse, deployment-aligned objectives."}

These vehicles have limited processing capability and payload capacity, which makes advanced deep learning methods and heavy sensors impractical. Flying insects, such as bees, achieve remarkable landings with minimal neural and sensory resources, relying heavily on optical flow. By regulating flow divergence, a measure of vertical velocity divided by height, they perform smooth landings in which velocity and height decay exponentially together. However, adapting this bio-inspired strategy for spacecraft landings on sloped terrain presents two key challenges: global flow-divergence estimates obscure terrain inclination, and the nonlinear nature of divergence-based control can lead to instability when using conventional controllers. This paper proposes a nonlinear control strategy that leverages two distinct local flow divergence estimates to regulate both thrust and attitude during vertical landings. The control law is formulated based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion to handle the nonlinear flow divergence. The thrust control ensures a smooth vertical descent by keeping a constant average of the local flow divergence estimates, while the attitude control aligns the vehicle with the inclined surface at touchdown by exploiting their difference. The approach is evaluated in numerical simulations using a simplified 2D spacecraft model across varying slopes and divergence setpoints. Results show that regulating the average divergence yields stable landings with exponential decay of velocity and height, and using the divergence difference enables effective alignment with inclined terrain. Overall, the method offers a robust, low-resource landing strategy that enhances the feasibility of autonomous planetary missions with small spacecraft."}

This paper investigates a more practical multiuser pinching-antenna system under a composite probabilistic channel model that captures distance-dependent LoS blockage and NLoS scattering. To account for both efficiency and reliability aspects of communication, two complementary design metrics are considered: an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric characterizing long-term throughput and fairness, and an outage-constrained metric ensuring a prescribed reliability level. Based on these metrics, we formulate two optimization problems: the first maximizes the max-min average SNR across users, while the second maximizes a guaranteed SNR threshold under per-user outage constraints. Although both problems are inherently nonconvex, we exploit their underlying monotonic structures and develop low-complexity, bisection-based algorithms that achieve globally optimal solutions using only simple scalar evaluations. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems significantly outperform conventional fixed-antenna designs even under random LoS and NLoS channels."}

This mitigates the performance degradation that arise when a single policy is forced to fuse heterogeneous, potentially mismatched observations from locomotion and manipulation. Our key innovation lies in restoring coordination between these two independent policies through a vision-language foundation model, which encodes global observations and language instructions into a shared latent embedding conditioning both diffusion policies. On top of this backbone, we introduce a phase-progress head that uses textual descriptions of task stages to infer discrete phase and continuous progress estimates without manual phase labels. To further structure the latent space, we incorporate a coordination-aware contrastive loss that explicitly encodes cross-subsystem compatibility between arm and base actions.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising avenue, but existing contrastive paradigms rely on data augmentations that conflict with the physical semantics of radio signals and require large-batch training, making them poorly suited for CSI. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CIG-MAE -- a Cross-modal Information-Guided Masked Autoencoder -- that reconstructs both the amplitude and phase of CSI using a symmetric dual-stream architecture with a high masking ratio. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Information-Guided Masking strategy that dynamically allocates attention to time-frequency regions with high information density to improve learning efficiency, and incorporate a Barlow Twins regularizer to align cross-modal representations without negative samples.

However, its known analytical intractability presents persistent channel characterization and performance analysis challenges. This paper introduces two effective and mathematically tractable surrogate models for the Lognormal distribution, constructed from the product of Nakagami-$m$ and Inverse Nakagami-$m$ (I-Nakagami-$m$) variates. These models yield asymptotically exact closed-form expressions for key performance metrics -- including the characteristic function, bit error rate, and Shannon's capacity -- and enable analytically tractable expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the composite $α$-$μ$-Lognormal fading model. To facilitate implementation, a moment-matching framework is developed to map the Lognormal parameters to the surrogate model parameters. In addition, a random mixture approach is proposed to enhance convergence by exploiting the complementary approximation properties of the Nakagami-$m$ and I-Nakagami-$m$ distributions. The methodology is further extended to heterogeneous cascaded fading channels comprising arbitrary combinations of $α$-$μ$, $κ$-$μ$, and $η$-$μ$ variates, for which moment-based mappings to the equivalent Lognormal distributions are derived. Numerical results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach, positioning it as a practical and reliable alternative to exact Lognormal statistics."}

Moreover, their disassembly requires sequential, precise, and dexterous operations, further increasing the complexity of automation. Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation. These findings highlight the current limitations of VLA models in handling the dexterity and precision required for robotic EoL product disassembly. By offering a detailed analysis of the observed results, this study provides insights that may inform future research to address current challenges and advance end-to-end robotic automated disassembly."}

This optimization typically assumes prior knowledge of the target direction, which is unavailable before the target is detected. To enhance direction estimation, it is critical to develop array pattern synthesis techniques that yield a wider beam by maximizing the received power over the entire target area. Although this challenge has been addressed with active antennas, RIS systems pose a unique challenge due to their inherent phase constraints, which can be continuous or discrete.\n  This work addresses this challenge through a novel array pattern synthesis method tailored for discrete phase constraints in RIS. We introduce a penalty method that pushes these constraints to the boundary of the convex hull. Then, the Minorization-Maximization (MM) method is utilized to reformulate the problem into a convex one. Our numerical results show that our algorithm can generate a wide beam pattern comparable to that achievable with per-power constraints, with both the amplitudes and phases being adjustable. We compare our method with a traditional beam sweeping technique, showing a) several orders of magnitude reduction of the MSE of Angle of Arrival (AOA) at low to medium Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)s; and b) $8$~dB SNR reduction to achieve a high probability of detection."}

BALI combines language and action cues from the human, asks clarifying questions only when the expected information gain from the answer outweighs the cost of interruption, and selects supportive actions that align with inferred goals.

Deep learning (DL)-based methods have gained wide attention due to their excellent performance, but research mainly focuses on single-input single-output (SISO) systems, with limited exploration for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The confounding effects of multi-antenna channels can interfere with the statistical properties of MIMO signals, making identification particularly challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Channel-Aware Multi-Domain feature extraction (CAMD) framework for AMR in MIMO systems. Our CAMD framework reconstructs the transmitted signal through an efficient channel compensation module and achieves a more robust representation capability against channel interference by extracting and integrating multi-domain features, including intra-antenna temporal correlations and inter-antenna channel correlations. We have verified our method on the widely-used dataset, MIMOSig-Ref, with complex mobile channel environments. Extensive experiments confirm the performance advantages of CAMD over previous state-of-the-art methods."}

Existing methods such as domain randomization, adaptation, and sim-real calibration often require extensive tuning or fail to generalize to unseen scenarios. To address this issue, we observe that if domain-invariant features are utilized during policy training in simulation, and the same features can be extracted and provided as the input to policy during real-world deployment, the domain gap can be effectively bridged, leading to significantly improved policy generalization. Accordingly, we propose Semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (S2GS), a novel representation method that extracts object-centric, domain-invariant spatial features. S2GS constructs multi-view 2D semantic fields and projects them into a unified 3D space via feature-level Gaussian splatting. A semantic filtering mechanism removes irrelevant background content, ensuring clean and consistent inputs for policy learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2GS, we adopt Diffusion Policy as the downstream learning algorithm and conduct experiments in the ManiSkill simulation environment, followed by real-world deployment. Results demonstrate that S2GS significantly improves sim-to-real transferability, maintaining high and stable task performance in real-world scenarios."}

Extending a well-known distributed optimization strategy called diffusion adaptation to Riemannian manifolds, we show that the resulting algorithm, the Riemannian diffusion adaptation, provably exhibits several desirable behaviors when minimizing a sum of geodesically smooth non-convex functions over manifolds of bounded curvature. More specifically, we establish that the algorithm can approximately achieve network agreement in the sense that Fréchet variance of the iterates among the agents is small. Moreover, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a first-order stationary point for general geodesically non-convex cost functions. When the global cost function additionally satisfies the Riemannian Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition, we also show that it converges linearly under a constant step size up to a steady-state error.

This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields.

Our key contribution is a Markov-renewal process (MRP) formulation that, for the first time, analytically predicts the mean and variance of registered photon counts under dead time. To make this MRP model computationally tractable, we introduce a spectral truncation rule that efficiently computes the complex covariance statistics. By proving the shift-invariance of the process, we extend this per-pixel model to full histogram cube generation via a precomputed lookup table. Our method generates 3D cubes indistinguishable from the sequential gold-standard, yet is orders of magnitude faster. This finally enables large-scale, physically-faithful data generation for learning-based SP-LiDAR reconstruction."}

Vineyards pose significant challenges due to their dynamic nature, and they are increasingly drawing attention from both academic and industrial stakeholders interested in automation.

At the center-stage, while waveguide based pinching antennas have been shown to beneficially ameliorate wireless propagation environments, their applications have remained confined to high-frequency scenarios. As a remedy, we propose a downlink generalized pinching-antenna system that adapts this compelling concept to low-frequency operation through a leaky-coaxial-cable (LCX) implementation. By endowing LCX structures with controllable radiation slots, the system inherits the key capabilities of waveguide based pinching antennas. Explicitly, these include reconfigurable line-of-sight (LoS) links, reduced path loss, and flexible deployment, while supporting a practical implementation of the pinching-antenna concept at low frequencies. A twin-stage propagation model is developed for characterizing both the guided transmission and wireless radiation encountered over LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths. Analytical results reveal strong local gain, complemented by rapid distance-dependent decay. Hence, we conceive a matching joint optimization framework, which maximizes throughput by harnessing game-theoretic association and convex power allocation.

If, however, the drone starts moving to the next point and it turns out that a follow-up action is needed at the previous point, it must spend time to fly-back. To take this decision, we propose different machine-learning methods based on branch prediction and reinforcement learning. We evaluate these methods for a wide range of scenarios where the probability of event occurrence changes with time. Our results show that the proposed methods consistently outperform the regression-based method proposed in the literature and can significantly improve the worst-case mission time by up to 4.1x.

Among various types of sensing media, WiFi signals offer advantages such as widespread availability, low hardware cost, and strong robustness to environmental conditions like light, temperature, and humidity. By analyzing Wi-Fi signals in the environment, it is possible to capture dynamic changes of the human body and accomplish sensing applications such as gesture recognition. Although many existing gesture sensing solutions perform well in-domain but lack cross-domain capabilities (i.e., recognition performance in untrained environments). To address this, we extract Doppler spectra from the channel state information (CSI) received by all receivers and concatenate each Doppler spectrum along the same time axis to generate fused images with multi-angle information as input features. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), we propose a gesture recognition network that integrates a multi-semantic spatial attention mechanism with a self-attention-based channel mechanism. This network constructs attention maps to quantify the spatiotemporal features of gestures in images, enabling the extraction of key domain-independent features. Additionally, ResNet18 is employed as the backbone network to further capture deep-level features. To validate the network performance, we evaluate the proposed network on the public Widar3 dataset, and the results show that it not only maintains high in-domain accuracy of 99.72%, but also achieves high performance in cross-domain recognition of 97.61%, significantly outperforming existing best solutions."}

The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight reference-based and disturbance-aware planning, especially FLC, as effective tools for training and for achieving fast yet stable trajectories."}

We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility."}

Preprint prepared for journal submission", "summary": "Accurate channel modeling for spherical absorbing receivers is fundamental to the design of realistic molecular multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. While advanced modulation schemes have been proposed to mitigate interference, determining the channel impulse response (CIR) under arbitrary flow directions remains a challenge; existing exact solutions are restricted to either 1-D/no-drift scenarios or planar receiver geometries. Addressing this gap, we derive the first exact analytical CIR for a spherical receiver in a 3-D molecular communication system with uniform drift in an arbitrary direction. Unlike prior approximations that ignore the angle between the drift and the transmission axis, our approach utilizes the Girsanov theorem to analytically transform the hitting-time distribution from a stationary medium to a drifted one. The proposed closed-form expression not only eliminates modeling errors inherent in previous approximations for off-axis receivers but also enables efficient parameter-space exploration of critical system metrics (e.g., peak time and amplitude), a task that would be computationally costly with pure simulation-based approaches."}

This task, however, poses fundamental challenges due to the exponential scaling of state space with system size. We introduce shadow tomography-based transmission with unequal error protection (STT-UEP), a novel communication protocol that enables efficient transmission of properties of quantum states, allowing decoder-side estimation of arbitrary observables. Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results."}

However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task."}

To capture terrain deformation effects, Project Chrono's Soil Contact Model (SCM) is integrated with the articulated multibody dynamics, enabling prediction of slip, sinkage, and load redistribution that reduce stride efficiency on deformable substrates. For high-energy rolling locomotion on steep slopes, the Chrono DEM Engine is used to simulate particle-resolved granular interactions, revealing soil failure, intermittent lift-off, and energy dissipation mechanisms not captured by rigid models. Together, these methods span real-time control-oriented simulation and high-fidelity granular physics. Results demonstrate that rigid-ground models provide accurate short-horizon motion prediction, while continuum and particle-based terrain modeling becomes necessary for reliable mobility analysis in soft and highly dynamic environments.

To realize this potential, a key research question remains open: how can a humanoid execute the human actions from generated videos in a zero-shot manner? This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements over strong baselines in simulation and confirm coherent, physically stable motion tracking on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot without fine-tuning. This work offers a promising path to realizing the potential of video generation models as high-level policies for robot control."}

Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone.

Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively.

From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues.

We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion φ-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. φ-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos.
