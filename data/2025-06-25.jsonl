However, this approach incurs high implementation costs and substantial\nfronthaul demands due to the need for dedicated RF chains for all antennas. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a hybrid beamforming framework that\nintegrates wave-domain beamforming via stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM)\nwith conventional digital processing. By dynamically manipulating\nelectromagnetic waves, SIM-equipped APs enhance beamforming gains while\nsignificantly reducing RF chain requirements. We formulate a joint optimization\nproblem for digital and wave-domain beamforming along with fronthaul\ncompression to maximize the weighted sum-rate for both uplink and downlink\ntransmission under finite-capacity fronthaul constraints. Given the high\ndimensionality and non-convexity of the problem, we develop alternating\noptimization-based algorithms that iteratively optimize digital and wave-domain\nvariables. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid schemes\noutperform conventional hybrid schemes, that rely on randomly set wave-domain\nbeamformers or restrict digital beamforming to simple power control.

This inter-token dependency\nmakes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can\nsignificantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this\npaper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token\nsimilarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage\nchannels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is\ncombinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To\naddress this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with\nlookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces\nthe residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the\nmessage-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain\ntoken packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a\nlookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates\nwithout replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates\nsampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.\nExperiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned\nimages) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores\ncomparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up\nto 40$\\times$.
