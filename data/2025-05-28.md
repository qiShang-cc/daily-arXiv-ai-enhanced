### [1] [Federated Learning-Distillation Alternation for Resource-Constrained IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20456)
*Rafael Valente da Silva,Onel L. Alcaraz López,Richard Demo Souza*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了FL-distillation alternation (FLDA)方法，通过在联邦学习（FL）和联邦蒸馏（FD）之间交替，平衡通信开销和模型精度，适用于能量受限的IoT网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决IoT网络中因设备能源和通信资源有限，导致传统FL在能量收集（EH）环境下性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出FLDA方法，设备在FL和FD阶段交替运行，减少通信开销和能耗。

Result: FLDA在模型精度和收敛速度上优于FL和FD，节省高达98%的能耗，且对干扰更不敏感。

Conclusion: FLDA是一种高效的替代方案，适合资源受限的IoT网络。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces significant challenges in Internet of Things
(IoT) networks due to device limitations in energy and communication resources,
especially when considering the large size of FL models. From an energy
perspective, the challenge is aggravated if devices rely on energy harvesting
(EH), as energy availability can vary significantly over time, influencing the
average number of participating users in each iteration. Additionally, the
transmission of large model updates is more susceptible to interference from
uncorrelated background traffic in shared wireless environments. As an
alternative, federated distillation (FD) reduces communication overhead and
energy consumption by transmitting local model outputs, which are typically
much smaller than the entire model used in FL. However, this comes at the cost
of reduced model accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose FL-distillation
alternation (FLDA). In FLDA, devices alternate between FD and FL phases,
balancing model information with lower communication overhead and energy
consumption per iteration. We consider a multichannel slotted-ALOHA EH-IoT
network subject to background traffic/interference. In such a scenario, FLDA
demonstrates higher model accuracy than both FL and FD, and achieves faster
convergence than FL. Moreover, FLDA achieves target accuracies saving up to 98%
in energy consumption, while also being less sensitive to interference, both
relative to FL.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为BrainStratify的框架，用于解码颅内神经信号中的语音，通过分层和模块化方法解决了神经信号分布稀疏和任务无关信号干扰的问题，实验表明其显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解码神经活动中的语音是脑机接口研究的核心目标，但现有方法面临两个关键挑战：(1) 与任务相关的神经信号在sEEG电极上稀疏分布；(2) 这些信号常与任务无关的神经信号纠缠在一起。

Method: 提出BrainStratify框架，包括：(1) 通过时空建模识别功能组；(2) 使用解耦量化（DPQ）在目标功能组内分离不同的神经动态。

Result: 在多个公开数据集（sEEG和ECoG）上的实验表明，BrainStratify显著优于之前的解码方法。

Conclusion: 结合数据驱动的分层和神经科学启发的模块化，BrainStratify为颅内记录的语音解码提供了鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Decoding speech directly from neural activity is a central goal in
brain-computer interface (BCI) research. In recent years, exciting advances
have been made through the growing use of intracranial field potential
recordings, such as stereo-ElectroEncephaloGraphy (sEEG) and
ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG). These neural signals capture rich population-level
activity but present key challenges: (i) task-relevant neural signals are
sparsely distributed across sEEG electrodes, and (ii) they are often entangled
with task-irrelevant neural signals in both sEEG and ECoG. To address these
challenges, we introduce a unified Coarse-to-Fine neural disentanglement
framework, BrainStratify, which includes (i) identifying functional groups
through spatial-context-guided temporal-spatial modeling, and (ii)
disentangling distinct neural dynamics within the target functional group using
Decoupled Product Quantization (DPQ). We evaluate BrainStratify on two
open-source sEEG datasets and one (epidural) ECoG dataset, spanning tasks like
vocal production and speech perception. Extensive experiments show that
BrainStratify, as a unified framework for decoding speech from intracranial
neural signals, significantly outperforms previous decoding methods. Overall,
by combining data-driven stratification with neuroscience-inspired modularity,
BrainStratify offers a robust and interpretable solution for speech decoding
from intracranial recordings.

Abstract: Accurate ECG interpretation is vital, yet complex cardiac data and
"black-box" AI models limit clinical utility. Inspired by Transformer
architectures' success in NLP for understanding sequential data, we frame ECG
as the heart's unique "language" of temporal patterns. We present
CardioPatternFormer, a novel Transformer-based model for interpretable ECG
classification. It employs a sophisticated attention mechanism to precisely
identify and classify diverse cardiac patterns, excelling at discerning subtle
anomalies and distinguishing multiple co-occurring conditions. This
pattern-guided attention provides clear insights by highlighting influential
signal regions, effectively allowing the "heart to talk" through transparent
interpretations. CardioPatternFormer demonstrates robust performance on
challenging ECGs, including complex multi-pathology cases. Its interpretability
via attention maps enables clinicians to understand the model's rationale,
fostering trust and aiding informed diagnostic decisions. This work offers a
powerful, transparent solution for advanced ECG analysis, paving the way for
more reliable and clinically actionable AI in cardiology.

### [5] [A Unified RCS Modeling of Typical Targets for 3GPP ISAC Channel Standardization and Experimental Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20673)
*Yuxiang Zhang,Jianhua Zhang,Xidong Hu,Jiwei Zhang,Hongbo Xing,Huiwen Gong,Shilin Luo,Yifeng Xiong,Li Yu,Zhiqing Yuan,Guangyi Liu,Tao Jiang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的RCS建模框架，解决了现有模型复杂且缺乏通用性的问题，并通过实验验证了模型对无人机、人类和车辆等目标的RCS变化的有效捕获。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RCS模型针对特定目标类型设计，复杂且缺乏通用性，难以满足3GPP ISAC通道模型的需求。

Method: 将RCS分解为三个组件：大尺度功率因子、小尺度角度依赖组件和随机组件。

Result: 通过实验验证了模型对不同目标类型RCS变化的有效捕获，并成功集成到ISAC通道仿真平台中。

Conclusion: 该模型为未来ISAC系统设计提供了有价值的见解，特别是在路径损耗、延迟扩展和角度扩展方面。

Abstract: Accurate radar cross section (RCS) modeling is crucial for characterizing
target scattering and improving the precision of Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) channel modeling. Existing RCS models are typically
designed for specific target types, leading to increased complexity and lack of
generalization. This makes it difficult to standardize RCS models for 3GPP ISAC
channels, which need to account for multiple typical target types
simultaneously. Furthermore, 3GPP models must support both system-level and
link-level simulations, requiring the integration of large-scale and
small-scale scattering characteristics. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a unified RCS modeling framework that consolidates these two aspects.
The model decomposes RCS into three components: (1) a large-scale power factor
representing overall scattering strength, (2) a small-scale angular-dependent
component describing directional scattering, and (3) a random component
accounting for variations across target instances. We validate the model
through mono-static RCS measurements for UAV, human, and vehicle targets across
five frequency bands. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can
effectively capture RCS variations for different target types. Finally, the
model is incorporated into an ISAC channel simulation platform to assess the
impact of target RCS characteristics on path loss, delay spread, and angular
spread, providing valuable insights for future ISAC system design.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 为提升全息多输入多输出（HMIMO）系统中传统单极化堆叠智能超表面（SIM）因集成空间受限导致的波域信号处理能力不足，论文提出了一种双极化SIM（DPSIM）架构，通过堆叠双极化可重构智能表面（DPRIS）独立处理两正交极化信号，有效抑制极化交叉干扰（PCI）和流间干扰（ISI），并引入LGD-WF算法优化端到端性能。仿真表明，DPSIM-HMIMO系统在相同层数和单元尺寸下支持更多无ISI并行数据流，且在不同极化缺陷条件下显著提升频谱效率（SE）和能量效率（EE），接近理论上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单极化SIM在HMIMO系统中因集成空间限制，波域信号处理能力有限，导致极化交叉干扰和流间干扰问题突出。

Method: 提出双极化SIM（DPSIM）架构，堆叠DPRIS以独立处理两正交极化信号，并设计层间梯度下降加水填充（LGD-WF）算法优化性能。

Result: DPSIM-HMIMO系统在相同条件下支持更多无ISI数据流，且SE和EE显著提升，接近理论上限。

Conclusion: DPSIM架构通过双极化设计和LGD-WF算法有效解决了传统SIM的局限性，显著提升了HMIMO系统的性能。

Abstract: To address the limited wave domain signal processing capabilities of
traditional single-polarized stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) in
holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) systems, which stems from
limited integration space, this paper proposes a dual-polarized SIM (DPSIM)
architecture. By stacking dual-polarized reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(DPRIS), DPSIM can independently process signals of two orthogonal
polarizations in the wave domain, thereby effectively suppressing polarization
cross-interference (PCI) and inter-stream interference (ISI). We introduce a
layer-by-layer gradient descent with water-filling (LGD-WF) algorithm to
enhance end-to-end performance. Simulation results show that, under the same
number of metasurface layers and unit size, the DPSIM-aided HMIMO system can
support more simultaneous data streams for ISI-free parallel transmission
compared to traditional SIM-aided systems. Furthermore, under different
polarization imperfection conditions, both the spectral efficiency (SE) and
energy efficiency (EE) of the DPSIM-aided HMIMO system are significantly
improved, approaching the theoretical upper bound.

### [7] [Estimators and Performance Bounds for Short Periodic Pulses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20831)
*Sebastian Schertler,Oliver Lang,Jonas Lindenberger,Stefan Schuster,Stefan Scheiblhofer,Alexander Haberl,Clemens Staudinger,Mario Huemer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出针对短周期脉冲信号的两种模型（已知和未知脉冲形状），其最大似然估计器在低信噪比下优于传统的多谐波信号模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业应用中短周期脉冲信号常含大量噪声样本，传统多谐波模型不适用，需更优的估计方法。

Method: 提出两种短周期脉冲模型（已知/未知脉冲形状），推导对应最大似然估计器、Fisher信息矩阵和Cramér-Rao下界。

Result: 数值实验显示，新估计器在低信噪比下表现优于传统多谐波模型的最大似然估计器。

Conclusion: 针对短周期脉冲信号，新模型和估计器能有效提升低信噪比环境下的频率估计精度。

Abstract: In many industrial applications, signals with short periodic pulses, caused
by repeated steps in the manufacturing process, are present, and their
fundamental frequency or period may be of interest. Fundamental frequency
estimation is in many cases performed by describing the periodic signal as a
multiharmonic signal and employing the corresponding maximum likelihood
estimator. However, since signals with short periodic pulses contain a large
number of noise-only samples, the multiharmonic signal model is not optimal to
describe them. In this work, two models of short periodic pulses with known and
unknown pulse shape are considered. For both models, the corresponding maximum
likelihood estimators, Fisher information matrices, and approximate
Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds are presented. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed estimators outperform the maximum likelihood estimator based on the
multiharmonic signal model for low signal-to-noise ratios.

TL;DR: 论文研究了一种可穿戴设备的反射式脉搏血氧仪用于监测睡眠呼吸暂停患者的血氧饱和度的准确性和实用性，对比了上臂和手腕两种测量位置的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠呼吸暂停（SA）是一种慢性睡眠障碍，可能导致心脑血管疾病。传统诊断方法多导睡眠图（PSG）需要在医院过夜监测，而可穿戴设备的反射式脉搏血氧仪有望提供更便捷的连续监测方案。

Method: 研究分析了134名疑似SA患者的数据，这些患者在过夜PSG监测的同时佩戴了类似手表的设备，分别在手臂和手腕两个位置进行测量。

Result: 两种测量位置均符合标准脉搏血氧仪的要求，其中上臂的测量误差（均方根误差）为1.9%，优于手腕的3.2%。此外，上臂的数据拒收率为3.1%，远低于手腕的30.4%。

Conclusion: 上臂作为测量位置的数据质量优于手腕，反射式脉搏血氧仪在便携式SA监测中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Sleep apnea (SA) is a chronic sleep-related disorder consisting of repetitive
pauses or restrictions in airflow during sleep and is known to be a risk factor
for cerebro- and cardiovascular disease. It is generally diagnosed using
polysomnography (PSG) recorded overnight in an in-lab setting at the hospital.
This includes the measurement of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), which exhibits
fluctuations caused by SA events. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy
and utility of reflectance pulse oximetry from a wearable device as a means to
continuously monitor SpO2 during sleep. To this end, we analyzed data from a
cohort of 134 patients with suspected SA undergoing overnight PSG and wearing
the watch-like device at two measurement locations (upper arm and wrist). Our
data show that standard requirements for pulse oximetry measurements are met at
both measurement locations, with an accuracy (root mean squared error) of 1.9%
at the upper arm and 3.2% at the wrist. With a rejection rate of 3.1%, the
upper arm yielded better results in terms of data quality when compared to the
wrist location which had 30.4% of data rejected.

TL;DR: 本文研究了分布式MIMO LEO卫星网络中信道估计误差和Rician因子对数据速率的影响，提出了一种结合用户调度、功率控制和动态带宽分配的优化方法，以最大化总数据速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于资源分配问题的复杂性，如何在分布式MIMO LEO卫星网络中最大化总数据速率是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 通过MMSE估计量化信道误差，推导数据速率的下界，并将问题分解为用户调度、联合组合与功率控制、动态带宽分配三个子问题，采用AO优化方法，结合图着色、SCA和GP等技术求解。

Result: 数值结果验证了所推导下界的紧密度，特别是在大Rician因子下，性能显著优于其他基准方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在分布式MIMO LEO卫星网络中实现了高效资源分配，显著提升了总数据速率。

Abstract: This paper characterizes the impacts of channel estimation errors and Rician
factors on achievable data rate and investigates the user scheduling strategy,
combining scheme, power control, and dynamic bandwidth allocation to maximize
the sum data rate in the distributed multiple-input-multiple-output
(MIMO)-enabled low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks. However, due to the
resource-assignment problem, it is challenging to find the optimal solution for
maximizing the sum data rate. To transform this problem into a more tractable
form, we first quantify the channel estimation errors based on the minimum mean
square error (MMSE) estimator and rigorously derive a closed-form lower bound
of the achievable data rate, offering an explicit formulation for resource
allocation. Then, to solve the NP-hard problem, we decompose it into three
sub-problems, namely, user scheduling strategy, joint combination and power
control, and dynamic bandwidth allocation, by using alternative optimization
(AO). Specifically, the user scheduling is formulated as a graph coloring
problem by iteratively updating an undirected graph based on user requirements,
which is then solved using the DSatur algorithm. For the combining weights and
power control, the successive convex approximation (SCA) and geometrical
programming (GP) are adopted to obtain the sub-optimal solution with lower
complexity. Finally, the optimal bandwidth allocation can be achieved by
solving the concave problem.
  Numerical results validate the analytical tightness of the derived bound,
especially for large Rician factors, and demonstrate significant performance
gains over other benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的方案，用于重构三维（3D）移动区域内的小尺度信道图，显著降低了信道估计的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动天线（MA）能通过局部移动重构无线信道，但确定最优天线位置需要整个区域的信道状态信息（CSI），即小尺度信道图。传统的穷举式信道估计方法开销过大，亟需高效解决方案。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方案能准确重构小尺度信道图，且性能优于其他基准方案。

Conclusion: 基于CNN的信道图重构方案有效降低了开销，为MA技术的实际应用提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has attracted increasing attention in wireless
communications due to its capability of wireless channel reconfiguration
through local antenna movement within a confined region at the
transmitter/receiver. However, to determine the optimal antenna positions,
channel state information (CSI) within the entire region, termed small-scale
channel map, is required, which poses a significant challenge due to the
unaffordable overhead for exhaustive channel estimation at all positions. To
tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new convolutional neural
network (CNN)-based estimation scheme to reconstruct the small-scale channel
map within a three-dimensional (3D) movement region. Specifically, we first
collect a set of CSI measurements corresponding to a subset of MA positions and
different receiver locations offline to comprehensively capture the
environmental features. Subsequently, we train a CNN using the collected data,
which is then used to reconstruct the full channel map during real-time
transmission only based on a finite number of channel measurements taken at
several selected MA positions within the 3D movement region. Numerical results
demonstrate that our proposed scheme can accurately reconstruct the small-scale
channel map and outperforms other benchmark schemes.

Abstract: This work investigates Distributed Detection (DD) in Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSNs) utilizing channel-aware binary-decision fusion over a shared flat-fading
channel. A reconfigurable metasurface, positioned in the near-field of a
limited number of receive antennas, is integrated to enable a holographic
Decision Fusion (DF) system. This approach minimizes the need for multiple RF
chains while leveraging the benefits of a large array. The optimal fusion rule
for a fixed metasurface configuration is derived, alongside two suboptimal
joint fusion rule and metasurface design strategies. These suboptimal
approaches strike a balance between reduced complexity and lower system
knowledge requirements, making them practical alternatives. The design
objective focuses on effectively conveying the information regarding the
phenomenon of interest to the FC while promoting energy-efficient data
analytics aligned with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Simulation
results underscore the viability of holographic DF, demonstrating its
advantages even with suboptimal designs and highlighting the significant
energy-efficiency gains achieved by the proposed system.

accuracy, and robustness trade-offs, limiting their practicality for UAV
navigation. This paper proposes CiUAV, a novel 3D indoor localization system
designed for UAVs, leveraging channel state information (CSI) obtained from
low-cost ESP32 IoT-based sensors. The system incorporates a dynamic automatic
gain control (AGC) compensation algorithm to mitigate noise and stabilize CSI
signals, significantly enhancing the robustness of the measurement.
Additionally, a multi-task 3D localization model, Sensor-in-Sample (SiS), is
introduced to enhance system robustness by addressing challenges related to
incomplete sensor data and limited training samples. SiS achieves this by joint
training with varying sensor configurations and sample sizes, ensuring reliable
performance even in resource-constrained scenarios. Experiment results
demonstrate that CiUAV achieves a LMSE localization error of 0.2629 m in a 3D
space, achieving good accuracy and robustness. The proposed system provides a
cost-effective and scalable solution, demonstrating its usefulness for UAV
applications in resource-constrained indoor environments.

TL;DR: CS-SFIM技术利用压缩感知和空频索引调制，提升大规模多用户MIMO上行链路的性能，通过AMP和EP算法降低检测复杂度，并引入GNN进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模多用户MIMO上行链路中，多用户干扰严重，传统检测方法复杂度高，需设计高效且低复杂度的检测方案。

Method: 提出CS-SFIM框架，将比特映射到空频域，基于因子图的AMP和EP检测，进一步设计GNN驱动的OAMP和EP检测器（GNN-AMP、GEPNet）。

Result: GNN检测器在多种配置下接近ML性能，复杂度显著降低，GEPNet实现最佳性能，GNN-AMP平衡性能与复杂度。

Conclusion: CS-SFIM及GNN检测器在大规模场景中高效且可扩展，为未来网络提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The concept of Compressed Sensing-aided Space-Frequency Index Modulation
(CS-SFIM) is conceived for the Large-Scale Multi-User Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output Uplink (LS-MU-MIMO-UL) of Next-Generation (NG) networks.
Explicitly, in CS-SFIM, the information bits are mapped to both spatial- and
frequency-domain indices, where we treat the activation patterns of the
transmit antennas and of the subcarriers separately. Serving a large number of
users in an MU-MIMO-UL system leads to substantial Multi-User Interference
(MUI). Hence, we design the Space-Frequency (SF) domain matrix as a joint
factor graph, where the Approximate Message Passing (AMP) and Expectation
Propagation (EP) based MU detectors can be utilized. In the LS-MU-MIMO-UL
scenario considered, the proposed system uses optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML)
and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detectors as benchmarks for comparison
with the proposed MP-based detectors. These MP-based detectors significantly
reduce the detection complexity compared to ML detection, making the design
eminently suitable for LS-MU scenarios. To further reduce the detection
complexity and improve the detection performance, we propose a pair of Graph
Neural Network (GNN) based detectors, which rely on the orthogonal AMP (OAMP)
and on the EP algorithm, which we refer to as the GNN-AMP and GEPNet detectors,
respectively. The GEPNet detector maximizes the detection performance, while
the GNN-AMP detector strikes a performance versus complexity trade-off. The GNN
is trained for a single system configuration and yet it can be used for any
number of users in the system. The simulation results show that the GNN-based
detector approaches the ML performance in various configurations.

Motivation: 多参考对齐模型在信号处理、计算成像和结构生物学中至关重要，但EM算法在低SNR下的实际性能缺乏深入理解。

Method: 详细分析了低SNR下EM的两种失败模式，并通过理论分析和数值实验支持发现。提出基于小批量的改进EM方法，减少初始偏差和计算成本。

Conclusion: 本研究为低SNR下EM算法的局限性提供了理论解释，并提出了一种简单有效的改进方案，对该领域的算法设计具有指导意义。

Abstract: We study the multi-reference alignment model, which involves recovering a
signal from noisy observations that have been randomly transformed by an
unknown group action, a fundamental challenge in statistical signal processing,
computational imaging, and structural biology. While much of the theoretical
literature has focused on the asymptotic sample complexity of this model, the
practical performance of reconstruction algorithms, particularly of the
omnipresent expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, remains poorly understood.
  In this work, we present a detailed investigation of EM in the challenging
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We identify and characterize two
failure modes that emerge in this setting. The first, called Einstein from
Noise, reveals a strong sensitivity to initialization, with reconstructions
resembling the input template regardless of the true underlying signal. The
second phenomenon, referred to as the Ghost of Newton, involves EM initially
converging towards the correct solution but later diverging, leading to a loss
of reconstruction fidelity. We provide theoretical insights and support our
findings through numerical experiments. Finally, we introduce a simple, yet
effective modification to EM based on mini-batching, which mitigates the above
artifacts. Supported by both theory and experiments, this mini-batching
approach processes small data subsets per iteration, reducing initialization
bias and computational cost, while maintaining accuracy comparable to
full-batch EM.

Motivation: 由于传统的iPSC-CMs成熟度评估方法耗时且可能损坏样本，研究者开发了一种无损伤、自动化的方法以优化实验流程和结果的一致性。

Method: 研究利用视频运动分析提取10个特征，结合支持向量机（SVM）分类器，并通过SHAP分析确定关键特征。模型的超参数通过网格搜索和交叉验证优化。

Result: 优化后的模型在测试集上取得了99.5±1.1%的准确率，位移、舒张上升时间和跳动持续时间被确定为评估成熟度的关键指标。

Conclusion: 该方法为非侵入性评估iPSC-CMs成熟度提供了高效工具，有望减少实验变异性并提升结果可重复性。

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) are an
important resource for the identification of new therapeutic targets and
cardioprotective drugs. After differentiation iPSC-CMs show an immature,
fetal-like phenotype. Cultivation of iPSC-CMs in lipid-supplemented maturation
medium (MM) strongly enhances their structural, metabolic and functional
phenotype. Nevertheless, assessing iPSC-CM maturation state remains challenging
as most methods are time consuming and go in line with cell damage or loss of
the sample. To address this issue, we developed a non-invasive approach for
automated classification of iPSC-CM maturity through interpretable artificial
intelligence (AI)-based analysis of beat characteristics derived from
video-based motion analysis. In a prospective study, we evaluated 230 video
recordings of early-state, immature iPSC-CMs on day 21 after differentiation
(d21) and more mature iPSC-CMs cultured in MM (d42, MM). For each recording, 10
features were extracted using Maia motion analysis software and entered into a
support vector machine (SVM). The hyperparameters of the SVM were optimized in
a grid search on 80 % of the data using 5-fold cross-validation. The optimized
model achieved an accuracy of 99.5 $\pm$ 1.1 % on a hold-out test set. Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified displacement, relaxation-rise time and
beating duration as the most relevant features for assessing maturity level.
Our results suggest the use of non-invasive, optical motion analysis combined
with AI-based methods as a tool to assess iPSC-CMs maturity and could be
applied before performing functional readouts or drug testing. This may
potentially reduce the variability and improve the reproducibility of
experimental studies.

Abstract: Controllable emotional voice conversion (EVC) aims to manipulate emotional
expressions to increase the diversity of synthesized speech. Existing methods
typically rely on predefined labels, reference audios, or prespecified factor
values, often overlooking individual differences in emotion perception and
expression. In this paper, we introduce PromptEVC that utilizes natural
language prompts for precise and flexible emotion control. To bridge text
descriptions with emotional speech, we propose emotion descriptor and prompt
mapper to generate fine-grained emotion embeddings, trained jointly with
reference embeddings. To enhance naturalness, we present a prosody modeling and
control pipeline that adjusts the rhythm based on linguistic content and
emotional cues. Additionally, a speaker encoder is incorporated to preserve
identity. Experimental results demonstrate that PromptEVC outperforms
state-of-the-art controllable EVC methods in emotion conversion, intensity
control, mixed emotion synthesis, and prosody manipulation. Speech samples are

Abstract: Polarforming emerges as a promising technique for manipulating the
polarization of electromagnetic (EM) waves by shaping the polarization of an
antenna into a desired state. By dynamically adjusting antenna polarization,
polarforming enables real-time polarization matching or mismatching with
received EM waves, thereby leveraging polarization degrees of freedom (DoFs) to
enhance wireless communication performance. In this article, we first present
an overview of the fundamental principles and design approaches underlying the
polarforming technique. We then analyze the key advantages of polarforming,
including hardware cost reduction, depolarization mitigation, channel
adaptation, signal power enhancement, and interference suppression.
Furthermore, we explore promising applications of polarforming for
next-generation wireless networks. Numerical case studies demonstrate the
substantial performance gains of polarforming over conventional
fixed-polarization antenna (FPA) systems, along with a discussion of
implementation challenges to motivate future research.

Conclusion: 该方法强调雷达检测阈值和信号处理算法设计应基于尾部行为和百分位保证，而不仅仅是平均性能，这对新兴高可靠性应用至关重要。

Abstract: We present a novel analytical framework to characterize the distribution of
the conditional receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in radar systems
operating within a realization of a Poisson field of interferers and clutters.
While conventional stochastic geometry based studies focus on the distribution
of signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR), they fail to capture the
statistical variations in detection and false-alarm performance across
different network realizations. By leveraging higher-order versions of the
Campbell-Mecke theorem and tools from stochastic geometry, we derive
closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the conditional
false-alarm probability, and provide tight upper bounds using Cantelli's
inequality. Additionally, we present a beta distribution approximation to
capture the meta-distribution of the noise and interference power, enabling
fine-grained performance evaluation. The results are extended to analyze the
conditional detection probability, albeit with simpler bounds. Our approach
reveals a new approach to radar design and robust ROC selection, including
percentile-level guarantees, which are essential for emerging high-reliability
applications. The insights derived here advocate for designing radar detection
thresholds and signal processing algorithms based not merely on mean
false-alarm or detection probabilities, but on tail behavior and percentile
guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于RIS作为近乎被动的反射超表面，无法区分有用信号和干扰信号，可能引起严重的频谱污染甚至负面影响性能。尤其在大型网络中，来自RIS的过多干扰会降低接收节点的SINR。

Method: 提出了TPC算法，结合LSTM预测用户轨迹，并通过码本算法自适应协调RIS单元的配置。

Result: 仿真结果显示，TPC方法在多种系统设置下均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: TPC算法能有效优化RIS配置，显著提升接收SINR，为RIS的动态控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have demonstrated an unparalleled
ability to reconfigure wireless environments by dynamically controlling the
phase, amplitude, and polarization of impinging waves. However, as nearly
passive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and
interference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even
affect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be
degraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based
dynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence,
integrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user
trajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS
controller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to
maximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed TPC method over various system settings.

Motivation: 随着高带宽、低延迟应用需求的增长，共享光频谱资源（OSaaS）带来了网络干扰问题，需快速检测干扰以减少系统中断和修复成本。

Method: 提出一种基于机器学习的架构，利用粗略功率测量和运营商信道性能数据，无需用户内部频谱信息，即可检测并定位干扰源。

Result: 在190公里光纤系统和三个OSaaS用户的实验中，模型实现了90.3%的干扰源分类准确率。

Conclusion: 该方案为网络运营商提供了一种高效且无需用户内部数据的干扰检测方法。

Abstract: With the growing demand for high-bandwidth, low-latency applications, Optical
Spectrum as a Service (OSaaS) is of interest for flexible bandwidth allocation
within Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) and Open Line Systems (OLS). While OSaaS
facilitates transparent connectivity and resource sharing among users, it
raises concerns over potential network vulnerabilities due to shared fiber
access and inter-channel interference, such as fiber non-linearity and
amplifier based crosstalk. These challenges are exacerbated in multi-user
environments, complicating the identification and localization of service
interferences. To reduce system disruptions and system repair costs, it is
beneficial to detect and identify such interferences timely. Addressing these
challenges, this paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) based architecture
for network operators to detect and attribute interferences to specific OSaaS
users while blind to the users' internal spectrum details. Our methodology
leverages available coarse power measurements and operator channel performance
data, bypassing the need for internal user information of wide-band shared
spectra. Experimental studies conducted on a 190 km optical line system in the
Open Ireland testbed, with three OSaaS users demonstrate the model's capability
to accurately classify the source of interferences, achieving a classification
accuracy of 90.3%.

Abstract: With the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, there is a
necessity for advanced technologies that can provide reliable situational
awareness and communication. Conventional systems are often inadequate due to
unreliable infrastructure, power grid failures, high investment costs and
scalability challenges. This paper explores the potential of ad-hoc mesh joint
radar and communication (JRC) networks as a scalable, resilient,
energy-efficient solution for disaster management that can operate
independently of conventional infrastructure. The proposed JRC network enhances
disaster response by integrating target detection (such as identifying vital
signs, hazardous leaks, and fires) with communication capabilities to ensure
efficient information dissemination under intense clutter conditions. Key
performance metrics, including data rate, Signal-to-Clutter and Noise Ratio
(SCNR), probability of detection, and false alarm rate, are used to assess
performance. An optimization approach is proposed to provide an
energy-efficient resource allocation scheme. The results show the performance
of ad-hoc mesh JRC systems, underscoring their potential to enhance disaster
management efforts by addressing unique operational challenges.

Abstract: Accurate 3D localization is essential for realizing advanced sensing
functionalities in next-generation Wi-Fi communication systems. This study
investigates the potential of multistatic localization in Wi-Fi networks
through the deployment of multiple cooperative antenna arrays. The
collaborative gain offered by these arrays is twofold: (i) intra-array coherent
gain at the wavelength scale among antenna elements, and (ii) inter-array
cooperative gain across arrays. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of
this approach, we develop WiCAL (Wi-Fi Collaborative Antenna Localization), a
system built upon commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure equipped with uniform
rectangular arrays. These arrays are driven by multiplexing embedded radio
frequency chains available in standard access points or user devices, thereby
eliminating the need for sophisticated, costly, and power-hungry
multi-transceiver modules typically required in multiple-input and
multiple-output systems. To address phase offsets introduced by RF chain
multiplexing, we propose a three-stage, fine-grained phase alignment scheme to
synchronize signals across antenna elements within each array. A bidirectional
spatial smoothing MUSIC algorithm is employed to estimate angles of arrival
(AoAs) and mitigate performance degradation caused by correlated interference.
To further exploit inter-array cooperative gain, we elaborate on the
synchronization mechanism among distributed URAs, which enables direct position
determination by bypassing intermediate angle estimation. Once synchronized,
the distributed URAs effectively form a virtual large-scale array,
significantly enhancing spatial resolution and localization accuracy.

Method: 提出“Model as Loss”范式，利用模型的编码器任务特定特征空间作为损失函数，优化解码器输出与干净信号在感知和任务相关特性上的一致性。

Result: 该方法在标准语音增强基准测试中优于预训练的深度特征损失，提供了更好的感知质量和鲁棒的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Model as Loss框架通过自一致性实现了更优的语音增强性能，尤其在感知质量和泛化能力上表现突出。

Abstract: Conventional methods for speech enhancement rely on handcrafted loss
functions (e.g., time or frequency domain losses) or deep feature losses (e.g.,
using WavLM or wav2vec), which often fail to capture subtle signal properties
essential for optimal performance. To address this, we propose Model as Loss, a
novel training paradigm that utilizes the encoder from the same model as a loss
function to guide the training.
  The Model as Loss paradigm leverages the encoder's task-specific feature
space, optimizing the decoder to produce output consistent with perceptual and
task-relevant characteristics of the clean signal. By using the encoder's
learned features as a loss function, this framework enforces self-consistency
between the clean reference speech and the enhanced model output. Our approach
outperforms pre-trained deep feature losses on standard speech enhancement
benchmarks, offering better perceptual quality and robust generalization to
both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Abstract: Scattering Networks were initially designed to elucidate the behavior of
early layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over Euclidean spaces and
are grounded in wavelets. In this work, we introduce a scattering transform on
an arbitrary finite group (not necessarily abelian) within the context of
group-equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs). We present wavelets
on finite groups and analyze their similarity to classical wavelets. We
demonstrate that, under certain conditions in the wavelet coefficients, the
scattering transform is non-expansive, stable under deformations, preserves
energy, equivariant with respect to left and right group translations, and, as
depth increases, the scattering coefficients are less sensitive to group
translations of the signal, all desirable properties of convolutional neural
networks. Furthermore, we provide examples illustrating the application of the
scattering transform to classify data with domains involving abelian and
nonabelian groups.
