Haptic feedback from contacts with the environment is only\nsecondary if present at all. In this work, we explored an extreme case of\nsearching for and grasping objects in complete absence of visual input, relying\non haptic feedback only. The main novelty lies in the use of contacts over the\ncomplete surface of a robot manipulator covered with sensitive skin. The search\nis divided into two phases: (1) coarse workspace exploration with the complete\nrobot surface, followed by (2) precise localization using the end-effector\nequipped with a force/torque sensor. We systematically evaluated this method in\nsimulation and on the real robot, demonstrating that diverse objects can be\nlocated, grasped, and put in a basket. The overall success rate on the real\nrobot for one object was 85.7\\% with failures mainly while grasping specific\nobjects. The method using whole-body contacts is six times faster compared to a\nbaseline that uses haptic feedback only on the end-effector. We also show\nlocating and grasping multiple objects on the table. This method is not\nrestricted to our specific setup and can be deployed on any platform with the\nability of sensing contacts over the entire body surface.

To overcome this, in this\nwork we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines\nprocedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages\nBlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and\ncontrolled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2\nworld-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with\ntemporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We\ndemonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,\nblending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance\ncompared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1\nmixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the\nreal-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first\napproach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing\nreliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained\nindustrial applications."}

While typically considered\ncyber-physical systems (CPSs), their dependence on traditional networked\nsoftware stacks (e.g., Linux operating systems), robot operating system (ROS)\nmiddleware, and over-the-air update channels, creates a distinct security\nprofile that exposes them to vulnerabilities conventional CPS models do not\nfully address. Prior studies have mainly examined specific threats, such as\nLiDAR spoofing or adversarial machine learning (AML). This narrow focus\noverlooks how an attack targeting one component can cascade harm throughout the\nrobot's interconnected systems. We address this gap through a systematization\nof knowledge (SoK) that takes a comprehensive approach, consolidating\nfragmented research from robotics, CPS, and network security domains. We\nintroduce a seven-layer security model for humanoid robots, organizing 39 known\nattacks and 35 defenses across the humanoid ecosystem-from hardware to\nhuman-robot interaction. Building on this security model, we develop a\nquantitative 39x35 attack-defense matrix with risk-weighted scoring, validated\nthrough Monte Carlo analysis. We demonstrate our method by evaluating three\nreal-world robots: Pepper, G1 EDU, and Digit. The scoring analysis revealed\nvarying security maturity levels, with scores ranging from 39.9% to 79.5%\nacross the platforms. This work introduces a structured, evidence-based\nassessment method that enables systematic security evaluation, supports\ncross-platform benchmarking, and guides prioritization of security investments\nin humanoid robotics."}

Replicating such capabilities in synthetic active\nmatter remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic\nactive particles can adapt to hidden hydrodynamic perturbations through\nphysical embodiment alone, without explicit sensing mechanisms. Using\nreinforcement learning to control self-thermophoretic particles, we show that\nthey learn navigation strategies to counteract unobserved flow fields by\nexploiting information encoded in their physical dynamics. Remarkably,\nparticles successfully navigate perturbations that are not included in their\nstate inputs, revealing that embodied dynamics can serve as an implicit sensing\nmechanism. This discovery establishes physical embodiment as a computational\nresource for information processing in active matter, with implications for\nautonomous microrobotic systems and bio-inspired computation."}

However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has\nbeen less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF\nis a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To\nimprove the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,\nLLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for\nMAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained\ngraph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the\nfirst work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs\nwith the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior\nperformance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both\nsimulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly\noutperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems."}
