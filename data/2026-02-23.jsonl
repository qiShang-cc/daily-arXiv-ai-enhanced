This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of deep neural network architectures for automated arrhythmia classification, integrating temporal modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble strategies. To address data scarcity in minority classes, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset was augmented using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We developed and compared four distinct architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), CNN combined with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), CNN-LSTM with Attention, and 1D Residual Networks (ResNet-1D), to capture both local morphological features and long-term temporal dependencies. Performance was rigorously evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) with 95\\% confidence intervals to ensure statistical robustness, while Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to validate model interpretability. Experimental results indicate that the CNN-LSTM model achieved the optimal stand-alone balance between sensitivity and specificity, yielding an F1-score of 0.951. Conversely, the CNN-LSTM-Attention and ResNet-1D models exhibited higher sensitivity to class imbalance. To mitigate this, a dynamic ensemble fusion strategy was introduced; specifically, the Top2-Weighted ensemble achieved the highest overall performance with an F1-score of 0.958. These findings demonstrate that leveraging complementary deep architectures significantly enhances classification reliability, providing a robust and interpretable foundation for intelligent arrhythmia detection systems."}

Existing approaches aim to improve diversity in training partners to approximate human behavior, but these partners are static and fail to capture adaptive behavior of humans. Exposing robots to adaptive behaviors is critical, yet when both agents learn simultaneously in a multi-agent setting, they often converge to opaque implicit coordination strategies that only work with the agents they were co-trained with. Such agents fail to generalize when paired with new partners. In order to capture the adaptive behavior of humans, we model the human-robot teaming scenario as an Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP), explicitly modeling human adaptation as part of the state. We propose a nested training regime to approximately learn the solution to a finite-level I-POMDP. In this framework, agents at each level are trained against adaptive agents from the level below. This ensures that the ego agent is exposed to adaptive behavior during training while avoiding the emergence of implicit coordination strategies, since the training partners are not themselves learning. We train our method in a multi-episode, required cooperation setup in the Overcooked domain, comparing it against several baseline agents designed for human-robot teaming. We evaluate the performance of our agent when paired with adaptive partners that were not seen during training. Our results demonstrate that our agent not only achieves higher task performance with these adaptive partners but also exhibits significantly greater adaptability during team interactions."}

In pilot-aided transmission (PAT), a non-negligible fraction of the packet is consumed by pilots, creating a direct pre-log loss and tightening the reliability margin needed for ultra-reliable low-latency communication. We propose a pilot-free polar-coded framework that replaces explicit pilots with \\emph{coded pilots}. The message is carried by two polar-coded segments: a quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) segment that is decodable without channel state information (CSI), and a higher-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) segment that provides high spectral efficiency. The receiver employs \\emph{hybrid decoding}: it first jointly infers CSI during successive-cancellation-based decoding of the QPSK segment by exploiting QPSK phase-rotation invariance together with polar frozen-bit constraints; the decoded QPSK symbols then act as \\emph{implicit pilots} for coherent detection and decoding of the QAM segment. The split also makes rate adaptation practical by confining the symmetry/frozen-bit requirements for phase resolution to the QPSK segment, enabling puncturing and shortening without breaking the pilot-free mechanism. For multi-block fading, we optimize the split and code parameters via density evolution with Gaussian approximation (DEGA); for higher-order modulation, we use bit-interleaved coded modulation capacity approximation to obtain equivalent channel parameters. Incorporating channel-estimation error variance into the DEGA-based analysis, simulations over practical multi-block block-fading channels show gains up to $1.5$~dB over PAT in the short-blocklength regime."}

Reducing the physical demands of this task through intelligent and personalized assistance has significant implications, particularly in industries involving repetitive low-level assembly activities. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a neural network controller for a modular Hip-Knee exoskeleton designed to assist squatting tasks. The neural network controller was trained via reinforcement learning (RL) in a physics-based, human-exoskeleton interaction simulation environment. The controller generated real-time hip and knee assistance torques based on recent joint-angle and velocity histories. Five healthy adults performed three-minute metronome-guided squats under three conditions: (1) no exoskeleton (No-Exo), (2) exoskeleton with Zero-Torque, and (3) exoskeleton with active assistance (Assistance). Physiological effort was assessed using indirect calorimetry and heart rate monitoring, alongside concurrent kinematic data collection. Results show that the RL-based controller adapts to individuals by producing torque profiles tailored to each subject's kinematics and timing. Compared with the Zero-Torque and No-Exo condition, active assistance reduced the net metabolic rate by approximately 10%, with minor reductions observed in heart rate. However, assisted trials also exhibited reduced squat depth, reflected by smaller hip and knee flexion. These preliminary findings suggest that the proposed controller can effectively lower physiological effort during repetitive squatting, motivating further improvements in both hardware design and control strategies."}

Meanwhile, a geometry-driven physical baseline is introduced to decouple deterministic attenuation trends from stochastic residual variations. A vehicular multi-modal path loss dataset (VMMPL) is constructed, which covers three representative scenarios, including the urban wide lane, urban crossroad, and suburban forking road environments, and achieves precise alignment between RGB images and global semantic information in the physical space, and link-level ray-tracing (RT)-based path loss data in the electromagnetic space.

Due to the high-speed user mobility, the multi-user tracking and signal detection performance can be significantly deteriorated without elaborated online user kinematic state updating principles. To tackle this challenge, we first manage to establish a probabilistic signal model to comprehensively characterize the interdependencies among user states, transmit signals, and received signals during the tracking procedure. Based on the Bayesian problem formulation, we further propose a novel hybrid variational message passing (HVMP) algorithm to realize computationally efficient joint estimation of user states and transmit signals in an online manner, which integrates VMP and standard MP to derive the posterior probabilities of estimated variables. Furthermore, the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound is provided to characterize the performance limit of the multi-user tracking problem, which is also utilized to optimize RIS phase profiles for tracking performance enhancement. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve both tracking and signal detection performance over the representative Bayesian estimation counterparts."}

The system operates in a hybrid near-/far-field regime. The transmitter (Tx) operates in the far field (FF) and uses low-complexity beam steering. The receiver (Rx), on the other hand, operates in a pervasive near field (NF), enabled by a very large effective array aperture. To enable a fully digital implementation, we introduce an extremely large antenna spacing (ELAS) design. This design attains the required aperture with only a few widely spaced antenna elements while avoiding grating lobes in the composite Tx-Rx response. We analytically characterize the NF range-angle response of this architecture and study the interplay between NF effects and waveform bandwidth. This leads to the definition of a super-resolution region, where NF propagation at the Rx dominates the achievable range resolution and surpasses the classical, bandwidth-limited resolution. As a case study, we consider an extended target modeled as a collection of scatterers and assess localization performance via maximum-likelihood estimation. Numerical results evaluated in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) show that operating in NF conditions with the ELAS-based design yields significant gains compared to a conventional FF baseline at both the Tx and Rx."}

This paper examines multipath delay estimation for Wi-Fi-compliant multiband configurations using channel state information (CSI). For a two-path model with unknown complex gains and delays, the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for delay separation is derived and analyzed, confirming the benefit of larger frequency aperture, while revealing pronounced, separation-dependent oscillations driven by gap geometry and inter-path coupling. Given the local nature of Cramér-Rao lower bound, the delay response is analyzed next. In the single-path case, the combined subband responses determine how delay-domain sidelobe levels are distributed. The dominant peak spacing is set primarily by the separation between subband center frequencies. In the two-path case, increased aperture sharpens the mainlobe but also intensifies sidelobes and leakage, yielding competing peaks and, in some regimes, a dominant peak shifted from the true delay. Finally, a normalized leakage metric is introduced to predict problematic separations and to identify regimes where local Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis does not capture practical peak-leakage behavior in delay estimation."}

Under this model, the tracking lost issue arising from the misalignment between the pencil-like beams and the true target positions is inevitable, especially when the trajectories of the targets are complex, and the conventional Kalman filter-based scheme does not work well. To deal with this issue, we propose a Transformer-based mmWave multi-target tracking framework, namely m3TrackFormer, with a novel re-acquisition mechanism, such that even if the echo signals from some targets are too weak to extract sensing information, we are able to re-acquire their locations quickly with small beam sweeping overhead. Specifically, the proposed framework can operate in two modes of normal tracking and target re-acquisition during the tracking procedure, depending on whether the tracking lost occurs. When all targets are hit by the swept beams, the framework works in the Normal Tracking Mode (N-Mode) with a Transformer encoder-based Normal Tracking Network (N-Net) to accurately estimate the positions of these targets and predict the swept beams in the next time block. While the tracking lost happens, the framework will switch to the Re-Acquisition Mode (R-Mode) with a Transformer decoder-based Re-Acquisition Network (RNet) to adjust the beam sweeping strategy for getting back the lost targets and maintaining the tracking of the remaining targets. Thanks to the ability of global trajectory feature extraction, the m3TrackFormer can achieve high beam prediction accuracy and quickly re-acquire the lost targets, compared with other tracking methods."}

However, for multi-modal motion models the notion of information gain is often ill-defined. This paper proposes a planning approach designed around maximising information regarding the target's homotopy class, or high-level motion. We introduce homotopic information gain, a measure of the expected high-level trajectory information given by a measurement. We show that homotopic information gain is a lower bound for metric or low-level information gain, and is as sparsely distributed in the environment as obstacles are. Planning sensing trajectories to maximise homotopic information results in highly accurate trajectory estimates with fewer measurements than a metric information approach, as supported by our empirical evaluation on real and simulated pedestrian data."}

In this paper, we propose an efficient channel estimation framework for double-BD-RIS-assisted multi-user multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, we reveal that high-dimensional cascaded channels are characterized by five low-dimensional matrices by exploiting channel correlation properties. Based on this novel observation, in the ideal noiseless case, we develop a channel estimation scheme to recover these matrices sequentially and characterize the closed-form overhead required for perfect estimation as a function of the numbers of users and each BD-RIS's elements and channel ranks, which is with the same order as that in double-diagonal-RIS-aided communication systems. This exciting result implies the superiority of cooperative BD-RIS-aided communication over the diagonal- RIS counterpart even when channel estimation overhead is considered.

Iterative learning control (ILC) improves performance by using information from previous iterations to compensate for expected errors in future iterations. This work incorporates the use of Quasi-Periodic Gaussian Processes (QPGPs) into a predictive ILC framework to model and forecast disturbances and drift across iterations. Using a recent structural equation formulation of QPGPs, the proposed approach enables efficient inference with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}(i^2p^3)$, where $p$ denotes the number of points within an iteration and $i$ represents the total number of iterations, specially for larger $i$. This formulation also enables parameter estimation without loss of information, making continual GP learning computationally feasible within the control loop. By predicting next-iteration error profiles rather than relying only on past errors, the controller achieves faster convergence and maintains this under time-varying disturbances. We benchmark the method against both standard ILC and conventional Gaussian Process (GP)-based predictive ILC on three tasks, autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking, a three-link robotic manipulator, and a real-world Stretch robot experiment.

The MD-AirComp scheme has proven effective in federated edge learning and is highly compatible with current digital wireless networks. However, it depends on channel pre-equalization, which may amplify computation errors in the presence of channel estimation inaccuracies, thus limiting its practical use. In this paper, we propose a blind MD-AirComp+ scheme, which takes advantage of the channel hardening effect in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We provide an upper bound on the computation mean square error, analyze the trade-off between computation accuracy and communication overhead, and determine the optimal quantization level. Additionally, we introduce a deep unfolding algorithm to reduce the computational complexity of solving the underdetermined detection problem formulated as a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator optimization problem. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed MD-AirComp+ framework, the optimal quantization selection strategy, and the low-complexity detection algorithm."}

Inspired by this capability, we study long-horizon multi-object non-prehensile rearrangement for mobile robots using a single egocentric camera. We introduce EgoPush, a policy learning framework that enables egocentric, perception-driven rearrangement without relying on explicit global state estimation that often fails in dynamic scenes. EgoPush designs an object-centric latent space to encode relative spatial relations among objects, rather than absolute poses. This design enables a privileged reinforcement-learning (RL) teacher to jointly learn latent states and mobile actions from sparse keypoints, which is then distilled into a purely visual student policy. To reduce the supervision gap between the omniscient teacher and the partially observed student, we restrict the teacher's observations to visually accessible cues. This induces active perception behaviors that are recoverable from the student's viewpoint. To address long-horizon credit assignment, we decompose rearrangement into stage-level subproblems using temporally decayed, stage-local completion rewards. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that EgoPush significantly outperforms end-to-end RL baselines in success rate, with ablation studies validating each design choice. We further demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a mobile platform in the real world. Code and videos are available at https://ai4ce.github.io/EgoPush/."}

Traditional empirical models often lack environment-awareness, while deep learning approaches are frequently constrained by the scarcity of large-scale training datasets. This work leverages the inherent sparsity of wireless propagation to model scenario-specific channels by identifying a discrete set of virtual signal sources. We propose a novel Greedy Sequential Sparse Bayesian Learning (GS-SBL) framework that bridges the gap between the computational efficiency of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and the robust uncertainty quantification of SBL. Unlike standard top-down SBL, which updates all source hyperparameters simultaneously, our approach employs a ``Micro-SBL'' architecture. We sequentially evaluate candidate source locations in isolation by executing localized, low-iteration SBL loops and selecting the source that minimizes the $L_2$ residual error. Once identified, the source and its corresponding power are added to the support set, and the process repeats on the signal residual to identify subsequent sources. Experimental results on real-world 3D propagation data demonstrate that the GS-SBL framework significantly outperforms OMP in terms of generalization. By utilizing SBL as a sequential source identifier rather than a global optimizer, the proposed method preserves Bayesian high-resolution accuracy while achieving the execution speeds necessary for real-time 3D path loss characterization."}

This approach, however, struggles to handle the mutual dependency between the spatial directivity of source estimation and the spatial resolution of FOA ambisonics data. Our method, named SIRUP, employs a latent diffusion model architecture. Specifically, a variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to learn a compact encoding of the HOA data in a latent space and a diffusion model is then trained to generate the HOA embeddings, conditioned by the FOA data. Experimental results showed that SIRUP achieved a significant improvement compared to FOA systems for steering vector upmixing, source localization, and speech denoising."}

We systematically analyze the vulnerability of state-of-the-art deep monocular visual SLAM systems to scale inconsistency, providing both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

This paper investigates the jamming mitigation by leveraging an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS), where the channel uncertainties are particularly addressed for robust anti-jamming design. Towards this issue, we adopt the Stackelberg game formulation to model the strategic interaction between the legitimate side and the adversary, acting as the leader and follower, respectively. We prove the existence of the game equilibrium and adopt the backward induction method for equilibrium analysis. We first derive the optimal jamming policy as the follower's best response, which is then incorporated into the legitimate-side optimization for robust anti-jamming design. We address the uncertainty issue and reformulate the legitimate-side problem by exploiting the error bounds to combat the worst-case jamming attacks. The problem is decomposed within a block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM) framework to tackle the power allocation, transceiving beamforming, and active reflection, respectively, which are iterated towards the robust jamming mitigation scheme. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in protecting the legitimate transmissions under uncertainties, and the superior performance in terms of jamming mitigation as compared with the baselines."}

This work addresses these constraints through a volume-optimized spindle-shaped angled actuator (SSAA) geometry: by reducing actuator volume by 35.7% (357mL vs. 555mL), the SSAA maintains 94.2% of output torque while achieving 35.2% faster dynamic response compared to uniform cylindrical designs. Building on the SSAA, we develop a curved abduction actuator (CAA) based on the SSAA geometry and a horizontal adduction actuator (HAA) based on the pouch motor principle, integrating both into a dual-DOF textile-based shoulder exosuit (390 g). The exosuit delivers multi-modal assistance spanning shoulder abduction, flexion, and horizontal adduction, depending on the actuation.\n  User studies with 10 healthy participants reveal that the exosuit substantially reduces electromyographic (EMG) activity across both shoulder abduction and flexion tasks. For abduction with HAA only, the exosuit achieved up to 59% muscle activity reduction across seven muscles. For flexion, both the single-actuator configuration (HAA only) and the dual-actuator configuration (HAA,+,CAA) reduced EMG activity by up to 63.7% compared to no assistance. However, the incremental benefit of adding the CAA to existing HAA support was limited in healthy users during flexion, with statistically significant additional reductions observed only in pectoralis major. These experimental findings characterize actuator contributions in healthy users and provide design guidance for multi-DOF exosuit systems."}

Existing approaches address adversarial behavior only in the calibration stage, leaving the learned model susceptible to poisoned updates. In contrast, PRISM-FCP mitigates attacks end-to-end. During training, clients partially share updates by transmitting only $M$ of $D$ parameters per round. This attenuates the expected energy of an adversary's perturbation in the aggregated update by a factor of $M/D$, yielding lower mean-square error (MSE) and tighter prediction intervals. During calibration, clients convert nonconformity scores into characterization vectors, compute distance-based maliciousness scores, and downweight or filter suspected Byzantine contributions before estimating the conformal quantile.

Only a few previous works, often accompanied by additional sensors, utilize lines to compensate for the severe domain discrepancies of event sensors along with unpredictable noise characteristics. We propose a method that can stably extract tracks of varying appearances of lines using a clever algorithmic process that observes multiple representations from various time slices of events, compensating for potential adversaries within the event data. We then propose geometric cost functions that can refine the 3D line maps and camera poses, eliminating projective distortions and depth ambiguities. The 3D line maps are highly compact and can be equipped with our proposed cost function, which can be adapted for any observations that can detect and extract line structures or projections of them, including 3D point cloud maps or image observations. We demonstrate that our formulation is powerful enough to exhibit a significant performance boost in event-based mapping and pose refinement across diverse datasets, and can be flexibly applied to multimodal scenarios.

However, such policies often exploit unnatural high-frequency signals that are unachievable by humans or physical robots, making them poor representations of real-world behaviors. Existing work addresses this issue by adding a reward term that penalizes a large change in actions over time. This term often requires substantial tuning efforts. We propose to use the action Jacobian penalty, which penalizes changes in action with respect to the changes in simulated state directly through auto differentiation. This effectively eliminates unrealistic high-frequency control signals without task specific tuning. While effective, the action Jacobian penalty introduces significant computational overhead when used with traditional fully connected neural network architectures. To mitigate this, we introduce a new architecture called a Linear Policy Net (LPN) that significantly reduces the computational burden for calculating the action Jacobian penalty during training. In addition, a LPN requires no parameter tuning, exhibits faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods, and can be more efficiently queried during inference time compared to a fully connected neural network. We demonstrate that a Linear Policy Net, combined with the action Jacobian penalty, is able to learn policies that generate smooth signals while solving a number of motion imitation tasks with different characteristics, including dynamic motions such as a backflip and various challenging parkour skills. Finally, we apply this approach to create policies for dynamic motions on a physical quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm."}

Demystifying VLA Inference Performance with VLA-Perf", "categories": ["cs.RO"], "comment": null, "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across various embodied AI tasks. While deploying VLA models on real-world robots imposes strict real-time inference constraints, the inference performance landscape of VLA remains poorly understood due to the large combinatorial space of model architectures and inference systems. In this paper, we ask a fundamental research question: How should we design future VLA models and systems to support real-time inference? To address this question, we first introduce VLA-Perf, an analytical performance model that can analyze inference performance for arbitrary combinations of VLA models and inference systems. Using VLA-Perf, we conduct the first systematic study of the VLA inference performance landscape. From a model-design perspective, we examine how inference performance is affected by model scaling, model architectural choices, long-context video inputs, asynchronous inference, and dual-system model pipelines. From the deployment perspective, we analyze where VLA inference should be executed -- on-device, on edge servers, or in the cloud -- and how hardware capability and network performance jointly determine end-to-end latency. By distilling 15 key takeaways from our comprehensive evaluation, we hope this work can provide practical guidance for the design of future VLA models and inference systems."}

In this study, an eccentric dome-shaped snapping actuator is developed to generate controllable asymmetric motion through geometry-induced instability. Finite element simulations and experiments reveal consistent asymmetric deformation and the corresponding pressure characteristics. By coupling four snapping actuators in a pneumatic network, a compact quadrupedal robot achieves coordinated wavelike locomotion using only a single pressure input. The robot exhibits frequency-dependent performance with a maximum speed of 72.78~mm/s at 7.5~Hz. These findings demonstrate the potential of asymmetric snapping mechanisms for physically controlled actuation and lay the groundwork for fully untethered and efficient soft robotic systems."}

However, we observe the known phenomenon that synthetically generated MCQAs are highly susceptible to hidden textual cues that allow models to exploit linguistic patterns rather than visual context. Our results show that a VLM fine-tuned on such data can achieve accuracy comparable to human-validated benchmarks even without visual input. Our proposed method reduces blind accuracy from +66.9% above random to +2.9%, eliminating the vast majority of exploitable textual shortcuts. By decoupling the correct answer from linguistic artifacts and employing a curriculum learning strategy, we force the model to rely on visual grounding, ensuring that performance accurately reflects perceptual understanding."}

Experimental results over 100 test scenarios demonstrate that Masked PPO achieves superior mission efficiency and computational performance, visiting up to twice as many debris as Greedy and significantly outperforming MCTS in runtime.

Tasks that are nowadays carried out by the operating stuff, need to be taken over by automatic systems. Therefore, equipment for automatic train operation and observing the environment is needed. Here, an important task is the detection of collisions, including both (1) collisions with the front of the train as well as (2) collisions with the wheel, corresponding to an driving-over event. Technologies for detecting the driving-over events are barely investigated nowadays. Therefore, detailed driving-over experiments were performed to gather knowledge for fully automated rail operations, using a variety of objects made from steel, wood, stone and bones. Based on the captured test data, three methods were developed to detect driving-over events automatically. The first method is based on convolutional neural networks and the other two methods are classical threshold-based approaches. The neural network based approach provides an mean accuracy of 99.6% while the classical approaches show 85% and 88.6%, respectively."}

However, conventional parametric policies often struggle to represent the multi-modality of the solutions. Though diffusion-based policies are aimed at recovering the multi-modality, they lack an explicit probability density, which complicates policy-gradient optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose MePoly, a novel policy parameterization based on polynomial energy-based models. MePoly provides an explicit, tractable probability density, enabling exact entropy maximization. Theoretically, we ground our method in the classical moment problem, leveraging the universal approximation capabilities for arbitrary distributions. Empirically, we demonstrate that MePoly effectively captures complex non-convex manifolds and outperforms baselines in performance across diverse benchmarks."}

However, the use of brain connectomes as neural network controllers in embodied reinforcement learning remains unexplored. We investigate using the exact neural architecture of an adult fruit fly's brain for the control of its body movement. We develop Fly-connectomic Graph Model (FlyGM), whose static structure is identical to the complete connectome of an adult Drosophila for whole-body locomotion control. To perform dynamical control, FlyGM represents the static connectome as a directed message-passing graph to impose a biologically grounded information flow from sensory inputs to motor outputs. Integrated with a biomechanical fruit fly model, our method achieves stable control across diverse locomotion tasks without task-specific architectural tuning. To verify the structural advantages of the connectome-based model, we compare it against a degree-preserving rewired graph, a random graph, and multilayer perceptrons, showing that FlyGM yields higher sample efficiency and superior performance. This work demonstrates that static brain connectomes can be transformed to instantiate effective neural policy for embodied learning of movement control."}

To enhance performance, existing methods often incorporate extra observation cues (e.g., depth maps, point clouds) or auxiliary modules (e.g., object detectors, encoders) to enable more precise and reliable task execution, yet these typically require costly data collection and additional training. Inspired by the finding that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in language models can act as \"key-value memory\", we propose Uncertainty-aware Observation Reinjection (UAOR), an effective, training-free and plug-and-play module for VLA models. Specifically, when the current language model layer exhibits high uncertainty, measured by Action Entropy, it reinjects key observation information into the next layer's Feed-Forward Network (FFN) through attention retrieval. This mechanism helps VLAs better attend to observations during inference, enabling more confident and faithful action generation. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently improves diverse VLA models across simulation and real-world tasks with minimal overhead. Notably, UAOR eliminates the need for additional observation cues or modules, making it a versatile and practical plug-in for existing VLA pipelines.

In this study, we address this issue by uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning. Offline RL leverages both expert and abundant suboptimal data, and cross-embodiment learning aggregates heterogeneous robot trajectories across diverse morphologies to acquire universal control priors. We perform a systematic analysis of this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, providing a principled understanding of its strengths and limitations. To evaluate this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, we construct a suite of locomotion datasets spanning 16 distinct robot platforms. Our experiments confirm that this combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase, we observe that conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning. To mitigate this, we introduce an embodiment-based grouping strategy in which robots are clustered by morphological similarity and the model is updated with a group gradient. This simple, static grouping substantially reduces inter-robot conflicts and outperforms existing conflict-resolution methods."}

The main reason for such ineffectiveness is that once deployed in a system (e.g., within a simulator), attacks tend to be spatially or temporally short-lived, due to the vehicle's dynamics, hence rarely influencing the vehicle behaviour. In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing a system-level attack in which multiple dynamic elements (e.g., two pedestrians) carry adversarial patches (e.g., on cloths) and jointly amplify their effect through coordination and motion. We evaluate our attacks in the CARLA simulator using a state-of-the-art autonomous driving agent. At the system level, single-pedestrian attacks fail in all runs (out of 10), while dynamic collusion by two pedestrians induces full vehicle stops in up to 50\\% of runs, with static collusion yielding no successful attack at all. These results show that system-level failures arise only when adversarial signals persist over time and are amplified through coordinated actors, exposing a gap between model-level robustness and end-to-end safety."}

Recent methods achieve dense reconstructions from da Vinci robotic surgery videos, with Gaussian Splatting (GS) offering real-time performance via graphics acceleration. However, reconstruction quality in occluded regions remains limited, and depth accuracy has not been fully assessed, as benchmarks like EndoNeRF and StereoMIS lack 3D ground truth. We propose Diff2DGS, a novel two-stage framework for reliable 3D reconstruction of occluded surgical scenes. In the first stage, a diffusion-based video module with temporal priors inpaints tissue occluded by instruments with high spatial-temporal consistency. In the second stage, we adapt 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with a Learnable Deformation Model (LDM) to capture dynamic tissue deformation and anatomical geometry. We also extend evaluation beyond prior image-quality metrics by performing quantitative depth accuracy analysis on the SCARED dataset. Diff2DGS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both appearance and geometry, reaching 38.02 dB PSNR on EndoNeRF and 34.40 dB on StereoMIS. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that optimizing for image quality alone does not necessarily translate into optimal 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this, we further optimize the depth quality of the reconstructed 3D results, ensuring more faithful geometry in addition to high-fidelity appearance."}

However, real-world navigation is inherently conditioned by the agent's mobility constraints. For example, a sweeping robot cannot traverse stairs, while a quadruped can. We introduce Capability-Conditioned Navigation (CapNav), a benchmark designed to evaluate how well VLMs can navigate complex indoor spaces given an agent's specific physical and operational capabilities. CapNav defines five representative human and robot agents, each described with physical dimensions, mobility capabilities, and environmental interaction abilities. CapNav provides 45 real-world indoor scenes, 473 navigation tasks, and 2365 QA pairs to test if VLMs can traverse indoor environments based on agent capabilities. We evaluate 13 modern VLMs and find that current VLM's navigation performance drops sharply as mobility constraints tighten, and that even state-of-the-art models struggle with obstacle types that require reasoning on spatial dimensions. We conclude by discussing the implications for capability-aware navigation and the opportunities for advancing embodied spatial reasoning in future VLMs. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/makeabilitylab/CapNav"}
