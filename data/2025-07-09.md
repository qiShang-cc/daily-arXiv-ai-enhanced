Abstract: With fluid antenna system (FAS) gradually establishing itself as a possible
enabling technology for next generation wireless communications, channel
estimation for FAS has become a pressing issue. Existing methodologies however
face limitations in noise suppression. To overcome this, in this paper, we
propose a maximum likelihood (ML)-based channel estimation approach tailored
for FAS systems, designed to mitigate noise interference and enhance estimation
accuracy. By capitalizing on the inherent sparsity of wireless channels, we
integrate an ML-based iterative tomographic algorithm to systematically reduce
noise perturbations during the channel estimation process. Furthermore, the
proposed approach leverages spatial correlation within the FAS channel to
optimize estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency. Simulation results
confirm the efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating superior channel
estimation accuracy and robustness compared to existing benchmark techniques.

Result: 数值模拟验证了所提方法与基于积分的基准结果高度一致，证明了其准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架灵活，可扩展至多种信道和噪声模型，是下一代通信系统中检测算法设计与分析的宝贵工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a performance analysis framework for linear detection in
fast-fading channels with possibly correlated channel and noise. The framework
is both accurate and adaptable, making it well-suited for analyzing a wide
range of channel and noise models. As such, it serves as a valuable tool for
the design and evaluation of detection algorithms in next-generation wireless
communication systems. By characterizing the distribution of the effective
noise after zero-forcing filtering, we derive a semi-analytical and asymptotic
expression for the symbol error rate under Rayleigh fading and
channel-dependent additive circular complex Gaussian noise. The proposed
approach demonstrates excellent agreement with integration-based benchmarks as
confirmed by numerical simulations thus validating its accuracy. The framework
is flexible and can be extended to various channel and noise models, offering a
valuable tool for the design and analysis of detection algorithms in
next-generation communication systems.

### [3] [A Differential Evolution Algorithm with Neighbor-hood Mutation for DOA Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06020)
*Bo Zhou,Kaijie Xu,Yinghui Quan,Mengdao Xing*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于差分进化算法的多模态优化方法DE-NM，用于高效定位2D MUSIC算法的谱峰，显著降低计算成本，适用于实时高分辨率DOA估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D MUSIC算法在DOA估计中计算成本高，限制了其实时应用，因此需要一种更高效的峰值搜索方法。

Method: 将峰值搜索问题重构为多模态优化问题，并提出了带邻域变异的差分进化算法（DE-NM）。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法在估计精度上与传统的网格搜索相当，但显著减少了计算时间。

Conclusion: DE-NM算法为实时高分辨率DOA估计提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Multiple Signal Classification algorithm is a powerful
technique for high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in array
signal processing. However, the exhaustive search over the 2D an-gular domain
leads to high computa-tional cost, limiting its applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we reformulate the peak-finding process as a
multimodal optimization prob-lem, and propose a Differential Evolu-tion
algorithm with Neighborhood Mutation (DE-NM) to efficiently lo-cate multiple
spectral peaks without requiring dense grid sampling. Simu-lation results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable estimation accuracy to
the traditional grid search, while significantly reduc-ing computation time.
This strategy presents a promising solution for real-time, high-resolution DOA
estimation in practical applications. The imple-mentation code is available at
https://github.com/zzb-nice/DOA_multimodel_optimize.

### [5] [Secure Communication of UAV-mounted STAR-RIS under Phase Shift Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06048)

Conclusion: STAR-RIS与无人机NOMA网络的结合在安全通信方面具有显著潜力，适用于未来无线网络的高效频谱利用和安全需求。

Abstract: This paper investigates the secure communication capabilities of a
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network supported by a STAR-RIS
(simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface)
deployed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in the presence of passive
eavesdroppers. The STAR-RIS facilitates concurrent signal reflection and
transmission, allowing multiple legitimate users-grouped via NOMA-to be served
efficiently, thereby improving spectral utilization. Each user contends with an
associated eavesdropper, creating a stringent security scenario. Under Nakagami
fading conditions and accounting for phase shift inaccuracies in the STAR-RIS,
closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy rates of users in both
transmission and reflection paths are derived. An optimization framework is
then developed to jointly adjust the UAV's positioning and the STAR-RIS power
splitting coefficient, aiming to maximize the system's secrecy rate. The
proposed approach enhances secure transmission in STAR-RIS-NOMA configurations
under realistic hardware constraints and offers valuable guidance for the
design of future 6G wireless networks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient acquisition of wireless channel state information
(CSI) is crucial to enhance the communication performance of wireless systems.
However, with the continuous densification of wireless links, increased channel
dimensions, and the use of higher-frequency bands, channel estimation in the
sixth generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks faces new challenges, such
as insufficient orthogonal pilot sequences, inadequate signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) for channel training, and more sophisticated channel statistical
distributions in complex environment. These challenges pose significant
difficulties for classical channel estimation algorithms like least squares
(LS) and maximum a posteriori (MAP). To address this problem, we propose a
novel environment-aware channel estimation framework with location-specific
prior channel distribution enabled by the new concept of channel knowledge map
(CKM). To this end, we propose a new type of CKM called channel score function
map (CSFM), which learns the channel probability density function (PDF) using
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To fully exploit the prior information
in CSFM, we propose a plug-and-play (PnP) based algorithm to decouple the
regularized MAP channel estimation problem, thereby reducing the complexity of
the optimization process. Besides, we employ Tweedie's formula to establish a
connection between the channel score function, defined as the logarithmic
gradient of the channel PDF, and the channel denoiser. This allows the use of
the high-precision, environment-aware channel denoiser from the CSFM to
approximate the channel score function, thus enabling efficient processing of
the decoupled channel statistical components. Simulation results show that the
proposed CSFM-PnP based channel estimation technique significantly outperforms
the conventional techniques in the aforementioned challenging scenarios.

### [7] [Self-supervised Deep Learning for Denoising in Ultrasound Microvascular Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05451)

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为HA2HA的自监督去噪框架，用于提高超声微血管成像的信噪比和对比噪声比，显著改善图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声微血管成像中低信噪比问题影响血管定量和疾病诊断的可靠性，尤其是在无造影或深部组织中。

Method: 使用互补角度子集构建训练对，血管信号保持一致而噪声变化，通过自监督学习实现去噪。

Result: 在多种数据集中验证，信噪比和对比噪声比提升超过15dB，微血管流动可视化效果改善。

Conclusion: HA2HA为无造影和增强超声微血管成像提供了一种无需标记、通用且临床适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound microvascular imaging (UMI) is often hindered by low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially in contrast-free or deep tissue
scenarios, which impairs subsequent vascular quantification and reliable
disease diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose
Half-Angle-to-Half-Angle (HA2HA), a self-supervised denoising framework
specifically designed for UMI. HA2HA constructs training pairs from
complementary angular subsets of beamformed radio-frequency (RF) blood flow
data, across which vascular signals remain consistent while noise varies. HA2HA
was trained using in-vivo contrast-free pig kidney data and validated across
diverse datasets, including contrast-free and contrast-enhanced data from pig
kidneys, as well as human liver and kidney. An improvement exceeding 15 dB in
both contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR was observed, indicating a
substantial enhancement in image quality. In addition to power Doppler imaging,
denoising directly in the RF domain is also beneficial for other downstream
processing such as color Doppler imaging (CDI). CDI results of human liver
derived from the HA2HA-denoised signals exhibited improved microvascular flow
visualization, with a suppressed noisy background. HA2HA offers a label-free,
generalizable, and clinically applicable solution for robust vascular imaging
in both contrast-free and contrast-enhanced UMI.

### [8] [Introducing Image-Space Preconditioning in the Variational Formulation of MRI Reconstructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05312)
*Bastien Milani,Jean-Baptist Ledoux,Berk Can Acikgoz,Xavier Richard*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 本文旨在通过有限维内积空间的框架改进MRI重建方法的理解，特别是图像空间和数据空间预条件化的非传统内积形式，并填补相关数学工具的文献空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI重建方法（如压缩感知和深度学习方法）缺乏系统化的预条件化处理，且相关数学工具的描述较为分散或缺失。

Method: 将图像空间和数据空间预条件化重新表述为有限维内积空间中的非传统内积形式，并将其嵌入到MRI重建问题的变分框架中。

Result: 为MRI重建提供了统一的预条件化嵌入方法，并为相关数学工具提供了面向MRI的教学材料。

Conclusion: 本文不仅改进了MRI重建的理论框架，还填补了相关数学工具的文献空白，对领域内研究人员具有双重价值。

Abstract: The aim of the present article is to enrich the comprehension of iterative
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstructions, including compressed sensing
(CS) and iterative deep learning (DL) reconstructions, by describing them in
the general framework of finite-dimensional inner-product spaces. In
particular, we show that image-space preconditioning (ISP) and data-space
preconditioning (DSP) can be formulated as non-conventional inner-products. The
main gain of our reformulation is an embedding of ISP in the variational
formulation of the MRI reconstruction problem (in an algorithm-independent way)
which allows in principle to naturally and systematically propagate ISP in all
iterative reconstructions, including many iterative DL and CS reconstructions
where preconditioning is lacking. The way in which we apply linear algebraic
tools to MRI reconstructions as presented in this article is a novelty.
  A secondary aim of our article is to offer a certain didactic material to
scientists who are new in the field of MRI reconstruction. Since we explore
here some mathematical concepts of reconstruction, we take that opportunity to
recall some principles that may be understood for experts, but which may be
hard to find in the literature for beginners. In fact, the description of many
mathematical tools of MRI reconstruction is fragmented in the literature or
sometimes missing because considered as a general knowledge. Further, some of
those concepts can be found in mathematic manuals, but not in a form that is
oriented toward MRI. For example, we think of the conjugate gradient descent,
the notion of derivative with respect to non-conventional inner products, or
simply the notion of adjoint. The authors believe therefore that it is
beneficial for their field of research to dedicate some space to such a
didactic material.

*Yiming Zhao,Xuanqi Meng,Xinyu Tong,Xiulong Liu,Xin Xie,Wenyu Qu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了Baton系统，通过水平和垂直维度分析Wi-Fi特征相关性，实现低通信周期下的精准目标跟踪，性能优于现有方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wi-Fi感知系统需要持续通信且易受中断影响，导致性能下降。本文旨在解决Wi-Fi特征缺失时的目标跟踪问题。

Method: 提出Baton系统，探索Wi-Fi特征矩阵的水平和垂直相关性，并设计STAP算法实现特征在时间和链路间的无缝传递。

Result: 实验显示，系统在通信占空比低至20%时，中位跟踪误差为0.46米，优于现有方案，误差减少79.19%。

Conclusion: Baton系统在低通信需求和特征缺失场景下，显著提升了Wi-Fi感知的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Wi-Fi contact-free sensing systems have attracted widespread attention due to
their ubiquity and convenience. The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
technology utilizes off-the-shelf Wi-Fi communication signals for sensing,
which further promotes the deployment of intelligent sensing applications.
However, current Wi-Fi sensing systems often require prolonged and unnecessary
communication between transceivers, and brief communication interruptions will
lead to significant performance degradation. This paper proposes Baton, the
first system capable of accurately tracking targets even under severe Wi-Fi
feature deficiencies. To be specific, we explore the relevance of the Wi-Fi
feature matrix from both horizontal and vertical dimensions. The horizontal
dimension reveals feature correlation across different Wi-Fi links, while the
vertical dimension reveals feature correlation among different time slots.
Based on the above principle, we propose the Simultaneous Tracking And
Predicting (STAP) algorithm, which enables the seamless transfer of Wi-Fi
features over time and across different links, akin to passing a baton. We
implement the system on commercial devices, and the experimental results show
that our system outperforms existing solutions with a median tracking error of
0.46m, even when the communication duty cycle is as low as 20.00%. Compared
with the state-of-the-art, our system reduces the tracking error by 79.19% in
scenarios with severe Wi-Fi feature deficiencies.

### [10] [Frequency-Specific Neural Response and Cross-Correlation Analysis of Envelope Following Responses to Native Speech and Music Using Multichannel EEG Signals: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05635)
*Md. Mahbub Hasan,Md Rakibul Hasan,Md Zakir Hossain,Tom Gedeon*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 研究探讨了语音和音乐包络跟随响应（EFRs）的频率特征，发现其峰值响应集中在alpha、低gamma和高gamma波段，可能与语言感知和记忆处理相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因EFRs的频率特征（如主导频率和频谱相干性）尚不清楚，研究旨在揭示听觉通路对语音和音乐包络的传递特性。

Method: 通过时间平均频谱响应和交叉频谱密度分析，研究了人类头皮四个位置的系统传递函数。

Result: alpha（8-11 Hz）、低gamma（53-56 Hz）和高gamma（78-81 Hz）波段为系统的峰值响应；10-13 Hz、27-29 Hz和62-64 Hz为通道间共有的频率。

Conclusion: 这些频率特征可能是语言和音乐感知的关键，揭示了神经一致性在听觉处理中的作用。

Abstract: Although native speech and music envelope following responses (EFRs) play a
crucial role in auditory processing and cognition, their frequency profile,
such as the dominating frequency and spectral coherence, is largely unknown. We
have assumed that the auditory pathway - which transmits envelope components of
speech and music to the scalp through time-varying neurophysiological processes
- is a linear time-varying system, with the envelope and the multi-channel EEG
responses as excitation and response, respectively. This paper investigates the
transfer function of this system through two analytical techniques -
time-averaged spectral responses and cross-spectral density - in the frequency
domain at four different positions of the human scalp. Our findings suggest
that alpha (8-11 Hz), lower gamma (53-56 Hz), and higher gamma (78-81 Hz) bands
are the peak responses of the system. These frequently appearing dominant
frequency responses may be the key components of familiar speech perception,
maintaining attention, binding acoustic features, and memory processing. The
cross-spectral density, which reflects the spatial neural coherence of the
human brain, shows that 10-13 Hz, 27-29 Hz, and 62-64 Hz are common for all
channel pairs. As neural coherences are frequently observed in these
frequencies among native participants, we suggest that these distributed neural
processes are also dominant in native speech and music perception.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用可移动天线（MAs）优化物理层安全（PLS）的方法，解决了固定位置天线（FPAs）在低空无线通信中因信道复杂度高和窃听者不确定性导致的安全性能限制问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为网络设计者揭示了系统参数如何影响物理层安全性能，为低空通信安全提供了实用指导。

Abstract: In low-altitude wireless communications, the increased complexity of wireless
channels and the uncertainty of eavesdroppers (Eves)--caused by diverse
altitudes, speeds, and obstacles--pose significant challenges to physical layer
security (PLS) technologies based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs),
particularly in terms of beamforming capabilities and spatial efficiency. In
contrast, movable antennas (MAs) offer a flexible solution by enabling channel
reconstruction through antenna movement, effectively compensating for the
limitations of FPAs. In this paper, we aim to derive a closed-form expression
for the secrecy rate, a key metric in PLS, which is often unattainable in
current studies due to the uncertainty of Eves. We construct an equivalent
model that leverages the reconfigurable nature of MAs, equating the secrecy
rates obtained by multiple Eves with single FPAs to those achieved by a single
virtual Eve equipped with an MA array. To minimize the gap between these two
types of secrecy rates, we formulate and solve an optimization problem by
jointly designing the equivalent distance between the transmitter and the
virtual Eve} and the antenna positions of MAs at the virtual Eve. Numerical
simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed equivalent model,
offering a new perspective for PLS strategies. This work provides significant
insights for network designers on how system parameters affect PLS performance.
