This work\nfocuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and\ncarrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical\nthreshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major\npeak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest\npeak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the\nproposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique\nreduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into\nmultiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to\neffectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO\nestimates for all the users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u591a\u7528\u6237OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9a\u65f6\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u591a\u7528\u6237OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7528\u6237\u5bfc\u9891\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u524d\u7f00\u7684\u5bfc\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\uff08SU-PCP\u548cMU-PCP\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\u7684\u5b9a\u65f6\u504f\u79fb\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eCPF-BEM\u7684\u8f7d\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u5b9a\u65f6\u504f\u79fb\u4e0e\u8f7d\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, due to the\nunique system model and inherent constraints, the effective application of the\nPS technique is still an open question in IM-DD systems, particularly in\nsystems with memory effects. In this paper, a novel indirect PS scheme tailored\nfor peak power constrained (PPC) IM-DD systems is proposed. The key idea lies\nin strategically controlling the signal envelope to mitigate memory-induced\nimpairments, such as nonlinearity, overshoot, peak-to-average power ratio\nenhancement, etc. The proposed scheme incorporates a dynamic selective mapping\n(DSLM) mechanism at the transmitter, enabling an untypical bit-to-symbol\nmapping in which the current symbol is not only determined by the current bits\npattern but also by previously generated symbols within a specified memory\nlength. At the receiver side, a turbo equalizer with a modified M-BCJR\nalgorithm is proposed to achieve the recovery of ambiguous bits induced by\nDSLM.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation\nframework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel\ncharacteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel\nacquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments\nbetween different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective\nchannels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique\nacross all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages\nthe position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the\ncharacteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to\nassist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach\nfirst utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the\nobtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central\nprocessing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and\nconcatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to\nreconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition\nperformance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the\nestimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the\npilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position\nlabel-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the\nabsolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during\nthe localization NN training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nPCEnet framework reduces pilot and feedback overheads by up to 50%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684PCEnet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u83b7\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u9053\u83b7\u53d6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u9053\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bfc\u9891\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u5176\u4ed6\u4fe1\u9053\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b80\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cPCEnet\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5c06\u5bfc\u9891\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u5f00\u9500\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe50%\u3002", "conclusion": "PCEnet\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u9053\u83b7\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

This paper investigates the convert\ntransmission design in MEC-based networked ISAC systems towards LAE, where an\nMEC server coordinates multiple access points to simultaneously receive\ncomputation tasks from multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), locate a\ntarget in a sensing area, and maintain UAVs' covert transmission against\nmultiple wardens. We first derive closed-form expressions for the detection\nerror probability (DEP) at wardens. Then, we formulate a total energy\nconsumption minimization problem by optimizing communication, sensing, and\ncomputation resources as well as UAV trajectories, subject to the requirements\non quality of MEC services, DEP, and radar signal-to-interference-and-noise\nratio, and the causality of UAV trajectories. An alternating optimization based\nalgorithm is proposed to handle the considered problem, which decomposes it\ninto two subproblems: joint optimization of communication, sensing, and\ncomputation resources, and UAV trajectory optimization. The former is addressed\nby a successive convex approximation based algorithm, while the latter is\nsolved via a trust-region based algorithm. Simulations validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with various benchmarks, and\nreveal the trade-offs among communication, sensing, and computation in LAE\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08MEC\uff09\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5316ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u853d\u4f20\u8f93\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff08LAE\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08MEC\uff09\u548c\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5728LAE\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u853d\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u91c7\u7528\u9010\u6b21\u51f8\u903c\u8fd1\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u57df\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316LAE\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u9690\u853d\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Despite recent advances using\ndeep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available\nannotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by\nleveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first\nsystematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG\ndelineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including\npreviously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We\nadopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,\nimplemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and\nthe transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and\ncross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and\naugmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our\nresults show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in\nsemi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as\na foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will\nfacilitate further research in this domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5728ECG\u6ce2\u5f62\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u548ctransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0transformer\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3ECG\u6ce2\u5f62\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u6ce8ECG\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u548ctransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faECG\u4e13\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "transformer\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763ECG\u6ce2\u5f62\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u534a\u76d1\u7763ECG\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
