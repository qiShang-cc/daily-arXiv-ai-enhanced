The establishment of permanent lunar bases\ndemands robotic platforms capable of navigating and manipulating in the harsh\nlunar terrain. While wheeled rovers have been the mainstay for planetary\nexploration, their limitations in unstructured and steep terrains motivate the\nadoption of legged robots, which offer superior mobility and adaptability. This\npaper introduces a constrained reinforcement learning framework designed for\nautonomous quadrupedal mobile manipulators operating in lunar environments. The\nproposed framework integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation\ncapabilities while explicitly addressing critical safety constraints, including\ncollision avoidance, dynamic stability, and power efficiency, in order to\nensure robust performance under lunar-specific conditions, such as reduced\ngravity and irregular terrain. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's\neffectiveness in achieving precise 6D task-space end-effector pose tracking,\nachieving an average positional accuracy of 4 cm and orientation accuracy of\n8.1 degrees. The system consistently respects both soft and hard constraints,\nexhibiting adaptive behaviors optimized for lunar gravity conditions. This work\neffectively bridges adaptive learning with essential mission-critical safety\nrequirements, paving the way for advanced autonomous robotic explorers for\nfuture lunar missions."}

While reinforcement\nlearning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often\nsuffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce\nReflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation\nwithout human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop\nwhere the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and\nexecution.\n  The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the\nfull adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway\nenables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically\nsynthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This\nprovides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy\nexploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk\nof \"reward hacking,\" where the agent masters the reward function but fails the\nactual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven\nQuality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and\nselectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent\nremains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a\nconditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration.\n  We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final\nsuccess rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust\nsolution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably\nadapt to new environments."}

Reinforcement Learning (RL), by contrast, can produce highly\nrobust behaviors through stochastic training but often lacks interpretability,\nsuffers from out-of-distribution failures, and requires intensive reward\nengineering. This work presents a GPU-parallelized residual architecture that\ntightly integrates MPC and RL by blending their outputs at the torque-control\nlevel. We develop a kinodynamic whole-body MPC formulation evaluated across\nthousands of agents in parallel at 100 Hz for RL training. The residual policy\nlearns to make targeted corrections to the MPC outputs, combining the\ninterpretability and constraint handling of model-based control with the\nadaptability of RL. The model-based control prior acts as a strong bias,\ninitializing and guiding the policy towards desirable behavior with a simple\nset of rewards.

Designing such a\ncost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex\nurban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego\nproposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal\ntrajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions,\nwe introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling\nconsistent, scene-aware reasoning.
