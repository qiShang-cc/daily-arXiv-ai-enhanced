Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a\nnon-invasive window into brain activity, but conventional methods struggle to\ncapture its transient complexity. We present the \\textbf{EEG Microstate\nAnalysis Framework (EEG-MSAF)}, an end-to-end pipeline that leverages EEG\nmicrostates discrete, quasi-stable topographies to identify DEM-related\nbiomarkers and distinguish DEM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal\ncognition (NC). EEG-MSAF comprises three stages: (1) automated microstate\nfeature extraction, (2) classification with machine learning (ML), and (3)\nfeature ranking using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to highlight key\nbiomarkers. We evaluate on two EEG datasets: the public Chung-Ang University\nEEG (CAUEEG) dataset and a clinical cohort from Thessaloniki Hospital. Our\nframework demonstrates strong performance and generalizability. On CAUEEG,\nEEG-MSAF-SVM achieves \\textbf{89\\% $\\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, surpassing the deep\nlearning baseline CEEDNET by \\textbf{19.3\\%}. On the Thessaloniki dataset, it\nreaches \\textbf{95\\% $\\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, comparable to EEGConvNeXt. SHAP\nanalysis identifies mean correlation and occurrence as the most informative\nmetrics: disruption of microstate C (salience/attention network) dominates DEM\nprediction, while microstate F, a novel default-mode pattern, emerges as a key\nearly biomarker for both MCI and DEM. By combining accuracy, generalizability,\nand interpretability, EEG-MSAF advances EEG-based dementia diagnosis and sheds\nlight on brain dynamics across the cognitive spectrum."}

This makes\noptimal resource allocation across power, subcarriers, and decoding orders\ncrucial for interference channels (ICs), where neither transmitters nor\nreceivers can cooperate. Current orthogonal multiple access (OMA) methods, as\nwell as non-orthogonal (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RSMA) schemes, rely on fixed\nheuristics for interference management, leading to suboptimal rates, power\ninefficiency, and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel minPIC\nframework for optimal power, subcarrier, and decoding order allocation in\ngeneral multi-user ICs.

Despite the convexity of the IC capacity region, fixing\nan SIC order induces non-convexity in resource allocation, traditionally\nrequiring heuristic approximations. We instead introduce a dual-variable-guided\nsorting criterion to identify globally optimal SIC orders, followed by convex\noptimization with auxiliary log-det constraints, efficiently solved via binary\nsearch.

Many of these legacy wireless devices are used by\ncritical infrastructure networks upon which society depends. There is an urgent\nneed to develop schemes that can protect legacy users from such interference.\nFor many applications, legacy users are located within\ngeographically-constrained regions. Several studies have proposed mitigating\ninterference through the implementation of exclusion zones near these\ngeographically-constrained regions.

Our\nkey contributions are a novel energy distance-based location test to robustly\ndetect system model misspecification and a method that leverages the asymmetric\nsensitivities of NLL and ES to distinguish optimism covariance scaling from\nsystem bias. Monte Carlo simulations across six distinct credibility scenarios\ndemonstrate that our proposed method achieves high classification accuracy\n(80-100%), drastically outperforming single-metric baselines which consistently\nfail to provide a complete and correct diagnosis. This framework provides a\npractical tool for turning patterns of credibility indicators into actionable\ndiagnoses of model deficiencies."}

In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater\nVisual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN,\nwhich enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater\nvehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles\nand maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain\nwithout relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting\nlarge-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures\nrobust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater\nenvironments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model\ntransfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases:\nwe first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets\nusing a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor\non an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into\nthe trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both\nsimulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness\nand generalization of our approach.

In this paper, we address this issue by optimizing the transmitted\nconstellation under mixed noise based on a theoretical analysis of the cutoff\nrate (CR). First, starting from the passband model of the mixed noise, we\nderive its corresponding baseband representation. Due to the complexity of the\nCR, an exact analytic expression is generally intractable. Therefore, the\nbaseband noise model is employed to obtain closed-form lower and upper bounds\nof the CR. A piecewise linear approximation is applied to derive efficient\nbounds by exploiting the algebraic properties of the integral terms. These\nbounds are then used as criteria to optimize the transmitted constellation\npoints in both geometric and probabilistic distributions. The projected\ngradient method is employed to solve the optimization problem, and the\nconvergence and properties of the solutions are analyzed. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that the proposed CR bounds are tight and exhibit the expected\nasymptotic behavior. Furthermore, the optimized constellation scheme achieves a\nsignificant rate improvement compared to baselines."}

However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a\ncontinuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably\nfaced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on\ntest-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on\nthe fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.\nHowever, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as\nmultiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for\ntest-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the\nfine-tuned features.

Steering vectors have typically been used for\nrepresenting the spatial characteristics of the sound field as a function of\nthe listening position. The basic algebraic representation of steering vectors\nassuming an idealized environment cannot deal with the scattering effect of the\nsound field. One may thus collect a discrete set of real steering vectors\nmeasured in dedicated facilities and super-resolve (i.e., upsample) them.\nRecently, physics-aware deep learning methods have been effectively used for\nthis purpose.

To\ntackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively\nextract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training\nload and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key\nstrategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental\nSelection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general\nweather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing\ndiverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base\nmodel. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under\nchallenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and\nprediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the\nmodel to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across\ndatasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness.

For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of\nsignals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as\nAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most\nneural networks including large language models (LLMs).

For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations.

We analysed the collected qualitative data with\nThematic Analysis, informed by notes taken during workshops. Through our\nanalysis, we identify four themes regarding key ethical and socio-technical\nquestions about the real-world use of wellbeing robots. We group participants'\ninsights and discussions around these broad thematic questions, discuss them in\nlight of state-of-the-art literature, and highlight areas for future\ninvestigation. Finally, we provide the four questions as a broad framework that\nroboticists can and should use during robotic development and deployment, in\norder to reflect on the ethics and socio-technical dimensions of their robotic\napplications, and to engage in dialogue with communities of robot users. The\nfour questions are: 1) Is the robot safe and how can we know that?, 2) Who is\nthe robot built for and with?, 3) Who owns the robot and the data?, and 4) Why\na robot?."}

Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured\nby high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across\ndownstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what\nconstitutes \"diversity\" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific\nnotion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to\ninconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across\ndifferent approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity\nunexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity\nthat translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --\nallowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We\ndemonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,\na unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills.
