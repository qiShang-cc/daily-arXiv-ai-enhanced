TL;DR: LEO卫星星座在6G系统中面临功率和天线限制，文章提出DISLAC概念，通过卫星间协作提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LEO卫星在6G应用中的性能限制问题。

Method: 引入DISLAC概念，利用卫星间链接实现协作。

Result: 提升吞吐量、定位精度和感知鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以推动DISLAC在未来非地面网络中的部署。

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are rapidly becoming essential
enablers of next-generation wireless systems, offering global broadband access,
high-precision localization, and reliable sensing beyond terrestrial coverage.
However, the inherent limitations of individual LEO satellites, including
restricted power, limited antenna aperture, and constrained onboard processing,
hinder their ability to meet the growing demands of 6G applications. To address
these challenges, this article introduces the concept of distributed integrated
sensing, localization, and communication (DISLAC) over LEO constellations,
inspired by distributed multiple input multiple output architectures. By
enabling inter-satellite cooperation through inter-satellite links, DISLAC can
substantially improve throughput, positioning accuracy, and sensing robustness.
We present illustrative case studies that quantify these benefits and analyze
key system-level considerations, including synchronization, antenna
reconfigurability, and ISL design. The article concludes by outlining open
research directions to advance the practical deployment of DISLAC in future
non-terrestrial networks.

### [2] [Multi-Satellite Cooperative MIMO Transmission: Statistical CSI-Aware RSMA Precoding Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11132)
*Sangwon Jo,Seok-Hwan Park*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了多颗低地球轨道（LEO）卫星之间的协同传输，以提高频谱效率，提出了一种基于统计信道信息（sCSI）的协同速率分割多址接入（RSMA）方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于长延迟和多普勒效应，获取瞬时信道状态信息（iCSI）困难，因此需要一种基于统计信道信息的方案来优化多LEO卫星的协同传输。

Method: 设计了基于MIMO预编码的协同RSMA方案，通过近似闭式上界和加权最小均方误差算法求解最大-最小公平速率（MMFR）优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的sCSI-RSMA方案接近iCSI性能，并显著优于传统的空分多址接入（SDMA）。

Conclusion: 基于统计信道信息的RSMA方案在多LEO卫星系统中具有高效性和可行性，为未来卫星通信提供了新思路。

Abstract: We investigate inter-satellite cooperative transmission in a multiple
low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication system to enhance spectral
efficiency. Specifically, we design multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO)
precoding at LEO satellites for cooperative rate-splitting multiple access
(RSMA). Given the difficulty of acquiring instantaneous channel state
information (iCSI) due to long delays and Doppler effects, we formulate an
ergodic max-min fairness rate (MMFR) maximization problem based on statistical
CSI (sCSI). To address the challenge of ergodic rate evaluation, we approximate
the problem using closed-form upper bounds and develop a weighted minimum mean
squared error-based algorithm to obtain a stationary point. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed sCSI-based RSMA scheme approaches iCSI-based
performance and significantly outperforms conventional space-division multiple
access.

Conclusion: 该算法为解决XL-RIS波束宽度限制问题提供了有效方案，适用于复杂通信场景。

Abstract: To mitigate the issue of limited base station coverage caused by severe
high-frequency electromagnetic wave attenuation, Extremely Large Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surface (XL-RIS) has garnered significant attention due to its high
beam gain. However, XL-RIS exhibits a narrower beam width compared to
traditional RIS, which increases the complexity of beam alignment and
broadcast. To address this problem, we propose a variable-width beam generation
algorithm under the near-field assumption and apply it to the near-field
codebook design for XL-RIS. Our algorithm can achieve beam coverage for
arbitrarily shaped codeword regions and generate a joint codebook for the
multi-XL-RIS system. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed
scheme enables user equipment (UE) to achieve higher spectral efficiency and
lower communication outage probability within the codeword region compared to
existing works. Furthermore, our scheme exhibits better robustness to codeword
region location and area variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在HAR任务中需要大量参数调整且缺乏可解释性，因此研究了KAN作为一种更高效且可解释的替代方案。

Method: 研究采用MotionSense数据集，预处理并归一化加速度计和陀螺仪数据，通过KAN进行特征学习和分类。

Result: 实验表明，KAN在分类性能上优于传统深度神经网络，同时参数数量显著减少。

Conclusion: KAN架构在HAR任务中展现出高效和可解释的潜力，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a critical role in numerous
applications, including healthcare monitoring, fitness tracking, and smart
environments. Traditional deep learning (DL) approaches, while effective, often
require extensive parameter tuning and may lack interpretability. In this work,
we investigate the use of a single three-axis accelerometer and the
Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (KAN) for HAR tasks, leveraging its ability to model
complex nonlinear relationships with improved interpretability and parameter
efficiency. The MotionSense dataset, containing smartphone-based motion sensor
signals across various physical activities, is employed to evaluate the
proposed approach. Our methodology involves preprocessing and normalization of
accelerometer and gyroscope data, followed by KAN-based feature learning and
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the KAN achieves
competitive or superior classification performance compared to conventional
deep neural networks, while maintaining a significantly reduced parameter
count. This highlights the potential of KAN architectures as an efficient and
interpretable alternative for real-world HAR systems. The open-source
implementation of the proposed framework is available at the Project's GitHub
Repository.

### [5] [Enabling low-power massive MIMO with ternary ADCs for AIoT sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11234)
*Shengheng Liu,Ningning Fu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用三进制ADC（T-ADCs）的低功耗AIoT解决方案，通过联合导频和数据（JPD）方案优化信道估计，降低功耗并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络设备数量激增和对泛在智能需求的增长，AIoT功耗问题突出，尤其是高分辨率ADC和多射频链的高功耗问题亟待解决。

Method: 采用T-ADCs和JPD方案进行信道估计，并结合改进的EM和变分推断EM估计器处理确定性和随机性信道。

Result: 仿真验证表明，JPD方案在温和条件下能有效减轻粗量化对信道估计的影响，且无需额外导频开销，T-ADCs和JPD方案在绿色AIoT中具有可行性。

Conclusion: T-ADCs及JPD方案为AIoT提供了一种低功耗、高效的智能感知解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of networked devices and the surging demand for ubiquitous
intelligence have given rise to the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT).
However, the utilization of high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)
and numerous radio frequency chains significantly raises power consumption.
This paper explores a cost-effective solution using ternary ADCs (T-ADCs) in
massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems for low-power AIoT and
specifically addresses channel sensing challenges. The channel is first
estimated through a pilot-aided scheme and refined using a joint-pilot-and-data
(JPD) approach. To assess the performance limits of this two-threshold ADC
system, the analysis includes its hardware-ideal counterpart, the parallel
one-bit ADCs (PO-ADCs) and a realistic scenario where noise variance is unknown
at the receiver is considered. Analytical findings indicate that the JPD scheme
effectively mitigates performance degradation in channel estimation due to
coarse quantization effects under mild conditions, without necessitating
additional pilot overhead. For deterministic and random channels, we propose
modified expectation maximization (EM) and variational inference EM estimators,
respectively. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical results and
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimators in terms of mean
square error and symbol error rate, which showcases the feasibility of
implementing T-ADCs and the associated JPD scheme for greener AIoT smart
sensing.

### [6] [Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware Spatiotemporal Fusion of Satellite Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11259)
*Ryosuke Isono,Shunsuke Ono*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的时空融合框架TSSTF，通过TGTV和TGEC机制解决卫星图像噪声问题并保留精细空间结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像在现实场景中常因设备和环境噪声而退化，现有方法在噪声鲁棒性上表现不足且易丢失空间细节。

Method: 引入TGTV和TGEC机制，分别通过时间引导的总变差和边缘约束优化空间结构保留与噪声鲁棒性。

Result: TSSTF在无噪声条件下与现有方法相当，在噪声条件下表现更优，并提供了推荐参数以增强实用性。

Conclusion: TSSTF通过创新机制有效提升了时空融合的噪声鲁棒性和结构保留能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal (ST) fusion framework for
satellite images, named Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware ST fusion (TSSTF).
ST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial
and temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed
satellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment
and environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on
enhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing
noise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure,
leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces
two key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and
Temporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization
function that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural
details, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a
nearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally
adjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST
fusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC,
and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual
splitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs
comparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and
outperforms them under noisy conditions. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive set of recommended parameter values that consistently yield high
performance across diverse target regions and noise conditions, aiming to
enhance reproducibility and practical utility.

Conclusion: BD-RIS在6G感知中展现了显著优势，尤其在目标定位方面，其优化算法有效提升了性能。

Abstract: Recently, beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has
emerged as a more flexible solution to engineer the wireless propagation
channels, thanks to its non-diagonal reflecting matrix. Although the gain of
the BD-RIS over the conventional RIS in communication has been revealed in many
works, its gain in 6G sensing is still unknown. This motivates us to study the
BD-RIS assisted sensing in this letter. Specifically, we derive the Cramer-Rao
bound (CRB) for estimating the angle-of-arrival (AOA) from the target to the
BD-RIS under the constraint that the BD-RIS scattering matrix is unitary. To
minimize the CRB, we develop an optimization scheme based on an adaptive
Riemannian steepest ascent algorithm that can satisfy the non-convex unitary
constraint. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed BD-RIS-assisted
target localization method achieves superior sensing performance.

Abstract: This letter considers a beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface
(BD-RIS) aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the
BD-RIS can help a multi-antenna base station (BS) serve multiple user
equipments (UEs) and localize a target simultaneously. We formulate an
optimization problem that designs the BS beamforming matrix and the BD-RIS
scattering matrix to maximize UEs' sum rate subject to a localization
Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraint and an additional unitary matrix constraint
for the scattering matrix. Because unitary matrices form a manifold, our
problem belongs to constrained manifold optimization. This letter proposes a
log-barrier based Riemannian steepest ascent method to solve this problem
effectively. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our algorithm and
the performance gain of the BD-RIS aided ISAC systems over the conventional RIS
aided ISAC systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种重要性感知的鲁棒语义传输框架（IRST），用于解决6G时代卫星-地面语义通信中的动态SNR变化和带宽限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G时代卫星-地面语义通信中，动态SNR波动和带宽限制导致任务导向数据传输困难。

Result: IRST框架在多种条件下表现出优于现有基准的性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IRST为带宽稀缺和信道多变的场景提供了一种有效的语义通信解决方案。

Abstract: Satellite-ground semantic communication is anticipated to serve a critical
role in the forthcoming 6G era. Nonetheless, task-oriented data transmission in
such systems remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the dynamic
nature of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fluctuations and the stringent bandwidth
limitations inherent to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite channels. In response
to these constraints, we propose an importance-aware robust semantic
transmission (IRST) framework, specifically designed for scenarios
characterized by bandwidth scarcity and channel variability. The IRST scheme
begins by applying a segmentation model enhancement algorithm to improve the
granularity and accuracy of semantic segmentation. Subsequently, a task-driven
semantic selection method is employed to prioritize the transmission of
semantically vital content based on real-time channel state information.
Furthermore, the framework incorporates a stack-based, SNR-aware channel codec
capable of executing adaptive channel coding in alignment with SNR variations.
Comparative evaluations across diverse operating conditions demonstrate the
superior performance and resilience of the IRST model relative to existing
benchmarks.

TL;DR: SMARTA+是一种高效的计算扩展方法，用于抑制刺激和瞬态直流伪迹，支持实时闭环aDBS系统的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DBS在临床应用中面临刺激信号污染的技术障碍，现有伪迹去除方法在抑制伪迹和算法灵活性之间存在权衡。

Method: 开发了SMARTA+，一种计算效率高的SMARTA扩展方法，能够抑制刺激和瞬态直流伪迹，并支持灵活的算法设计。

Result: SMARTA+在伪迹去除方面表现优于现有方法，计算时间显著减少，同时保留了信号频谱和时域结构。

Conclusion: SMARTA+是推进实时闭环aDBS系统的有前途的工具。

Abstract: Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) leverages symptom-related biomarkers
to deliver personalized neuromodulation therapy, with the potential to improve
treatment efficacy and reduce power consumption compared to conventional DBS.
However, stimulation-induced signal contamination remains a major technical
barrier to advancing its clinical application. Existing artifact removal
strategies, both front-end and back-end, face trade-offs between artifact
suppression and algorithmic flexibility. Among back-end algorithms, Shrinkage
and Manifold-based Artifact Removal using Template Adaptation (SMARTA) has
shown promising performance in mitigating stimulus artifacts with minimal
distortion to local field potentials (LFPs), but its high computational demand
and inability to handle transient direct current (DC) artifacts limit its use
in real-time applications. To address this, we developed SMARTA+, a
computationally efficient extension of SMARTA capable of suppressing both
stimulus and transient DC artifacts while supporting flexible algorithmic
design. We evaluated SMARTA+ using semi-real aDBS data and real data from
Parkinson's disease patients. Compared to SMARTA and other established methods,
SMARTA+ achieved comparable or superior artifact removal while significantly
reducing computation time. It preserved spectral and temporal structures,
ranging from beta band to high-frequency oscillations, and demonstrated
robustness across diverse stimulation protocols. Temporal event localization
analysis further showed improved accuracy in detecting beta bursts. These
findings support SMARTA+ as a promising tool for advancing real-time,
closed-loop aDBS systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高系统吞吐量并降低无授权用户（GFUs）的信息年龄（AoI），同时利用授权用户的剩余资源为GFUs提供高效的信道接入。

Method: 1. 将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）；2. 提出基于DRL的传输调度方法以优化传输概率；3. 设计分层学习算法，上层策略负责波束成形以实现高效授权传输，下层策略最大化分配时隙的利用率。

Result: 1. DRL调度方法在AoI减少上优于现有基线；2. 分层学习算法实现了约31.82%的性能增益；3. 在不同GFUs与GBUs比例的场景下验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: NOMA辅助的SGF框架结合DRL和分层学习算法能有效提升系统性能，减少GFUs的信息年龄，同时充分利用资源。

Abstract: A non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted semi-grant-free (SGF)
framework is proposed to enable channel access for grant-free users (GFUs) by
using residual resources from grant-based users. Under this framework, the
problem of joint beamforming design and transmission scheduling is formulated
to improve the system throughput and reduce the age-of-information of GFUs. The
aforementioned problem is transferred into a Markov Decision Process to model
the changing environment with the transmission/ waiting/ retransmission of
GFUs. In an effort to solve the pertinent problem, firstly, a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) based transmission scheduling approach is proposed
for determining the optimal transmission probability based on the available
transmission slots and transmission status of GFUs. Secondly, a hierarchical
learning algorithm is proposed to analyze the channel state information of GBUs
and the transmission status of GFUs, and to train an upper-level policy based
on this analysis for beamforming to achieve efficient grant-based transmission,
while a lower-level policy adapts to maximize the utilization of transmission
slots allocated by the upper-level agent. The two policies interact to improve
channel access and avoid collisions. Numerical results reveal that 1) The DRL
based transmission scheduling outperforms existing adaptive and state-dependent
baselines in AoI reduction, where an average
three-time-slots-earlier-transmission can be obtained compared to the
state-dependent choice, and five time slots earlier can be achieved when
comparing to the adaptive choice; 2) The hierarchical learning algorithm is
able to achieve approximately a 31.82% gain while maintaining the average AoI
of GFUs within 1.5 time slots. 3) The effectiveness of the hierarchical
learning scheme in NOMA-assisted SGF system is validated across scenarios with
GFUs counts from 1-5 times of GBUs.

Abstract: Liquid crystal (LC) technology has emerged as a promising solution for large
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) at millimeter wave (mmWave) bands,
offering advantages such as low power consumption, scalability, and
continuously tunable phase shifts. For LC-RIS based on the delay-line
architecture, i.e., with dedicated phase shifters, there exists a trade-off
between the maximum achievable phase-shift range and the corresponding
insertion loss, which has not been studied for LC-RIS-assisted wireless systems
yet. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off where a base station (BS) and
an RIS are configured to minimize the transmit power while satisfying a given
quality of service (QoS) for a number of users. Simulation results reveal a
fundamental trade-off between the total transmit power and the achievable data
rate as a function of the LC phase-shift range.

Abstract: The development of porous polymeric membranes remains a labor-intensive
process, often requiring extensive trial and error to identify optimal
fabrication parameters. In this study, we present a fully automated platform
for membrane fabrication and characterization via nonsolvent-induced phase
separation (NIPS). The system integrates automated solution preparation, blade
casting, controlled immersion, and compression testing, allowing precise
control over fabrication parameters such as polymer concentration and ambient
humidity. The modular design allows parallel processing and reproducible
handling of samples, reducing experimental time and increasing consistency.
Compression testing is introduced as a sensitive mechanical characterization
method for estimating membrane stiffness and as a proxy to infer porosity and
intra-sample uniformity through automated analysis of stress-strain curves. As
a proof of concept to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, NIPS was
carried out with polysulfone, the green solvent PolarClean, and water as the
polymer, solvent, and nonsolvent, respectively. Experiments conducted with the
automated system reproduced expected effects of polymer concentration and
ambient humidity on membrane properties, namely increased stiffness and
uniformity with increasing polymer concentration and humidity variations in
pore morphology and mechanical response. The developed automated platform
supports high-throughput experimentation and is well-suited for integration
into self-driving laboratory workflows, offering a scalable and reproducible
foundation for data-driven optimization of porous polymeric membranes through
NIPS.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel robust online calibration framework for
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) anchors in UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems
(VINS). Accurate anchor positioning, a process known as calibration, is crucial
for integrating UWB ranging measurements into state estimation. While several
prior works have demonstrated satisfactory results by using robot-aided systems
to autonomously calibrate UWB systems, there are still some limitations: 1)
these approaches assume accurate robot localization during the initialization
step, ignoring localization errors that can compromise calibration robustness,
and 2) the calibration results are highly sensitive to the initial guess of the
UWB anchors' positions, reducing the practical applicability of these methods
in real-world scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by explicitly
incorporating the impact of robot localization uncertainties into the
calibration process, ensuring robust initialization. To further enhance the
robustness of the calibration results against initialization errors, we propose
a tightly-coupled Schmidt Kalman Filter (SKF)-based online refinement method,
making the system suitable for practical applications. Simulations and
real-world experiments validate the improved accuracy and robustness of our
approach.

Motivation: 通过结合流匹配和3D视觉表示技术，解决现有3D扩散策略训练和推理速度慢的问题，同时提升机器人操控的性能。

Method: 使用流匹配进行轨迹预测，并结合3D预训练视觉场景表示；通过3D相对注意力机制优化动作去噪过程。

Conclusion: 3DFA通过创新设计和优化显著提高了策略的效率和效果，为机器人操控提供了新的技术方向。

Abstract: We present 3D FlowMatch Actor (3DFA), a 3D policy architecture for robot
manipulation that combines flow matching for trajectory prediction with 3D
pretrained visual scene representations for learning from demonstration. 3DFA
leverages 3D relative attention between action and visual tokens during action
denoising, building on prior work in 3D diffusion-based single-arm policy
learning. Through a combination of flow matching and targeted system-level and
architectural optimizations, 3DFA achieves over 30x faster training and
inference than previous 3D diffusion-based policies, without sacrificing
performance. On the bimanual PerAct2 benchmark, it establishes a new state of
the art, outperforming the next-best method by an absolute margin of 41.4%. In
extensive real-world evaluations, it surpasses strong baselines with up to
1000x more parameters and significantly more pretraining. In unimanual
settings, it sets a new state of the art on 74 RLBench tasks by directly
predicting dense end-effector trajectories, eliminating the need for motion
planning. Comprehensive ablation studies underscore the importance of our
design choices for both policy effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有视频生成方法在细粒度操作上表现不佳，且依赖大规模机器人数据集训练扩散模型。GenFlowRL旨在通过对象为中心的低维特征解决这些问题。

Conclusion: GenFlowRL通过对象为中心的流特征，显著提升了机器人学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that video generation models can enhance robot
learning by deriving effective robot actions through inverse dynamics. However,
these methods heavily depend on the quality of generated data and struggle with
fine-grained manipulation due to the lack of environment feedback. While
video-based reinforcement learning improves policy robustness, it remains
constrained by the uncertainty of video generation and the challenges of
collecting large-scale robot datasets for training diffusion models. To address
these limitations, we propose GenFlowRL, which derives shaped rewards from
generated flow trained from diverse cross-embodiment datasets. This enables
learning generalizable and robust policies from diverse demonstrations using
low-dimensional, object-centric features. Experiments on 10 manipulation tasks,
both in simulation and real-world cross-embodiment evaluations, demonstrate
that GenFlowRL effectively leverages manipulation features extracted from
generated object-centric flow, consistently achieving superior performance
across diverse and challenging scenarios. Our Project Page:

Motivation: 人机协作需要机器人快速推断用户意图并透明地进行推理，以帮助用户实现目标。现有的GUIDER框架需要进一步提升其语义理解能力。

Method: 通过VLM和LLM构建语义先验，利用视觉管道（YOLO和Segment Anything Model）生成候选对象，并通过模型评分加权GUIDER的导航和操作层。

Result: 系统能够选择上下文相关的目标并抑制无关对象，一旦信念超过阈值，机器人即可导航到目标区域并检索所需对象。

Conclusion: 未来工作将在Isaac Sim中使用Franka Emika机械臂和Ridgeback底座进行实时辅助评估。

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration requires robots to quickly infer user intent,
provide transparent reasoning, and assist users in achieving their goals. Our
recent work introduced GUIDER, our framework for inferring navigation and
manipulation intents. We propose augmenting GUIDER with a vision-language model
(VLM) and a text-only language model (LLM) to form a semantic prior that
filters objects and locations based on the mission prompt. A vision pipeline
(YOLO for object detection and the Segment Anything Model for instance
segmentation) feeds candidate object crops into the VLM, which scores their
relevance given an operator prompt; in addition, the list of detected object
labels is ranked by a text-only LLM. These scores weight the existing
navigation and manipulation layers of GUIDER, selecting context-relevant
targets while suppressing unrelated objects. Once the combined belief exceeds a
threshold, autonomy changes occur, enabling the robot to navigate to the
desired area and retrieve the desired object, while adapting to any changes in
the operator's intent. Future work will evaluate the system on Isaac Sim using
a Franka Emika arm on a Ridgeback base, with a focus on real-time assistance.

evaluating policies by systematically increasing task complexity and scenario
perturbation to assess robustness, and 3) quantifying performance alignment
between real-world performance and its simulation counterparts.

Conclusion: 研究证明了结合几何感知安全约束的MPC算法在复杂环境中的有效性，为机器人安全导航提供了新方法。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation through unstructured and dynamically-changing
environments is a complex task that continues to present many challenges for
modern roboticists. In particular, legged robots typically possess manipulable
asymmetric geometries which must be considered during safety-critical
trajectory planning. This work proposes a predictive safety filter: a nonlinear
model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for online trajectory generation with
geometry-aware safety constraints based on control barrier functions (CBFs).
Critically, our method leverages Poisson safety functions to numerically
synthesize CBF constraints directly from perception data. We extend the
theoretical framework for Poisson safety functions to incorporate temporal
changes in the domain by reformulating the static Dirichlet problem for
Poisson's equation as a parameterized moving boundary value problem.
Furthermore, we employ Minkowski set operations to lift the domain into a
configuration space that accounts for robot geometry. Finally, we implement our
real-time predictive safety filter on humanoid and quadruped robots in various
safety-critical scenarios. The results highlight the versatility of Poisson
safety functions, as well as the benefit of CBF constrained model predictive
safety-critical controllers.

Result: 在BiGym和RLBench的25项任务中，AC3仅需少量演示即取得更高成功率。

Conclusion: AC3通过针对性稳定机制，显著提升了稀疏奖励任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with long-horizon
robotic manipulation tasks, particularly those involving sparse rewards. While
action chunking is a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, using RL to
directly learn continuous action chunks in a stable and data-efficient manner
remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces AC3 (Actor-Critic for
Continuous Chunks), a novel RL framework that learns to generate
high-dimensional, continuous action sequences. To make this learning process
stable and data-efficient, AC3 incorporates targeted stabilization mechanisms
for both the actor and the critic. First, to ensure reliable policy
improvement, the actor is trained with an asymmetric update rule, learning
exclusively from successful trajectories. Second, to enable effective value
learning despite sparse rewards, the critic's update is stabilized using
intra-chunk $n$-step returns and further enriched by a self-supervised module
providing intrinsic rewards at anchor points aligned with each action chunk. We
conducted extensive experiments on 25 tasks from the BiGym and RLBench
benchmarks. Results show that by using only a few demonstrations and a simple
model architecture, AC3 achieves superior success rates on most tasks,
validating its effective design.

Conclusion: GASv2为手术抓取提供了一种高效、安全且通用的解决方案，为RAS的自动化任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental task in robot-assisted surgery (RAS), and
automating it can reduce surgeon workload while enhancing efficiency, safety,
and consistency beyond teleoperated systems. Most prior approaches rely on
explicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their
generalization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the
ability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising
alternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low
signal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and
millimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This
paper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor
policies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a
single stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic
grasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical
objects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything
for Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping.
GASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception
pipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for
safe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization
for sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based
and ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras.
Extensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both
settings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse
disturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness.

Abstract: Sampling efficiency is critical for deploying visuomotor learning in
real-world robotic manipulation. While task symmetry has emerged as a promising
inductive bias to improve efficiency, most prior work is limited to isometric
symmetries -- applying the same group transformation to all task objects across
all timesteps. In this work, we explore non-isometric symmetries, applying
multiple independent group transformations across spatial and temporal
dimensions to relax these constraints. We introduce a novel formulation of the
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that incorporates the
non-isometric symmetry structures, and propose a simple yet effective data
augmentation method, Multi-Group Equivariance Augmentation (MEA). We integrate
MEA with offline reinforcement learning to enhance sampling efficiency, and
introduce a voxel-based visual representation that preserves translational
equivariance. Extensive simulation and real-robot experiments across two
manipulation domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Realizing embodied artificial intelligence is challenging due to the huge
computation demands of large models (LMs). To support LMs while ensuring
real-time inference, embodied edge intelligence (EEI) is a promising paradigm,
which leverages an LM edge to provide computing powers in close proximity to
embodied robots. Due to embodied data exchange, EEI requires higher spectral
efficiency, enhanced communication security, and reduced inter-user
interference. To meet these requirements, near-field communication (NFC), which
leverages extremely large antenna arrays as its hardware foundation, is an
ideal solution. Therefore, this paper advocates the integration of EEI and NFC,
resulting in a near-field EEI (NEEI) paradigm. However, NEEI also introduces
new challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by isolated EEI or NFC
designs, creating research opportunities for joint optimization of both
functionalities. To this end, we propose radio-friendly embodied planning for
EEI-assisted NFC scenarios and view-guided beam-focusing for NFC-assisted EEI
scenarios. We also elaborate how to realize resource-efficient NEEI through
opportunistic collaborative navigation. Experimental results are provided to
confirm the superiority of the proposed techniques compared with various
benchmarks.

Abstract: Robotics research has long sought to give robots the ability to perceive the
physical world through touch in an analogous manner to many biological systems.
Developing such tactile capabilities is important for numerous emerging
applications that require robots to co-exist and interact closely with humans.
Consequently, there has been growing interest in tactile sensing, leading to
the development of various technologies, including piezoresistive and
piezoelectric sensors, capacitive sensors, magnetic sensors, and optical
tactile sensors. These diverse approaches utilise different transduction
methods and materials to equip robots with distributed sensing capabilities,
enabling more effective physical interactions. These advances have been
supported in recent years by simulation tools that generate large-scale tactile
datasets to support sensor designs and algorithms to interpret and improve the
utility of tactile data. The integration of tactile sensing with other
modalities, such as vision, as well as with action strategies for active
tactile perception highlights the growing scope of this field. To further the
transformative progress in tactile robotics, a holistic approach is essential.
In this outlook article, we examine several challenges associated with the

Abstract: To reduce the computational cost of humanoid motion generation, we introduce
a new approach to representing robot kinematic reachability: the differentiable
reachability map. This map is a scalar-valued function defined in the task
space that takes positive values only in regions reachable by the robot's
end-effector. A key feature of this representation is that it is continuous and
differentiable with respect to task-space coordinates, enabling its direct use
as constraints in continuous optimization for humanoid motion planning. We
describe a method to learn such differentiable reachability maps from a set of
end-effector poses generated using a robot's kinematic model, using either a
neural network or a support vector machine as the learning model. By
incorporating the learned reachability map as a constraint, we formulate
humanoid motion generation as a continuous optimization problem. We demonstrate
that the proposed approach efficiently solves various motion planning problems,
including footstep planning, multi-contact motion planning, and
loco-manipulation planning for humanoid robots.

Result: 在AI2-THOR模拟器中，该方法能提前检测语义和空间不匹配，显著提升任务成功率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 主动重新规划框架有效预防执行失败，为机器人自主性提供了更高的适应性。

Abstract: When humans perform everyday tasks, we naturally adjust our actions based on
the current state of the environment. For instance, if we intend to put
something into a drawer but notice it is closed, we open it first. However,
many autonomous robots lack this adaptive awareness. They often follow
pre-planned actions that may overlook subtle yet critical changes in the scene,
which can result in actions being executed under outdated assumptions and
eventual failure. While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most
existing methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be
inefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for
preventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually
designed rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive
replanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries
by comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against
reference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current
scene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning
module is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan. Experiments
in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate that our approach detects semantic and
spatial mismatches before execution failures occur, significantly improving
task success and robustness.

Conclusion: RTLS方法结合绕行控制器在仅方位TMA中表现出色，显著提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: Bearing-only Target Motion Analysis (TMA) is a promising technique for
passive tracking in various applications as a bearing angle is easy to measure.
Despite its advantages, bearing-only TMA is challenging due to the nonlinearity
of the bearing measurement model and the lack of range information, which
impairs observability and estimator convergence. This paper addresses these
issues by proposing a Recursive Total Least Squares (RTLS) method for online
target localization and tracking using mobile observers. The RTLS approach,
inspired by previous results on Total Least Squares (TLS), mitigates biases in
position estimation and improves computational efficiency compared to
pseudo-linear Kalman filter (PLKF) methods. Additionally, we propose a
circumnavigation controller to enhance system observability and estimator
convergence by guiding the mobile observer in orbit around the target.
Extensive simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The proposed algorithm is
also compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, which confirms its superior
performance in terms of both accuracy and stability.

Abstract: We envision a future in which autonomous robots conduct scientific
experiments in ways that are not only precise and repeatable, but also open,
trustworthy, and transparent. To realize this vision, we present two key
contributions: a semantic execution tracing framework that logs sensor data
together with semantically annotated robot belief states, ensuring that
automated experimentation is transparent and replicable; and the AICOR Virtual
Research Building (VRB), a cloud-based platform for sharing, replicating, and
validating robot task executions at scale. Together, these tools enable
reproducible, robot-driven science by integrating deterministic execution,
semantic memory, and open knowledge representation, laying the foundation for
autonomous systems to participate in scientific discovery.

Method: 利用规划失败的反馈信号（规划器不确定性）触发在线进化，通过自监督损失针对关键对象微调预测模型。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，EvoPSF显著提升了规划性能，尤其是在跨区域和异常条件下。

Conclusion: EvoPSF通过在线进化机制，有效增强了自动驾驶系统对动态环境的适应能力和规划稳定性。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in autonomous driving, with
systems evolving from modular pipelines to end-to-end architectures. However,
most existing methods are trained offline and lack mechanisms to adapt to new
environments during deployment. As a result, their generalization ability
diminishes when faced with unseen variations in real-world driving scenarios.
In this paper, we break away from the conventional "train once, deploy forever"
paradigm and propose EvoPSF, a novel online Evolution framework for autonomous
driving based on Planning-State Feedback. We argue that planning failures are
primarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such
failures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To
address this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,
using it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than
performing blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to
identify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are
primarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we
compute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints
from the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from
the perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then
backpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the
model's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion
predictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors.
Experiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset
demonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under
challenging conditions.

*Tatiana Zemskova,Aleksei Staroverov,Dmitry Yudin,Aleksandr Panov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OVSegDT的轻量级Transformer策略，通过语义分支和熵自适应损失调制，解决了开放词汇对象目标导航中的过拟合和泛化问题，显著提升了性能并减少了碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端策略在小规模模拟数据集上过拟合，泛化能力差且不安全（频繁碰撞）。为了解决这些问题，论文提出了新的方法。

Method: OVSegDT包含两个关键组件：语义分支（包括目标二进制掩码编码器和辅助分割损失函数）和熵自适应损失调制（动态平衡模仿和强化信号）。

Result: 该方法将训练样本复杂度降低了33%，碰撞次数减少了一半，并在HM3D-OVON上实现了最先进的性能（40.1% SR，20.9% SPL）。

Conclusion: OVSegDT在不使用深度、里程计或大型视觉语言模型的情况下，显著提升了开放词汇对象目标导航的性能和安全性。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary Object Goal Navigation requires an embodied agent to reach
objects described by free-form language, including categories never seen during
training. Existing end-to-end policies overfit small simulator datasets,
achieving high success on training scenes but failing to generalize and
exhibiting unsafe behaviour (frequent collisions). We introduce OVSegDT, a
lightweight transformer policy that tackles these issues with two synergistic
components. The first component is the semantic branch, which includes an
encoder for the target binary mask and an auxiliary segmentation loss function,
grounding the textual goal and providing precise spatial cues. The second
component consists of a proposed Entropy-Adaptive Loss Modulation, a per-sample
scheduler that continuously balances imitation and reinforcement signals
according to the policy entropy, eliminating brittle manual phase switches.
These additions cut the sample complexity of training by 33%, and reduce
collision count in two times while keeping inference cost low (130M parameters,
RGB-only input). On HM3D-OVON, our model matches the performance on unseen
categories to that on seen ones and establishes state-of-the-art results (40.1%
SR, 20.9% SPL on val unseen) without depth, odometry, or large vision-language
models. Code is available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/OVSegDT.

Motivation: 现有UGV数据集无法满足导航与地图构建技术的需求，因此开发i2Nav-Robot来填补这一空白。

Method: 整合多种最新传感器（如固态LiDAR、4D雷达等），并通过硬件同步与离线校准确保时间同步，覆盖多样化的室内外场景。

Conclusion: i2Nav-Robot为UGV导航与地图构建提供了高质量的数据支持。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable navigation is crucial for autonomous unmanned ground
vehicle (UGV). However, current UGV datasets fall short in meeting the demands
for advancing navigation and mapping techniques due to limitations in sensor
configuration, time synchronization, ground truth, and scenario diversity. To
address these challenges, we present i2Nav-Robot, a large-scale dataset
designed for multi-sensor fusion navigation and mapping in indoor-outdoor
environments. We integrate multi-modal sensors, including the newest front-view
and 360-degree solid-state LiDARs, 4-dimensional (4D) radar, stereo cameras,
odometer, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, and inertial
measurement units (IMU) on an omnidirectional wheeled robot. Accurate
timestamps are obtained through both online hardware synchronization and
offline calibration for all sensors. The dataset comprises ten larger-scale
sequences covering diverse UGV operating scenarios, such as outdoor streets,
and indoor parking lots, with a total length of about 17060 meters.
High-frequency ground truth, with centimeter-level accuracy for position, is
derived from post-processing integrated navigation methods using a
navigation-grade IMU. The proposed i2Nav-Robot dataset is evaluated by more
than ten open-sourced multi-sensor fusion systems, and it has proven to have
superior data quality.

Result: 在Argoverse 2和nuPlan等基准测试中，Polaris表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 极坐标系统更直观且有效地建模了自动驾驶中的空间关系，显著提升了轨迹预测和规划的准确性。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning in autonomous driving are highly
challenging due to the complexity of predicting surrounding agents' movements
and planning the ego agent's actions in dynamic environments. Existing methods
encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian
coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and
surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does
not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on
their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt
the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and
angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model
spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and
directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel
method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from
conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar
representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations
and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement
modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and
planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and
planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant
planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However,
the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent
sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions
with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for
developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking
on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to
train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally
generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then
transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue
facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement
learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective
combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical
evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior
zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also
analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics,
which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational
cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating
reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a critical step towards
deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.

Abstract: Automatically generating agile whole-body motions for legged and humanoid
robots remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. While numerous trajectory
optimization approaches have been proposed, there is no clear guideline on how
the choice of floating-base space parameterization affects performance,
especially for agile behaviors involving complex contact dynamics. In this
paper, we present a comparative study of different parameterizations for direct
transcription-based trajectory optimization of agile motions in legged systems.
We systematically evaluate several common choices under identical optimization
settings to ensure a fair comparison. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
formulation based on the tangent space of SE(3) for representing the robot's
floating-base pose, which, to our knowledge, has not received attention from
the literature. This approach enables the use of mature off-the-shelf numerical
solvers without requiring specialized manifold optimization techniques. We hope
that our experiments and analysis will provide meaningful insights for
selecting the appropriate floating-based representation for agile whole-body
motion generation.

Conclusion: MultiPark成功解决了停车任务中的多模态行为和因果混淆问题，提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于真实世界的停车环境。

Abstract: Parking accurately and safely in highly constrained spaces remains a critical
challenge. Unlike structured driving environments, parking requires executing
complex maneuvers such as frequent gear shifts and steering saturation. Recent
attempts to employ imitation learning (IL) for parking have achieved promising
results. However, existing works ignore the multimodal nature of parking
behavior in lane-free open space, failing to derive multiple plausible
solutions under the same situation. Notably, IL-based methods encompass
inherent causal confusion, so enabling a neural network to generalize across
diverse parking scenarios is particularly difficult. To address these
challenges, we propose MultiPark, an autoregressive transformer for multimodal
parking. To handle paths filled with abrupt turning points, we introduce a
data-efficient next-segment prediction paradigm, enabling spatial
generalization and temporal extrapolation. Furthermore, we design learnable
parking queries factorized into gear, longitudinal, and lateral components,
parallelly decoding diverse parking behaviors. To mitigate causal confusion in
IL, our method employs target-centric pose and ego-centric collision as
outcome-oriented loss across all modalities beyond pure imitation loss.
Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that MultiPark achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. We deploy MultiPark on a
production vehicle, further confirming our approach's robustness in real-world
parking environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tracking the position of a
cable-suspended payload carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle, with a focus on
real-world deployment and minimal hardware requirements. In contrast to many
existing approaches that rely on motion-capture systems, additional onboard
cameras, or instrumented payloads, we propose a framework that uses only
standard onboard sensors--specifically, real-time kinematic global navigation
satellite system measurements and data from the onboard inertial measurement
unit--to estimate and control the payload's position. The system models the
full coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and payload, and integrates a
linear Kalman filter for state estimation, a model predictive contouring
control planner, and an incremental model predictive controller. The control
architecture is designed to remain effective despite sensing limitations and
estimation uncertainty. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
system achieves performance comparable to control based on ground-truth
measurements, with only minor degradation (< 6%). The system also shows strong
robustness to variations in payload parameters. Field experiments further
validate the framework, confirming its practical applicability and reliable
performance in outdoor environments using only off-the-shelf aerial vehicle
hardware.

Conclusion: 优选方法在低成本和无传感器的前提下实现了接近自动分段控制的性能，适合实际农业应用。

Abstract: Automatic Section Control (ASC) is a long-standing trend for spraying in
agriculture. It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to
(i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii)
to dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray
nozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not
possible without sensors, in particular for accurate positioning data. Spraying
and the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In
addition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift,
boom height, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, and so forth. In view of
this complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist.
Therefore, an Automatic Multi-Sections Control method is compared to a proposed
simpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching.
The comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is
intrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic.
Combinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as
three sections-setups are compared. The three sections-setups differ by
controlling 48 sections, 2 sections or controlling all nozzles uniformly with
the same control signal as one single section. Methods are evaluated on 10
diverse real-world field examples, including non-convex field contours,
freeform mainfield lanes and multiple obstacle areas. A preferred method is
suggested that (i) minimises area coverage pathlength, (ii) offers intermediate
overlap, (iii) is suitable for manual driving by following a pre-planned
predictive spray switching logic for an area coverage path plan, and (iv) and
in contrast to ASC can be implemented sensor-free and therefore at low cost.

Abstract: Deploying multiple machine learning models on resource-constrained robotic
platforms for different perception tasks often results in redundant
computations, large memory footprints, and complex integration challenges. In
response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular
framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while
maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework
architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image
representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU
memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running
in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in
feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while
enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We
demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation
using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object
detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared
to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine
offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint
while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during
runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++
(Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse
robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time
performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized

Abstract: Effective and efficient agricultural manipulation and harvesting depend on
accurately understanding the current state of the grasp. The agricultural
environment presents unique challenges due to its complexity, clutter, and
occlusion. Additionally, fruit is physically attached to the plant, requiring
precise separation during harvesting. Selecting appropriate sensors and
modeling techniques is critical for obtaining reliable feedback and correctly
identifying grasp states. This work investigates a set of key sensors, namely
inertial measurement units (IMUs), infrared (IR) reflectance, tension, tactile
sensors, and RGB cameras, integrated into a compliant gripper to classify grasp
states. We evaluate the individual contribution of each sensor and compare the
performance of two widely used classification models: Random Forest and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest
classifier, trained in a controlled lab environment and tested on real cherry
tomato plants, achieved 100% accuracy in identifying slip, grasp failure, and
successful picks, marking a substantial improvement over baseline performance.
Furthermore, we identify a minimal viable sensor combination, namely IMU and
tension sensors that effectively classifies grasp states. This classifier
enables the planning of corrective actions based on real-time feedback, thereby
enhancing the efficiency and reliability of fruit harvesting operations.

TL;DR: ViPE是一个高效的视频处理引擎，用于从无约束的原始视频中估计相机参数和密集深度图，显著优于现有基线，并用于标注大规模视频数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无约束视频中获取精确3D注释的挑战，为空间AI系统提供高质量的几何感知数据。

Method: 开发ViPE引擎，支持多种相机模型和场景，高效估计相机内参、运动和深度图。

Result: ViPE在TUM/KITTI序列上比现有基线表现优18%/50%，运行速度为3-5FPS；标注了96M帧大规模数据集。

Conclusion: ViPE及其开源数据集有望推动空间AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide
range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on
large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from
in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a
handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE
efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric
depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios,
including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports
various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We
have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing
uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and
runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to
annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around
100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K
panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with
accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the
annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI
systems.

*Qi Liu,Yabei Li,Hongsong Wang,Lei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了HQ-OV3D框架，旨在通过生成高质量伪标签解决开放词汇3D检测中几何精度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭式3D检测框架无法满足开放世界应用需求，现有开放词汇方法的几何精度往往被忽视。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：IMCV提案生成器利用跨模态几何一致性生成高质量3D提案；ACA降噪器通过DDIM机制逐步优化提案。

Result: 在新型类别的mAP上提升了7.37%，表明伪标签质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HQ-OV3D不仅是强大的开放词汇3D检测器，还可作为现有检测流程的高质量伪标签生成工具。

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of
open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D
detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of
pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language
models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of
pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,
remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality
Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and
refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework
comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal
Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate
high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)
Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors
from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to
the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our
approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating
the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D
can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also
as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary
detection or annotation pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用稀疏3D语义高斯泼溅的协作3D语义占据预测方法，克服了现有方法的通信成本高或依赖精确深度估计的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D语义占据预测方法在协作场景中因高通信成本或依赖深度估计而受限的问题。

Method: 通过共享和融合中间高斯基元，实现交叉代理融合，联合编码几何和语义，减少通信量。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU上分别比单代理和基线协作方法提升8.42/3.28和5.11/22.41分，通信量减少至34.6%时仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少通信成本的同时，显著提升了协作感知的性能，适用于通信资源有限的场景。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information,
overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in
single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D
semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur
high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth
estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to
collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first
approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D
semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian
primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based
cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent
Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which
reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and
sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while
reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods
by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,
respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our
method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6%
communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited
communication budgets.

Abstract: Human-Robot-Collaboration can enhance workflows by leveraging the mutual

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了利用神经信号（EEG）评估rTMS对甲基苯丙胺（METH）成瘾者渴望水平影响的可行性，发现gamma频段的RBP可作为区分成瘾者和健康人的生物标志物，并验证了rTMS的疗效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统问卷评估rTMS对METH成瘾者渴望水平的影响存在主观性，研究旨在通过EEG信号提供更客观的结果。

Method: 分析20名METH成瘾者和20名健康人的EEG信号，对比rTMS前后的RBP变化，使用随机森林模型进行数据分析。

Result: gamma RBP是区分成瘾者和健康人的最优频段，准确率达90%。rTMS后，成瘾者的RBP更接近健康人。

Conclusion: gamma RBP可作为评估rTMS疗效和成瘾者的生物标志物，为定制化闭环神经调节系统提供参数。

Abstract: The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on
methamphetamine (METH) users' craving levels is often assessed using
questionnaires. This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to
obtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted
participants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy
participants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15
METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power
(RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31
channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically,
MAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as
indicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma
RBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT
and HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is
lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be
validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the
TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when
receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to
METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and
HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time
monitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for
implementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH
addiction.

Method: 使用两个耦合克尔非线性振荡器，分析输入驱动强度、克尔非线性和振荡器耦合等参数对预测性能的影响，并通过对数负性和NRMSE量化纠缠和预测精度。

Result: 结果表明纠缠在输入频率阈值内提供计算优势，且较高耗散率可能提升性能，但纠缠不改善最佳误差。

Conclusion: 研究为高性能、高效的量子机器学习和时间序列预测提供了新理解。

Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently
process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on
two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series
prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially
high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series
prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr
nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in
improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on
predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify
entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate
predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a
computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input
frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In
particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance.
While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and
worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case
error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum
reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and
time-series forecasting.

Motivation: 无线传输大负载（如高分辨率图像和LiDAR点云）是ROS 2中的主要瓶颈，其DDS协议在无线链路下性能显著下降，但原因尚未被深入研究。

Method: 通过网络层分析，识别出IP碎片过多、重传时机低效和缓冲区拥塞等关键问题，提出了一种轻量级优化框架，通过XML配置调整通信参数。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在现有DDS协议失败的情况下成功传输大负载，同时保持低延迟。

Conclusion: 提出的优化框架无需修改协议或增加组件，能够显著提升ROS 2在无线环境中的传输性能。

Abstract: Wireless transmission of large payloads, such as high-resolution images and
LiDAR point clouds, is a major bottleneck in ROS 2, the leading open-source
robotics middleware. The default Data Distribution Service (DDS) communication
stack in ROS 2 exhibits significant performance degradation over lossy wireless
links. Despite the widespread use of ROS 2, the underlying causes of these
wireless communication challenges remain unexplored. In this paper, we present
the first in-depth network-layer analysis of ROS 2's DDS stack under wireless
conditions with large payloads. We identify the following three key issues:
excessive IP fragmentation, inefficient retransmission timing, and congestive
buffer bursts. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and fully
compatible DDS optimization framework that tunes communication parameters based
on link and payload characteristics. Our solution can be seamlessly applied
through the standard ROS 2 application interface via simple XML-based QoS
configuration, requiring no protocol modifications, no additional components,
and virtually no integration efforts. Extensive experiments across various
wireless scenarios demonstrate that our framework successfully delivers large
payloads in conditions where existing DDS modes fail, while maintaining low
end-to-end latency.
