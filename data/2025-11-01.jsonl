However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely\non computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental\ninterference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided\nand light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength\nindicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically\ninterpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce\nthe model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to\nenvironmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our\nmodel reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under\nconventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the\nprevious benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance\nis achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a\nMobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions. The\ncombination of high accuracy, robustness to interference, and computational\nefficiency makes our framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device\ndeployment in edge devices, paving the way for more intelligent and reliable\nwireless communication systems."}

To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical\nMasked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked\nautoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces\nmulti resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal\nscales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter\ninto a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and\ngenerative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art\nfoundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.\nHiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on\nwatch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true\nedge inference.

To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,\nand robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel\nSpatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene\ngeometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared\nrepresentation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a\nbrain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global\nplanning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute\nactions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution\nenables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent\nstate synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex\ncoordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households.
