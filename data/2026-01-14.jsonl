Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) is assessed here as an output-only alternative, in line with Operational Modal Analysis approaches such as Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing. A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar is instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven runs are carried out: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual up-down throttle sweep. The acquired spectra indicate that the dominant resonances remain observable under propeller excitation, while low-throttle conditions introduce narrowband harmonics that may mask structural peaks; the sweep reduces persistent overlap. Modal parameters are identified for the baseline and sweep cases using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF). The first two modes remain closely matched (Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) > 0.99), whereas the third mode shows reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and a larger frequency shift, consistent with propeller-induced bending--torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control. Overall, PVT provides a viable complement to GVT for extracting low-frequency modal information and motivates pursuing future work on automated throttle scheduling and coupling-aware test planning."}

Existing compressive sensing (CS)-based and deep learning (DL)- based schemes preprocess the channel by truncating it in the angular-delay domain. However, the energy leakage effect caused by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) basis will be more serious and leads to a bottleneck in recovery accuracy when applied to wideband channels such as those in U6G. To solve this problem, we introduce the Loewner Interpolation (LI) framework which generates a set of dynamic bases based on the current CSI matrix, enabling highly efficient compression in the frequency domain. Then, the LI basis is further compressed in the spatial domain through a neural network. To achieve a flexible trade-off between feedback overhead and recovery accuracy, we design a rateless auto-encoder trained with tail dropout and a multi-objective learning schedule, supporting variable-length feedback with a singular model. Meanwhile, the codewords are ranked by importance, ensuring that the base station (BS) can still maintain acceptable reconstruction performance under limited feedback with tail erasures. Furthermore, an adaptive quantization strategy is developed for the feedback framework to enhance robustness. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could achieve higher CSI feedback accuracy with less or equal feedback overhead, and improve spectral efficiency compared with baseline schemes."}

Traditional approaches - especially robot-camera extrinsic estimation - often rely on high-precision actuators and require time-consuming routines such as hand-eye calibration. In contrast, modern learning-based robot control is increasingly trained and deployed from RGB observations on lower-cost hardware.\n  Our key insight is twofold. First, we cast robot state estimation as 6D pose estimation of each link from a single RGB image: the robot-camera base transform is obtained directly as the estimated base-link pose, and the joint state is recovered via a lightweight global optimization that enforces kinematic consistency with the observed link poses (optionally warm-started with encoder readings). Second, we make per-link 6D pose estimation robust and simple - even without learning - by introducing the fiducial exoskeleton: a lightweight 3D-printed mount with a fiducial marker on each link and known marker-link geometry.\n  This design yields robust camera-robot extrinsics, per-link SE(3) poses, and joint-angle state from a single image, enabling robust state estimation even on unplugged robots. Demonstrated on a low-cost robot arm, fiducial exoskeletons substantially simplify setup while improving calibration, state accuracy, and downstream 3D control performance.

SDP acts as a standardization layer that decouples learning tasks from hardware heterogeneity. To this end, SDP enforces deterministic physical-layer sanitization, canonical tensor construction, and standardized training and evaluation procedures, decoupling learning performance from hardware-specific artifacts. Rather than introducing task-specific models, SDP establishes a principled protocol foundation for fair evaluation across diverse sensing tasks and platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDP achieves competitive accuracy while substantially improving stability, reducing inter-seed performance variance by orders of magnitude on complex activity recognition tasks. A real-world experiment using commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware further illustrating the protocol's interoperability across heterogeneous hardware. By providing a unified protocol and benchmark, SDP enables reproducible and comparable wireless sensing research and supports the transition from ad hoc experimentation toward reliable engineering practice."}

The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments."}

Both tasks are performed through a beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of voxels within the volumetric surveillance region simultaneously with the 5G SSB burst. To prevent interference between communication and sensing signals, we propose a precoder design that guarantees orthogonality of the sensing beam and the SSB in order to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while ensuring a specified SINR for users, as well as minimizing the impact of the direct link. The results demonstrate that the proposed precoder outperforms the non-coordinated precoder and is minimally affected by variations in drone altitude."}

To overcome these issues, we need a gripper capable of adaptive grasping to irregular terrains, not only for grasping but also for measuring the shape of the terrain surface accurately. We developed a gripper that can grasp both convex and concave terrains and simultaneously measure the terrain shape by introducing a pin-array structure. We demonstrated the mechanism of the gripper and evaluated its grasping and terrain recognition performance using a prototype. Moreover, the proposed pin-array design works well for 3D terrain mapping as well as adaptive grasping for irregular terrains."}

While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection. System level simulations under directed, time varying wind conditions show that waveform design is critical for performance, enabling multi symbol modulation using a single particle type when dispersion is sufficiently controlled. The results demonstrate that time varying diffusion advection channels can be systematically modeled and engineered using communication theoretic tools, providing a realistic foundation for particle based communication in complex flow environments."}

While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. In this work we build on the rich theoretical promise of randomized dimensionality reduction to develop RF as a real, practical approach.

Using thresholded data during candidate selection refines regions of interest, while stage-specific feature processing optimizes performance. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of thresholding on feature maps, candidate localization, and multi-feature scenarios. Results demonstrate that thresholding improves observer performance by excluding low-salience features, particularly in noisy environments. Intermediate thresholds often outperform no thresholding, indicating that retaining only relevant features is more effective than keeping all features.\n  Additionally, the model demonstrates effective training with fewer images while maintaining alignment with human performance.

To this end, we propose a data-efficient framework, which is designed to bypass robot grasp data collection by exploiting the rich, object-centric semantic priors latent in pretrained generative diffusion models. Temporally aligned and fine-grained grasp affordances are extracted from raw human video demonstrations and fused with 3D scene geometry from depth images to infer semantically grounded contact targets. A kinematics-aware retargeting module then maps these affordance representations to diverse dexterous hands without per-hand retraining. The resulting system produces stable, functionally appropriate multi-contact grasps that remain reliably successful across common objects and tools, while exhibiting strong generalization across previously unseen object instances within a category, pose variations, and multiple hand embodiments. This work (i) introduces a semantic affordance extraction pipeline leveraging vision-language generative priors for dexterous grasping, (ii) demonstrates cross-hand generalization without constructing hardware-specific grasp datasets, and (iii) establishes that a single depth modality suffices for high-performance grasp synthesis when coupled with foundation-model semantics.

ActiveVLA projects 3D inputs onto multi-view 2D projections, identifies critical 3D regions, and supports dynamic spatial awareness. (2) Active perception optimization. Drawing on the localized critical regions, ActiveVLA uses an active view selection strategy to choose optimal viewpoints. These viewpoints aim to maximize amodal relevance and diversity while minimizing occlusions. Additionally, ActiveVLA applies a 3D zoom-in to improve resolution in key areas. Together, these steps enable finer-grained active perception for precise manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActiveVLA achieves precise 3D manipulation and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks. Moreover, ActiveVLA transfers seamlessly to real-world scenarios, enabling robots to learn high-precision tasks in complex environments."}

The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments."}

Looking towards future networks, the extrapolation of this paradigm leads to systems with many hundreds of antennas per base station, raising concerns regarding hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. This article suggests more intelligent array designs that reduce the need for excessive antenna numbers. We revisit classical uniform array design principles and explain how their uniform spatial sampling leads to unnecessary redundancies in practical deployment scenarios. By exploiting non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements -- based on either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas -- we demonstrate how superior multiuser MIMO performance can be achieved with far fewer antennas. These principles are inspired by previous works on wireless localization. We explain and demonstrate numerically how these concepts can be adapted for communications to improve the average sum rate and similar metrics. The results suggest a paradigm shift for future antenna array design, where antenna intelligence replaces sheer antenna count. This opens new opportunities for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable Gigantic MIMO systems."}

The framework first divides the MA movement area into multiple subregions, and employs the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (NOMP) to achieve high-precision angle estimation in each subregion. Subsequently, a method called near-field localization via subregion ray clustering (LSRC) is proposed for identifying the positions of scatterers.

This paper presents a Real2Sim framework that autonomously generates and executes Behavior Trees for task-specific physical interactions to acquire only the parameters required for a given simulation objective, without relying on pre-defined task templates or expert-designed exploration routines. Given a high-level user request, an incomplete simulation description, and an RGB observation of the scene, a vision-language model performs multi-modal reasoning to identify relevant objects, infer required physical parameters, and generate a structured Behavior Tree composed of elementary robotic actions. The resulting behavior is executed on a torque-controlled Franka Emika Panda, enabling compliant, contact-rich interactions for parameter estimation. The acquired measurements are used to automatically construct a physics-aware simulation. Experimental results on the real manipulator demonstrate estimation of object mass, surface height, and friction-related quantities across multiple scenarios, including occluded objects and incomplete prior models.

Existing methods have demonstrated agility on parkour courses but often rely on end-to-end sensorimotor models with limited generalization and interpretability. By contrast, methods targeting generalized locomotion typically exhibit limited agility and struggle with visual occlusions. We introduce AME-2, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile and generalized locomotion that incorporates a novel attention-based map encoder in the control policy. This encoder extracts local and global mapping features and uses attention mechanisms to focus on salient regions, producing an interpretable and generalized embedding for RL-based control. We further propose a learning-based mapping pipeline that provides fast, uncertainty-aware terrain representations robust to noise and occlusions, serving as policy inputs. It uses neural networks to convert depth observations into local elevations with uncertainties, and fuses them with odometry. The pipeline also integrates with parallel simulation so that we can train controllers with online mapping, aiding sim-to-real transfer. We validate AME-2 with the proposed mapping pipeline on a quadruped and a biped robot, and the resulting controllers demonstrate strong agility and generalization to unseen terrains in simulation and in real-world experiments."}

We present Motive (MOTIon attribution for Video gEneration), a motion-centric, gradient-based data attribution framework that scales to modern, large, high-quality video datasets and models. We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generative models and to use it to curate fine-tuning data."}
