  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过优化SIM相位偏移和数字波束成形，解决传统交替优化方法在SIM层数增加时性能饱和的问题。

Method: 采用先优化SIM相位偏移再优化数字波束成形的策略，并使用迭代投影梯度方法优化相位偏移。

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a disruptive
technology for future wireless networks. To investigate their capabilities, we
study the sum rate maximization problem in an SIM-based multiuser (MU)
multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system. A vast majority of pioneer
studies, if not all, address this fundamental problem using the prevailing
alternating optimization (AO) framework, where the digital beamforming (DB) and
SIM phase shifts are optimized alternately. However, many of these approaches
suffer from suboptimal performance, quickly leading to performance saturation,
when the number of SIM layers increases assuming the \emph{fixed SIM
thickness}. In this letter, we demonstrate that significant performance gains
can still be achieved, and such saturation does not occur with the proposed
method in the considered setting. To this end, we provide practical design
guidelines to improve AO-based optimization of digital precoders and SIM phase
shifts. Specifically, we show that (i) optimizing the SIM phase shifts first
yields significant performance improvements, compared to optimizing the DB
first; and (ii) when applying projected gradient (PG) methods, which are
gradually becoming more popular to optimize the phase shifts thanks to their
scalability, we find that using an iterative PG method achieves better
performance than the single PG step, which is commonly used in existing
solutions. Based on these customizations, the proposed method achieves a higher
achievable sum rate (ASR) of up to $\ensuremath{115.53\%}$, compared to
benchmark schemes for the scenarios under consideration.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology holds immense potential
for increasing the performance of wireless networks. Therefore, RIS is also
regarded as one of the solutions to address communication challenges in
high-mobility scenarios, such as Doppler shift and fast fading. This paper
investigates a high-speed train (HST) multiple-input single-output (MISO)
communication system aided by a RIS. We propose a block coordinate descent
(BCD) algorithm to jointly optimize the RIS phase shifts and the transmit
beamforming vectors to maximize the channel gain. Numerical results are
provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the
system performance, achieving an average channel gain improvement of 15 dB
compared to traditional schemes. Additionally, the introduction of RIS
eliminates outage probability and improves key performance metrics such as
achievable rate, channel capacity, and bit error rate (BER). These findings
highlight the critical role of RIS in enhancing HST communication systems.

Abstract: Ongoing discussions about the future of wireless communications are reaching
a turning point as standardization activities for the sixth generation of
mobile networks (6G) become more mature. New technologies must now face renewed
scrutiny by the industry and academia in order to be ready for deployment in
the near future. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) gained
attention as a promising solution for improving the propagation conditions of
signal transmission in general. The RIS is a planar array of tunable resonant
elements designed to dynamically and precisely manipulate the reflection of
incident electromagnetic waves. However, the physical structure of the RIS and
its components may be subject to practical limitations and imperfections. It is
imperative that the hardware imperfections (HWIs) associated with the RIS be
analyzed, so that it remains a feasible technology from a practical standpoint.
Moreover, solutions for mitigating the HWIs must be considered, as is discussed
in this work. More specifically, we introduce a gradient descent optimization
for mitigating HWIs in RIS-aided wideband communication systems. Numerical
results show that the proposed optimization is able to compensate for HWIs such
as the phase-shift noise (PSN) and RIS surface deformations.

Conclusion: 通过频率选择性反射方法，RIS技术能更好地适应宽带信号需求。

Abstract: Recently, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has ushered
in the prospect of control over the wireless propagation environment. By
establishing alternative propagation paths for the transmitted signals, and by
reflecting them in a controllable manner, the RIS is able to improve the signal
reception. However, an aspect often overlooked is the potential bandwidth
restrictions on the wideband signal reflected by the RIS. If not carefully
considered, this can become an impediment for the adoption of the RIS in the
next generation of communications systems. Therefore, in this work we propose a
RIS configuration method that provides frequency selective signal reflection
for wideband signals.

Conclusion: RIS技术与神经网络的结合优化了通信系统性能，而STAR-RIS的引入进一步突破了传统RIS的空间覆盖和信号放大限制，展现了广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology for metasurfaces is
ushering in a new paradigm for wireless communication systems. It provides an
accessible way for controlling the interaction between electromagnetic waves
with the propagation medium. One particularly important aspect is the
configuration of the RIS elements or reflectors. Simply stated, the objective
of the RIS configuration is to choose the optimum phase-shift combination that
maximizes the channel capacity. Recently, neural networks (NNs) were proposed
for tackling this task and results have shown that the proposed NN promotes far
less reconfigurations of the RIS, consequently reducing the configuration
overhead. Beyond that, the RIS can be repurposed for tackling the Doppler shift
in high-mobility communication systems. Despite not being its usual primary
goal, results have also demonstrated that the RIS can compensate for the
Doppler shift at a small cost in performance. However, the typical
reflection-only constraint for RIS systems limits the spatial coverage and
signal amplification potential achieved by such systems. Therefore, the
simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface
(STAR-RIS) can be employed to address these limitations by its dual
functionality of transmitting and reflecting signals concurrently. It can be
shown that the STAR-RIS can augment coverage, energy efficiency, and latency
reduction, while enhancing sum-rate and physical-layer security across several
wireless contexts.

*Nishant Mehrotra,Sandesh Rao Mattu,Saif Khan Mohammed,Ronny Hadani,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Zak-OTFS是一种雷达感知调制方案，通过离散化的延时-多普勒群设计波形，降低计算复杂度并优化模糊函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统连续雷达信号处理复杂度高，希望通过离散化的延时-多普勒群设计方法降低复杂度并优化波形性能。

Method: 在离散化的延时-多普勒域中设计波形，利用离散Heisenberg-Weyl群和辛变换优化模糊表面。

Result: 将计算复杂度从O(B²T²)降低到O(BT log T)，并定义了具有低峰均功率比的雷达波形库。

Conclusion: 离散化延时-多普勒群和辛变换为雷达波形设计提供了一种高效且性能优化的方法。

Abstract: Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler
(DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception,
then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same
architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$
where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is
$\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in
the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return,
then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This
produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity
function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler
shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely
studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of
waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from
the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the
discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of
the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity
surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete
Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal
processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this
complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to
be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete
Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables
defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power
ratios.

Conclusion: 这种集成方法为6G网络中的IIoT连接提供了一个稳健的框架。

Abstract: The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is revolutionizing industrial
processes by facilitating massive machine-type communications among countless
interconnected devices. To efficiently handle the resulting large-scale and
sporadic traffic, grant-free random access protocols-especially coded random
access (CRA)-have emerged as scalable and reliable solutions. At the same time,
advancements in wireless hardware, including extremely large-scale MIMO arrays
and high-frequency communication (e.g., mmWave, Terahertz), are pushing network
operations into the near-field propagation regime, allowing for dense
connectivity and enhanced spatial multiplexing. This paper proposes an
innovative approach that combines near-field spatial multiplexing with the
interference mitigation capabilities of CRA, utilizing an extremely large
aperture array at the access point. This integration improves reliability and
reduces access latency, offering a robust framework for IIoT connectivity in
next-generation 6G networks.

### [8] [Estimation-Theoretic Bias Reduction for Oscillometric Blood Pressure Readings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15687)
*Masoud Nateghi,Reza Sameni*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了振荡法测量血压的系统误差并提出改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 振荡法是血压测量的标准方法，但存在系统误差，影响临床准确性。

Method: 使用最小二乘法和最大似然法校正单次和多次血压测量数据。

Result: 统计方法显著提高了非侵入性血压监测的准确性。

Conclusion: 改进方法对心血管诊断和治疗有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Oscillometry is the standard method for non-invasive, cuff-based blood
pressure (BP) measurement, but it introduces systematic errors that may impact
clinical accuracy. This study investigates the sources of these
errors--primarily the limitations of oscillometry itself and
respiration-induced fluctuations--using BP waveform data from the MIMIC
database. Oscillometry tends to underestimate systolic BP and overestimate
diastolic BP, while respiration introduces cyclical variations that further
degrade measurement precision. To mitigate these effects, we propose an
estimation-theoretic framework employing least squares (LS) and maximum
likelihood (ML) methods for correcting both single and repeated BP
measurements. LS estimation supports conventional multi-measurement averaging
protocols, whereas the ML approach incorporates prior knowledge of measurement
errors, offering improved performance. Our results demonstrate that leveraging
statistical priors across multiple readings can enhance the accuracy of
non-invasive BP monitoring, with potential implications for improving
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

Conclusion: 上下文学习为动态操作任务提供了一种有效的低数据量解决方案。

Abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based
tasks, such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large
Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot
prediction via in-context learning, in which input-output examples provided in
the prompt are generalized to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends
beyond standard language tasks, enabling few-shot learning for general
patterns. In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with
pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation
introduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an
iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show
across several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing
in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

Abstract: Like mammals, robots must rapidly learn to control their bodies and interact
with their environment despite incomplete knowledge of their body structure and
surroundings. They must also adapt to continuous changes in both. This work
presents a bio-inspired learning algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P),
applied to a tendon-driven quadruped robotic system developed and fabricated
in-house. Our quadruped robot undergoes an initial five-minute phase of
generalized motor babbling, followed by 15 refinement trials (each lasting 20
seconds) to achieve specific cyclical movements. This process mirrors the
exploration-exploitation paradigm observed in mammals. With each refinement,
the robot progressively improves upon its initial "good enough" solution. Our
results serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the hardware-in-the-loop
system's ability to learn the control of a tendon-driven quadruped with
redundancies in just a few minutes to achieve functional and adaptive cyclical
non-convex movements. By advancing autonomous control in robotic locomotion,
our approach paves the way for robots capable of dynamically adjusting to new
environments, ensuring sustained adaptability and performance.

Conclusion: Mag-Match为恶劣环境下的地图匹配提供了鲁棒且无需重力对齐的解决方案，扩展了多机器人和多会话数据的应用场景。

Abstract: Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for
localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional
methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information
but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on
the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other
sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce
Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic
vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature
descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is
invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned
mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise
magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform
efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and
its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments

Abstract: Embodied navigation (EN) advances traditional navigation by enabling robots
to perform complex egocentric tasks through sensing, social, and motion
intelligence. In contrast to classic methodologies that rely on explicit
localization and pre-defined maps, EN leverages egocentric perception and
human-like interaction strategies. This survey introduces a comprehensive EN
formulation structured into five stages: Transition, Observation, Fusion,
Reward-policy construction, and Action (TOFRA). The TOFRA framework serves to
synthesize the current state of the art, provide a critical review of relevant

Conclusion: 结论表明Lang2Lift在复杂环境下具有鲁棒性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

Motivation: 提升无人机在动态环境中的任务成功率，并结合大型语言模型的推理能力与严格物理执行约束。

Result: 实验显示SRDrone比基线方法提升44.87%成功率，实际部署达到96.25%成功率。

Conclusion: SRDrone通过自适应任务优化，成功结合了大型语言模型的推理能力与无人机物理执行约束。

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification
model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained
strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience.
Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement
attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within
an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the
general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the
stringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones. Code is

Motivation: 现有的基准测试在高层次语言指令跟随和低级机器人控制之间存在脱节，无法全面评估集成了任务规划和物理执行的系统。

Method: Kitchen-R基于Isaac Sim构建，包含500多条复杂语言指令，支持移动机械臂机器人，并提供了基于视觉-语言模型的任务规划和基于扩散政策的低级控制基线方法。

Result: Kitchen-R提供了三种评估模式：独立评估规划模块、独立评估控制政策以及集成评估整个系统，实现了更全面和现实的基准测试。

Conclusion: Kitchen-R填补了嵌入AI研究中的关键空白，为语言指导的机器人代理提供了更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型策略在灵巧操作中仍存在可靠性和鲁棒性不足的问题，尤其是策略会在某些状态下进入“空闲”状态。此前的方法可能对策略性能产生负面影响，因此研究者探索了一种新的改进方法。

Method: 提出了Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP)方法，在检测到策略空闲状态时施加扰动，帮助策略逃脱吸引力盆，进一步提升性能。

Result: 在模拟的双臂任务中，PIP显著提升了测试性能，无需额外训练或监督；在实际插入任务中，绝对成功率提高了15-35%。

Conclusion: PIP是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著改善策略在灵巧操作中的表现，尤其是在关键运动点上的空闲问题。

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态耦合在自由浮动空间机械臂系统的行为中起关键作用，以往研究多关注最小化耦合，而忽略了其潜在优势。本研究探索如何利用动态耦合优化轨迹规划。

Method: 采用动态耦合矩阵的奇异值分解（SVD）识别主导耦合行为的成分，并制定量化指标描述耦合强度和方向性，将其纳入轨迹优化框架。设计了基于滑模控制的跟踪控制器以评估优化轨迹的可行性。

Result: 模拟结果显示，在轨迹规划中显式考虑动态耦合可实现更高效的操作，为自由浮动空间机械臂系统的控制提供了新方向。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，动态耦合可被有效利用以优化轨迹规划，为SMSs的智能控制开辟了新思路。

Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the
required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.

Method: 提出NeRD模型，替代传统分析模拟器中的底层动力学和接触求解器，采用机器人中心和空间不变的模拟状态表示。

Result: 实验表明，NeRD在千次模拟步骤中稳定且准确，能泛化到新任务和环境，并可通过真实数据微调。

Conclusion: NeRD为机器人模拟提供了一种高效、准确且可泛化的解决方案，能缩小仿真与现实的差距。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with

performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data,
minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel
operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing
dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale
acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for
latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段流程，作者希望提出一种仅需RGB图像的简单且高性能的替代方案。

Method: YOPO通过扩展transformer检测器，加入轻量姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知的匈牙利匹配成本，实现端到端训练。

Result: YOPO在三个基准测试中创下新纪录，例如在REAL275数据集上达到79.6%的IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm精度。

Conclusion: YOPO展示了仅用RGB图像即可实现高性能的姿态估计，缩小了与RGB-D系统的差距。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

Result: 通过仿真验证了轨迹设计和稳定化的有效性。

Conclusion: DVHC方法为欠驱动系统的轨道稳定提供了一种新思路，适用于脉冲输入和连续输入场景。

Abstract: The control problem of realizing propeller motion of a devil-stick in the
vertical plane using impulsive forces applied normal to the stick is
considered. This problem is an example of underactuated robotic juggling and
has not been considered in the literature before. Inspired by virtual holonomic
constraints, the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) is
introduced for the first time to solve this orbital stabilization problem. At
the discrete instants when impulsive inputs are applied, the location of the
center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation
angle. This yields the discrete zero dynamics (DZD), which provides conditions
for stable propeller motion. In the limiting case, when the rotation angle
between successive applications of impulsive inputs is chosen to be arbitrarily
small, the problem reduces to that of propeller motion under continuous
forcing. A controller that enforces the DVHC, and an orbit stabilizing
controller based on the impulse controlled Poincar\'e map approach are
presented. The efficacy of the approach to trajectory design and stabilization
is validated through simulations.

Motivation: 地下无线传感器网络（WUSNs）在恶劣的地下环境中面临资源稀缺和通信覆盖受限等挑战，难以支持可持续的大规模机器通信。

Result: 结果表明，SAGUIN系统结合时间分配策略和适当的LoRaWAN参数配置，能有效延长设备寿命，支持可持续通信。

Conclusion: SAGUIN架构为地下通信提供了可行解决方案，但仍需进一步研究解决关键技术挑战。

Abstract: Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), which enable real-time sensing
and monitoring of underground resources by underground devices (UDs), hold
great promise for delivering substantial social and economic benefits across
various verticals. However, due to the harsh subterranean environment, scarce
network resources, and restricted communication coverage, WUSNs face
significant challenges in supporting sustainable massive machine-type
communications (mMTC), particularly in remote, disaster-stricken, and
hard-to-reach areas. To complement this, we conceptualize in this study a novel
space-air-ground-underground integrated network (SAGUIN) architecture that
seamlessly incorporates satellite systems, aerial platforms, terrestrial
networks, and underground communications. On this basis, we integrate LoRaWAN
and wireless energy transfer (WET) technologies into SAGUIN to enable
sustainable subterranean mMTC. We begin by reviewing the relevant technical
background and presenting the architecture and implementation challenges of
SAGUIN. Then, we employ simulations to model a remote underground pipeline
monitoring scenario to evaluate the feasibility and performance of SAGUIN based
on LoRaWAN and WET technologies, focusing on the effects of parameters such as
underground conditions, time allocation, LoRaWAN spread factor (SF)
configurations, reporting periods, and harvested energy levels. Our results
evidence that the proposed SAGUIN system, when combined with the derived time
allocation strategy and an appropriate SF, can effectively extend the
operational lifetime of UDs, thereby facilitating sustainable subterranean
mMTC. Finally, we pinpoint key challenges and future research directions for
SAGUIN.

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven
methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for
respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant
spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by
these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups,
particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable
in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of
significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed
approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the
potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and
improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more
interpretable results.

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上表现优于传统方法，AUROC和F1分数更高，且预训练时间和计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习为心电分析和生物医学时间序列数据提供高效且可扩展的自监督学习框架。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

Abstract: We address a design of high-capacity and low-peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on
bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) utilizing non-equiprobable and
non-uniform (NENU) constellations as well as clipping and filtering (CAF). The
proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution,
and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform
constellation (NUC), and the latter decreases the number of signal points
without compromising the achievable bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Since
the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only the two parameters,
each associated with NUC and cardinality, the complexity required for the
numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the
constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation
(PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM
receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of
OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate
performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the
receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the
presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of
constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to
simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective Rayleigh fading
channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system
significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded
BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading
channels.
