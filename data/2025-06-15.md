### [1] [Deep Semantic Segmentation for Multi-Source Localization Using Angle of Arrival Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10107)
*Mustafa Atahan Nuhoglu,Hakan Ali Cirpan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种仅利用到达角度测量实现多源定位的深度学习方法，适用于动态环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中多源定位的研究较少，现有方法多为单源定位。

Method: 使用U-Net和U-Net++作为主干模型，通过分析方向线的交点定位多源。

Result: 在单源定位中与传统方法相当，多源定位中在高噪声和多源条件下仍表现准确。

Conclusion: 深度学习在多源定位中具有潜力，尤其是复杂环境下。

Abstract: This paper presents a solution for multi source localization using only angle
of arrival measurements. The receiver platform is in motion, while the sources
are assumed to be stationary. Although numerous methods exist for single source
localization, many relying on pseudo-linear formulations or non convex
optimization techniques, there remains a significant gap in research addressing
multi source localization in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we
propose a deep learning-based framework that leverages semantic segmentation
models for multi source localization. Specifically, we employ UNet and UNetPP
as backbone models, processing input images that encode the platform's
positions along with the corresponding direction finding lines at each
position. By analyzing the intersections of these lines, the models effectively
identify and localize multiple sources. Through simulations, we evaluate both
single- and multi-source localization scenarios. Our results demonstrate that
while the proposed approach performs comparably to traditional methods in
single source localization, it achieves accurate source localization even in
challenging conditions with high noise levels and an increased number of
sources.

### [2] [Quantifying Data Requirements for EEG Independent Component Analysis Using AMICA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10156)
*Gwenevere Frank,Seyed Yahya Shirazi,Jason Palmer,Gert Cauwenberghs,Scott Makeig,Arnaud Delorme*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了ICA在EEG处理中数据量与通道数对分解质量的影响，发现增加数据量对提高分解质量有持续益处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨ICA在处理EEG数据时，数据量与通道数之间的关系及其对分解质量的影响。

Method: 使用AMICA算法对71通道的EEG数据集进行分解，随机子采样数据以模拟不同数据量与通道数比例，并通过MIR和近偶极性评估分解质量。

Result: 增加数据量会提高MIR和近偶极性，但未观察到明确的平台期，表明增加数据量可能持续提升分解质量。

Conclusion: 收集更多EEG数据可能超越常见启发式阈值，持续改善ICA分解质量。

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an important step in EEG processing
for a wide-ranging set of applications. However, ICA requires well-designed
studies and data collection practices to yield optimal results. Past studies
have focused on quantitative evaluation of the differences in quality produced
by different ICA algorithms as well as different configurations of parameters
for AMICA, a multimodal ICA algorithm that is considered the benchmark against
which other algorithms are measured. Here, the effect of the data quantity
versus the number of channels on decomposition quality is explored. AMICA
decompositions were run on a 71 channel dataset with 13 subjects while randomly
subsampling data to correspond to specific ratios of the number of frames in a
dataset to the channel count. Decomposition quality was evaluated for the
varying quantities of data using measures of mutual information reduction (MIR)
and the near dipolarity of components. We also note that an asymptotic trend
can be seen in the increase of MIR and a general increasing trend in near
dipolarity with increasing data, but no definitive plateau in these metrics was
observed, suggesting that the benefits of collecting additional EEG data may
extend beyond common heuristic thresholds and continue to enhance decomposition
quality.

### [3] [Intelligent Travel Activity Monitoring: Generalized Distributed Acoustic Sensing Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10237)
*Ruikang Zhong,Chia-Yen Chiang,Mona Jaber,Rupert De Wilde,Peter Hayward*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习和分布式声学传感（DAS）的系统，用于监测步行、骑自行车等活动，解决了隐私和通用性问题，并通过实验验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取主动出行活动的数据对优化可持续交通系统至关重要，但现有方案需兼顾准确性、经济性、隐私保护和环境适应性。

Method: 使用DAS捕捉环境振动，无需图像或可穿戴设备；提出基于联邦学习的IoT方案和元学习的离线初始化方法以提升通用性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该系统在步行和自行车分类任务中表现出色，并具备良好的通用性。

Conclusion: 该DL增强的DAS系统为大规模监测主动出行活动提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Obtaining data on active travel activities such as walking, jogging, and
cycling is important for refining sustainable transportation systems (STS).
Effectively monitoring these activities not only requires sensing solutions to
have a joint feature of being accurate, economical, and privacy-preserving, but
also enough generalizability to adapt to different climate environments and
deployment conditions. In order to provide a generalized sensing solution, a
deep learning (DL)-enhanced distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system for
monitoring active travel activities is proposed. By leveraging the ambient
vibrations captured by DAS, this scheme infers motion patterns without relying
on image-based or wearable devices, thereby addressing privacy concerns. We
conduct real-world experiments in two geographically distinct locations and
collect comprehensive datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed
system. To address the generalization challenges posed by heterogeneous
deployment environments, we propose two solutions according to network
availability: 1) an Internet-of-Things (IoT) scheme based on federated learning
(FL) is proposed, and it enables geographically different DAS nodes to be
trained collaboratively to improve generalizability; 2) an off-line
initialization approach enabled by meta-learning is proposed to develop
high-generality initialization for DL models and to enable rapid model
fine-tuning with limited data samples, facilitating generalization at newly
established or isolated DAS nodes. Experimental results of the walking and
cycling classification problem demonstrate the performance and generalizability
of the proposed DL-enhanced DAS system, paving the way for practical,
large-scale DAS monitoring of active travel.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于时间感知知识蒸馏的框架，用于从鞋垫传感器数据中估计地面反作用力（GRF），显著提升了可穿戴设备的测量精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然跑步机是测量GRF的黄金标准，但缺乏便携性和高成本限制了其应用。鞋垫传感器虽然便携且低成本，但精度不足。作者旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种时间感知知识蒸馏框架，通过利用小批量数据中的相似性和时间特征，捕捉目标与输入数据之间的互补关系和时序特性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在GRF估计中优于现有基线，提升了可穿戴设备的测量精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为可穿戴设备在GRF测量中的应用提供了更准确且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的智能反射面（HE-IRS），通过结合动态可调元件（DTEs）和静态可调元件（STEs）来平衡性能和功耗。针对这种结构，论文研究了信道估计和波束成形问题，并提出了一种高效的信道估计方案和鲁棒的波束成形算法。仿真结果表明，HE-IRS在降低功耗的同时，保持了与传统IRS相当的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 传统智能反射面（IRS）由于大量反射元件和控制电路的功耗问题，限制了其实际应用。为了平衡性能和功耗，作者提出了一种新型的异质IRS（HE-IRS），但这一结构在信道估计和波束成形方面带来新的挑战。

Method: 论文提出了分解HE-IRS信道为DTE级联信道和STE等效信道的方法，并利用稀疏性和流形优化设计了高效信道估计方案。针对波束成形，提出了离线和在线算法分别优化STE和DTE的相位调整。

Conclusion: HE-IRS是一种绿色解决方案，能够有效解决传统IRS的功耗问题，同时保持性能，为未来IRS设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has gained great attention for its
ability to create favorable propagation environments. However, the power
consumption of conventional IRSs cannot be ignored due to the large number of
reflecting elements and control circuits. To balance performance and power
consumption, we previously proposed a heterogeneous-IRS (HE-IRS), a green IRS
structure integrating dynamically tunable elements (DTEs) and statically
tunable elements (STEs). Compared to conventional IRSs with only DTEs, the
unique DTE-STE integrated structure introduces new challenges in both channel
estimation and beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the channel
estimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel
estimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated
is decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent
channel. Leveraging it along with the inherent sparsity of DTE- and STE-based
channels and manifold optimization, we propose an efficient channel estimation
scheme. To address the rank mismatch problem in the imperfect channel sparsity
information, a robust rank selection rule is developed. For beamforming, we
propose an offline algorithm to optimize the STE phase shifts for wide beam
coverage, and an online algorithm to optimize the BS precoder and the DTE phase
shifts using the estimated HE-IRS channel. Simulation results show that the
HE-IRS requires less pilot overhead than conventional IRSs with the same number
of elements. With the proposed channel estimation and beamforming schemes, the
green HE-IRS achieves competitive sum rate performance with significantly
reduced power consumption.

### [6] [Relaxation-Free Min-k-Partition for PCI Assignment in 5G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10362)
*Yeqing Qiu,Chengpiao Huang,Ye Xue,Zhipeng Jiang,Qingjiang Shi,Dong Zhang,Zhi-Quan Luo*

Main category: eess.SP

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可扩展，适用于大规模5G网络的实时PCI优化，提升性能并降低成本。

Abstract: Physical Cell Identity (PCI) is a critical parameter in 5G networks.
Efficient and accurate PCI assignment is essential for mitigating mod-3
interference, mod-30 interference, collisions, and confusions among cells,
which directly affect network reliability and user experience. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework for PCI assignment by decomposing the problem into
Min-3-Partition, Min-10-Partition, and a graph coloring problem, leveraging the
Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Furthermore, we develop a relaxation-free
approach to the general Min-$k$-Partition problem by reformulating it as a
quadratic program with a norm-equality constraint and solving it using a
penalized mirror descent (PMD) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates
superior computational efficiency and scalability, significantly reducing
interference while eliminating collisions and confusions in large-scale 5G
networks. Numerical evaluations on real-world datasets show that our approach
reduces computational time by up to 20 times compared to state-of-the-art
methods, making it highly practical for real-time PCI optimization in
large-scale networks. These results highlight the potential of our method to
improve network performance and reduce deployment costs in modern 5G systems.

### [7] [A Neural Network-aided Low Complexity Chase Decoder for URLLC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10513)
*Enrico Testi,Enrico Paolini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种结合神经网络预测的增强型Chase-II解码算法，以降低解码尝试次数，适用于URLLC系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: URLLC需要高可靠性和低复杂度的解码算法，现有方法在短码长下性能不足或计算复杂。

Method: 利用神经网络预测扰动模式，减少解码尝试，结合Chase-II的高可靠性和神经网络的效率。

Result: 算法在保证可靠性的同时显著降低计算复杂度，适合时间敏感和资源受限的URLLC应用。

Conclusion: 增强型Chase-II解码算法通过神经网络优化，平衡了性能和复杂度，适用于URLLC场景。

Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand decoding algorithms
that simultaneously offer high reliability and low complexity under stringent
latency constraints. While iterative decoding schemes for LDPC and Polar codes
offer a good compromise between performance and complexity, they fall short in
approaching the theoretical performance limits in the typical URLLC short block
length regime. Conversely, quasi-ML decoding schemes for algebraic codes, like
Chase-II decoding, exhibit a smaller gap to optimum decoding but are
computationally prohibitive for practical deployment in URLLC systems. To
bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced Chase-II decoding algorithm that
leverages a neural network (NN) to predict promising perturbation patterns,
drastically reducing the number of required decoding trials. The proposed
approach combines the reliability of quasi-ML decoding with the efficiency of
NN inference, making it well-suited for time-sensitive and resource-constrained
applications.

Abstract: In this letter, a pinching antennas (PAs) assisted rate splitting multiple
access (RSMA) system with multiple waveguides is investigated to maximize sum
rate. A two-step algorithm is proposed to determine PA activation scheme and
optimize the waveguide beamforming. Specifically, a low complexity spatial
correlation and distance based method is proposed for PA activation selection.
After determining the PA activation status, a semi-definite programming (SDP)
based successive convex approximation (SCA) is leveraged to obtain the optimal
waveguide beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed multiple
waveguides based PAs assisted RSMA method achieves better performance than
various benchmarking schemes.

### [9] [Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10662)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于半被动可重构智能表面（RIS）的硬件架构，旨在提升MIMO通信系统的性能，包括信道估计协议和优化反射系数的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过改进RIS的硬件架构和信道估计方法，提升MIMO系统的频谱效率和通信性能，尤其是在高频段（如FR3及以上）的应用场景。

Conclusion: 所提出的RIS架构和信道估计算法在高频MIMO系统中具有显著优势，为未来无线通信技术提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration
for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple
radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase
profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller
encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and
consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel
channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal
training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable
absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its
signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly
used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase
configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation
algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the
entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank
properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for
communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical
investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation
technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware
configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel
estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized
reflection coefficients of its unit elements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AR眼镜等可穿戴技术的快速发展，需要紧凑、低功耗且能在动态环境中高精度测量的传感器。传统FMCW LFI传感器在短距离、高速度等条件下表现不佳。

Method: 引入了一种四斜坡调制方案，解决了频率符号歧义和频谱盲区问题，并通过实现的流程定义了噪声模型以评估性能。

Result: 该流程在先进硬件上实现了稳健且低噪声的测量，支持低至1厘米距离的精确测量。

Conclusion: 新型传感器处理流程显著提升了在动态环境中的测量性能，解决了传统技术的局限。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wearable technologies, such as AR glasses, demands
compact, energy-efficient sensors capable of high-precision measurements in
dynamic environments. Traditional Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW)
Laser Feedback Interferometry (LFI) sensors, while promising, falter in
applications that feature small distances, high velocities, shallow modulation,
and low-power constraints. We propose a novel sensor-processing pipeline that
reliably extracts distance and velocity measurements at distances as low as 1
cm. As a core contribution, we introduce a four-ramp modulation scheme that
resolves persistent ambiguities in beat frequency signs and overcomes spectral
blind regions caused by hardware limitations. Based on measurements of the
implemented pipeline, a noise model is defined to evaluate its performance and
sensitivity to several algorithmic and working point parameters. We show that
the pipeline generally achieves robust and low-noise measurements using
state-of-the-art hardware.

### [11] [Automotive Radar Online Channel Imbalance Estimation via NLMS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10841)

Abstract: Automotive radars are one of the essential enablers of advanced driver
assistance systems (ADASs). Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and
reliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents
and increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this
context is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the
reliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter
variations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may
affect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In
this work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel
imbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean
squares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to
estimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected
targets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior
knowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in
combination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed
method suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the
normal operation of the radar. Furthermore, it features reduced dependency on
specific targets of interest and faster update rates of the channel imbalance
estimation compared to the majority of state-of-the-art methods. This
improvement is achieved by allowing for multiple targets in the angular
spectrum, whereas most other methods are restricted to only single targets in
the angular spectrum. The performance of the proposed method is validated using
various simulation scenarios and is supported by measurement results.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of wireless networks has resulted in numerous
challenges stemming from their extensive demands for quality of service towards
innovative quality of experience metrics (e.g., user-defined metrics in terms
of sense of physical experience for haptics applications). In the meantime,
large language models (LLMs) emerged as promising solutions for many difficult

LLMs and wireless networks. However, this integration is challenging and needs
careful attention in design. Therefore, in this article, we present a notion of
rational wireless networks powered by \emph{telecom LLMs}, namely,
\emph{LLM-native wireless systems}. We provide fundamentals, vision, and a case
study of the distributed implementation of LLM-native wireless systems. In the
case study, we propose a solution based on double deep Q-learning (DDQN) that
outperforms existing DDQN solutions. Finally, we provide open challenges.

Abstract: The increasing demand for reliable, high-capacity communication during
large-scale outdoor events poses significant challenges for traditional
Terrestrial Networks (TNs), which often struggle to provide consistent coverage
in high-density environments. This paper presents a novel 6G radio network
planning framework that integrates Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to deliver ubiquitous coverage and
enhanced network capacity. Our framework overcomes the limitations of
conventional deployable base stations by leveraging NTN architectures,
including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and passive RIS platforms seamlessly
integrated with Beyond 5G (B5G) TNs. By incorporating advanced B5G technologies
such as Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and beamforming, and by
optimizing spectrum utilization across the C, S, and Ka bands, we implement a
rigorous interference management strategy based on a dynamic SINR model.
Comprehensive calculations and simulations validate the proposed framework,
demonstrating significant improvements in connectivity, reliability, and
cost-efficiency in crowded scenarios. This integration strategy represents a
promising solution for meeting the evolving demands of future 6G networks.

TL;DR: SmoothProper是一种用于无监督变形图像配准的神经网络模块，可解决稀疏特征和大位移挑战，集成优化层以传播信号并保持结构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对稀疏特征和大位移图像配准的挑战，现有无监督方法难以处理，需引入约束以提高配准精度。

Method: 提出SmoothProper模块，结合对偶优化层，在网络前向传播中强制平滑性和消息传递，无需调整超参数。

Result: 在视网膜血管数据集中，配准误差降至1.88像素，首次有效解决大位移和稀疏特征问题。

Conclusion: SmoothPrope作为即插即用模块，显著提升无监督配准性能，适用于高分辨率图像。

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

coding, demonstrating superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to
conventional polar codes. Despite their excellent BER characteristics, these
codes exhibit suboptimal block error rate (BLER) performance, creating a
fundamental BER-BLER trade-off that severely limits their practical deployment
in communication systems. This paper introduces DeepPolar+, an enhanced neural
polar coding framework that systematically eliminates this BER-BLER trade-off
by simultaneously improving BLER performance while maintaining the superior BER
characteristics of DeepPolar codes. Our approach achieves this breakthrough
through three key innovations: (1) an attention-enhanced decoder architecture
that leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture complex
dependencies between bit positions, (2) a structured loss function that jointly
optimizes for both bit-level accuracy and block-level reliability, and (3) an
adaptive SNR-Matched Redundancy Technique (SMART) for decoding DeepPolar+ code
(DP+SMART decoder) that combines specialized models with CRC verification for
robust performance across diverse channel conditions. For a (256,37) code
configuration, DeepPolar+ demonstrates notable improvements in both BER and
BLER performance compared to conventional successive cancellation decoding and
DeepPolar, while achieving remarkably faster convergence through improved
architecture and optimization strategies. The DeepPolar+SMART variant further
amplifies these dual improvements, delivering significant gains in both error
rate metrics over existing approaches. DeepPolar+ effectively bridges the gap
between theoretical potential and practical implementation of neural polar
codes, offering a viable path forward for next-generation error correction
systems.

Abstract: Various approaches in the field of physical layer security involve anomaly
detection, such as physical layer authentication, sensing attacks, and
anti-tampering solutions. Depending on the context in which these approaches
are applied, anomaly detection needs to be computationally lightweight,
resilient to changes in temperature and environment, and robust against phase
noise. We adapt moving average filters, autoregression filters and Kalman
filters to provide predictions of feature vectors that fulfill the above
criteria. Different hypothesis test designs are employed that allow
omnidirectional and unidirectional outlier detection. In a case study, a
sensing attack is investigated that employs the described algorithms with
various channel features based on commodity WiFi devices. Thereby, various
combinations of algorithms and channel features show effectiveness for motion
detection by an attacker. Countermeasures only utilizing transmit power
randomization are shown insufficient to mitigate such attacks if the attacker
has access to channel state information (CSI) measurements, suggesting that
mitigation solutions might require frequency-variant randomization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索心电信号（ECG）和心音信号（PCG）的相互重构及其在心脏功能中的互补作用，理解其在不同生理状态和个体间的信息差异。

Method: 使用EPHNOGRAM数据集，采用线性和非线性机器学习模型（包括非因果LSTM），分析心电和心音信号的相互重构能力，并评估因果性、生理状态和跨个体差异的影响。

Result: 非线性模型（尤其是非因果LSTM）在重构任务中表现最佳；运动状态和跨个体差异增加了重构难度，但基于包络的建模方法提高了跨个体泛化能力；一些临床心电指标（如QT间期）可通过心音信号跨个体估计。

Conclusion: 该研究深入理解了心电和心音信号的关系，为新型多模态心脏监测技术提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.
